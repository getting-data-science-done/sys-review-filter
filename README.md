# Systematic Review Filter

This repository contains the code and data for the paper 'Literature Filtering for Systematic Reviews with Transformers'


## Data

The data used in this work was kindly provided by the Royal Australian College
of Surgeons systematic review team ASERNIP-S.

You can see each of the research questions inside an individual folder within
the [data](data) directory. These datasets are compiled into the final data
set using the script: 


## Experiments

All experiments are written as single executable python 3 scripts in the 
directory [experiments](experiments). Note that these experiments require
the [projit](https://pypi.org/project/projit/) 
library to both access the shared dataset and to stores
results and meta-data about the experiment.

You can execute all experiments using the master script 
[RUN_EXPERIMENTS.sh](RUN_EXPERIMENTS.sh)
