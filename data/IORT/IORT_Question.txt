Looking for studies that demonstrate the equivalence of Xoft Axxent to the Zeiss Intrabeam device when delivering Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy (T-IORT) for the treatment of Early-Stage Breast Cancer and irrespective of device deliving T-IORT, this mode of treatment is non-inferior to "External Beam, Whole Body Radiotherapy" OR EB-WBRT. Can the results of the TARGET-A trial that compared the T-IORT delivered by the Zeiss intrabeam device be extrapolated to the Xoft Axxent device?
