Journal Article,Anonymous,2004.0,RIGScan CR: RIGScan CR49,", ","RIGScan CR49, a 125I-labelled CR monoclonal antibody directed against the tumour-associated antigen TAG-72, is undergoing development with Neoprobe for the intraoperative detection of metastatic colorectal cancer. The Neoprobe's proprietary RIGS (radioimmunoguided surgery) technology combines an injectable radiolabelled cancer-targeting agent and hand-held radiation detection probe that emits an audible tone when located tissue has accumulated a significant amount of the radioactive agent. Neoprobe's RIGS technology also includes a patented surgical method providing surgeons with real-time information to locate tumour deposits that can not be detected by other conventional methods. The RIGS technology has been evaluated in late clinical studies for the detection of adenocarcinomas including primary colorectal, gastrointestinal, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate and neuroendocrine/endocrine. Neoprobe signed an option agreement for its first-generation RIGScan compound, RIGScan CR, with OncoSurg Inc. (formerly NuRigs Ltd). The second-generation humanised RIGScan CR agent was also optionally licensed to OncoSurg Inc. In 1997, Neoprobe filed for approval with the US FDA and the EMEA for RIGScan CR for the intraoperative detection of metastatic colorectal cancer. Both regulatory agencies have requested additional clinical data. On 19 April 2004, Neoprobe announced that it had met with the US FDA to discuss its position on submitting additional clinical information in response to the FDA's questions regarding the Biologic Licence Application (BLA) for RIGScan CR49. The company provided the FDA with new information related to a survival differential for patients whose colorectal cancer was evaluated with RIGScan CR49. The information was not available at the time of the BLA's submission in 1997. The agency indicated that it would consider accepting survival data from one of the two phase III trials, NEO2-14, but not from another trial NEO2-13, as supportive data for a prognostic indication for colorectal cancer. The FDA also clarified that two well controlled studies were required for approval, and indicated that Neoprobe needed to complete an additional confirmatory phase III study for a prognostic indication in colorectal cancer. In its Annual Report 2002, Neoprobe stated that it had been working to secure a partner for further development of its proprietary RIGS technology. The company intends either to find a development partner or sell or licence out their RIGS assets if the partner is not found.",eng,0

Alazraki,2005.0,Update on detection of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer,10.1053/j.semnuclmed.2004.11.003,"Sentinel lymph node biopsy is now the practice of choice for the management of many patients with breast cancer. This was not true in the early 1990s, when the first such procedures were performed and protocols for such were refined often. This was also not true in the first years of the 21st century, when a decade of collective experience and information acquired from numerous clinical investigations dictated additional subtle and not-so-subtle refinements of the procedures. However, it is true today; reports of the latest round of clinical investigations indicate that there are several breast cancer sentinel node procedures that result in successful identification of potential sentinel nodes in nearly all patients who are eligible for such procedures. A significant component of many of these successful sentinel node procedures is a detection and localization protocol that involves radiotracer methodologies, including radiopharmaceutical administration, preoperative nuclear medicine imaging, and intraoperative gamma counting. The present state and roles of nuclear medicine protocols used in breast cancer sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures is reviewed with emphasis on discussion of recent results, unresolved issues, and future considerations. Included are brief reviews of present radiotracer and blue-dye techniques for node localization, including remarks about injection strategies, counting probe technology, and radiation safety. Included also are discussions of on-going investigations of the implications of the presence of micrometastases; of the management value of detection, localization, and excision of extra-axillary nodes such as internal mammary nodes; and of the broad range of recurrence rates presently being reported. Remarks on the present and possible near- and long-term roles for nuclear medicine in the staging of breast cancer patients including comments on positron emission tomography and intraoperative imaging conclude the article.",eng,0

Impact of age, one criterion, on short-term complications/outcomes was evaluated. Methods Institutional Review Board approved retrospective review of early-stage breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving surgery and IORT from January 2011 to June 2013 were reviewed. Data collected were demographics, comorbidities, histopathology, intraoperative data, adjuvant treatment, and outcomes. Local recurrence (LR), re-excision rates, and complications were evaluated by age group using descriptive statistics. Results The total number of patients was 100 (43 patients <70, 57 patients 70). No significant differences existed between groups in tumor size, operative time, estrogen receptor status, nodal status, tumor grade, or margin excision. Wound infection rates were low for both groups (P =.21). Two LR occurred (both patients 70). Median follow-up time was 24 months. Conclusion IORT with its low rate of LR and wound complications may be a reasonable alternative to whole breast irradiation for early-stage breast cancer, regardless of age.

Accelerated partial breast irradiation, including single-session intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), may be an alternative that minimizes treatment demands while providing adequate local disease control and minimal morbidity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of age on outcomes after treatment with BCS and IORT. Methods A multi-institutional retrospective data collection registry was created to collect/combine patient and treatment characteristics from 19 centers utilizing IORT for early-stage breast cancer from 2007-2013. Eligibility criteria were determined at each institution per consensus guidelines. The IORT system was designed to deliver 20 Gy of radiotherapy at the surface of the applicator. The primary endpoint was local recurrence rate and the secondary endpoint was complications. Outcomes were analyzed for ages <70 and >70 using mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range. Comparisons between age categories were made using Welch twosample t test or Wilcoxon sign-rank test. Results The registry cohort included a total of 1,086 patients. This study evaluated 686 patients (all were margin and lymph node-negative, had no additional surgery, and > 6 months of follow-up). Four hundred twenty-four patients were <70 and 262 patients > 70. Mean age for patients <70 was 63 (range: 78, 66) years and 75 (range: 72, 80) years for the > 70 cohort. Patients <70 were more likely to have longer operative times, higher rates of IORT used as planned boost, oncoplastic closure, receive chemotherapy, and postoperative external beam radiation. There were no significant differences between the groups in BMI, tumor histology, size, grade, receptor status, or IORT treatment times. The incidence of wound infection, hematoma, and seroma were not significantly different between the 2 cohorts (Table 1). The median follow-up was 1.06 (range: 0.51, 1.9) years for <70 and 1.01 (range: 0.5, 1.68) years for > 70. There were no axillary recurrences and only 5 (0.73%) breast recurrences (4 in <70 and 1 > 70, p = 0.65) during follow-up. Conclusion On short-term follow-up, patients who received BCS and IORT experienced low local-disease recurrence rates, and the elderly were not at greater risk of wound complications compared to the younger cohort. IORT may be a reasonable alternative to WBXRT for patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with BCS, regardless of advanced age. (Table Presented).",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter trial between 2003 and 2009. Inclusion criteria included age >18 years, core needle biopsy diagnosis of DCIS, and no prior breast cancer history. Patients underwent breast-conserving surgery plus MammoSite placement. Radiation was given twice daily for 5 days for a total of 34 Gy. Patients were evaluated for development of toxicities, cosmetic outcome, and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). RESULTS: A total of 41 patients (42 breasts) completed treatment in the study, with a median follow up of 5.3 years. Overall, 28 patients (68.3%) experienced an adverse event. Skin changes and pain were the most common adverse events. Cosmetic outcome at 6 months was judged excellent/good by 100% of physicians and by 96.8% of patients. At 12 months, 86.7% of physicians and 92.3% of patients rated the cosmetic outcome as excellent/good. Overall, 4 patients (9.8%) developed an IBTR (all DCIS), with a 5-year actuarial rate of 11.3%. All IBTRs were outside the treatment field. Among patients with IBTRs, the mean time to recurrence was 3.2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated partial-breast irradiation using MammoSite seems to provide a safe and cosmetically acceptable outcome; however, the 9.8% IBTR rate with median follow-up of 5.3 years is concerning. Prospective randomized trials are necessary before routine use of APBI for DCIS can be recommended.",eng,0

Gomez,2005.0,[Impact of conservative oncoplastic techniques in a surgery program for women with breast cancer],", ","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of conservative oncoplastic techniques in a surgery program for women with breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study group was composed of women who underwent a conservative oncoplastic technique and the control group consisted of women who underwent conservative (tumorectomy/quadrantectomy) and radical (mastectomy) techniques. Women with tumors smaller than 3 cm, axillary clinical stages N0-N1a-b and multifocal processes (infiltrating and/or in situ) were eligible for inclusion. Women with T3-4 tumors and reduced breast volume, and those in whom postoperative radiotherapy and disease-free margins during intraoperative study were not feasible were excluded. RESULTS: One hundred sixty women underwent surgery during the study period. Fifty oncoplastic techniques (29 to avoid mastectomy and 21 to improve the result of a conservative technique), 57 conservative techniques and 53 mastectomies were performed. The techniques used for breast reconstruction were superior mammoplasty with transversal scar (23 patients), mammoplasty with superior pedicle (10 patients), mammoplasty with inferior pedicle (10 patients), J-shapped mammoplasty (four patients) and oblique mammoplasty (three patients). The mean operating time in the group undergoing oncoplastic techniques (131 minutes) was higher than that in the group undergoing conservative (56 minutes) and radical (93 minutes) techniques. The incidence of postoperative complications was higher with radical techniques (35%), mainly due to axillary seromas after lymphadenectomy, than with conservative (25%) and oncoplastic (24%) techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Oncoplastic techniques are an effective and efficient alternative to conventional surgical techniques in women with breast cancer.",spa,0

Material and Methods: Between May 2008 and April 2010 in 123 breast cancers treated at the Greater Poland Cancer Centre in Poznan (Poland) intraoperative radiotherapy as a tumor bed boost was applied using mobile electron accelerator Mobetron 1000. IORT boost (10 Gy) was followed by 50 Gy whole-breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Chemotherapy, if indicated, was given before EBRT. After tumor excision, aluminium-lead shielding plate was placed on a patient's chest wall, underneath breast tissues. Shielding plates have physical thickness of 0.5 cm (equal to 2 cm of water) and 1 cm (5 cm water equivalent) and diameters from 3 cm to 13 cm with 1 cm step. Appropriate applicator size and tip bevel were chosen to cover whole tumor bed with specified IORT margins. The applicator was then positioned into the breast opening and attached with the clamps to the surgical bed. After that, patient was moved under the Mobetron's head and using soft-docking system applicator was properly positioned against beam central ax.s, Electron energy was precisely chosen to assure possibly homogeneous dose distribution and to deliver 10 Gy to the 90% isodose, which reaches shielding plate surface, independently of tissuethickness. Acrylic bolus caps of 0.5 cm or 1 cm thickness, if needed, were placed on the surface of tumor bed. Results: Median age of treated women was 58 years ranging from 35 to 77. Patients were treated using all available electron beam energies: 6 MeV electron beam energy was used in 57% cases but also 9 MeV, 4 MeV and 12 MeV (27%, 13% and 3% cases respectively) were used for treatment. In 54% cases treatment applicator size (which corresponds to the tumor bed size) was 5 cm in diameter. The smallest used applicator was 4 cm in diameter (11%) and the largest one was 7 cm (used only in 2% cases). Treatment applicators with 0degree, 15degree and 30degree beveled tips were evenly used (33%, 39% and 28% cases respectively). In 55% cases no bolus was needed; 0.5 cm bolus was used in 46 cases (37%). In all treatment procedures aluminium-lead shielding plates were used, 75% of which were 0.5 cm thick. The thickness of irradiated breast gland was less than 1.5 cm in 44% cases and between 1.5 em and 2 em in 42%. Breast gland thicker than 2.5 cm was irradiated rather rarely - only 3% of all treated cases. Conclusion: Intraoperative radiotherapy as a tumor bed boost during breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer using high energy electrons from a mobile linear accelerator seems to be effective and promising treatment procedure.",,0

We sought to determine if patients who experienced complications during the expansion phase were at increased risk for complications or reconstructive failure after the exchange procedure. METHODS: A retrospective review of tissue expander-based breast reconstructions was performed from January 2007 through December 2011. Variables evaluated included age, presence of cancer, tobacco use, body mass index, comorbidities, use of acellular dermal matrix, chemotherapy, radiation, timing of reconstruction (delayed/immediate), intraoperative tissue expander fill, complications, and explantation or salvage of the reconstruction by means of debridement and closure or myocutaneous flap. RESULTS: A total of 196 patients underwent mastectomy with 304 tissue expander reconstructions. Tobacco use (active and remote), hypertension, and radiation were associated with complications. Patients with a salvaged tissue expander complication were 3 times more likely to have a complication after placement of a permanent implant and 9 times more likely to fail permanent implant reconstruction (ie, require explantation). CONCLUSIONS: Women with complications after placement of a tissue expander are at significantly increased risk for both complications and reconstructive failure after placement of a permanent implant. Consideration for earlier autologous reconstruction as a salvage should be strongly considered in patients with a tissue expander complication, particularly in smokers and those undergoing radiation therapy.",eng,0

Materials and methods: Two tools have been developed in our MU calculation software NEMO X to improve the dose homogeneity and the in-vivo dosimetry effectiveness for IOERT treatments. Given the target (tumor bed) thickness measured by the surgeon, NEMO X can provide auto dose normalization to cover 95% of the target volume with 95% of the prescription dose (PD) and a best guess"" of the expected dosimeter dose (EDD) for a deep seated in-vivo dosimeter. The tools have been validated with the data of 91 patients treated with IOERT on a LIAC mobile accelerator. In-vivo dosimetry has been performed with microMOSFETs positioned on the shielding disk inserted between the tumor bed and the chest wall. Results: On average the auto normalization showed to provide better results if compared to conventional normalization rules in terms of mean target dose ( MTD-PD /PD < 5% in 95% vs. 53% of pts) and V107 percentage (<V107> = 19% vs. 32%). In-vivo dosimetry MOSFET dose (MD) showed a better correlation with the EDD guessed by our tool than just by assuming that EDD = PD ( MD-EDD /EDD < 5% in 57 vs. 26% of pts). Conclusions: NEMO X provides two useful tools for the on-line optimization of the dose delivery in IOERT. This optimization can help to reduce unnecessary large over-dosage regions and allows introducing reliable action levels for in-vivo dosimetry. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.""",,0

Once chosen the most appropriate beam energy, a good trade-off between target coverage, entrance dose and tissue over-dosage is to normalize the dose to the R90% (clinical) range. Quite often however, the target is shallower than the beam's range, so normalization to R90% can lead to unnecessary large over-dosage areas. In this work we analyze an automatic tool for dose normalization based on the DVH of the target. Materials: 66 patients which underwent IORT treatment of the breast were investigated. Al the treatments were performed with a LIAC (Sordina, Italy) mobile accelerator producing electrons with nominal energy 4, 6, 8 and 10 MeV collimated through Plexiglas circular applicators. For each treatment an experienced medical physicist provided selection of the beam energy and monitor units (MU) calculation based on the applicator size, daily output of the beam and depth of the target. For each treatment the surgeon measured with a needle ruler the target depth at four different positions; based on these measurements the maximum and minimum depths of the target were recorded. The selected beams were: 8, 10, 6 and 4 MeV in 47%, 43%, 8% and 2% of the treatments respectively. Applicator size was: 5, 6 and 4 cm in 56%, 26% and 18% of the treatments respectively.We developed an extension tool of our Nemo X (www.agolabs.com1) software application for IORT treatments. The tool provides MU calculation for IORT beams based on the applicator-specific dose output and PDD data. Dose normalization can be made to a specific range (e.g. R90%) or to DVH related quantities (median, mean and V95%). The DVH is computed by modelling the target as a cylinder extending from beam entry to the maximum depth of the target. Nemo X provides also a best guess"" of the dose as measured by an in-vivo dosimeter put at the distal end of the target based on the analysis of the PDD in the target depth range.Using Nemo X we computed the mean target dose and the V107% according to the real treatment normalization and in the situation in which the dose is normalized so to cover the 95% of the target with the 95% of the prescribed dose (V95% = D95%). Results: We found that in 35 treatments the mean target dose differed more than 5% from the prescription dose, while using Nemo X's normalization this could have been reduced to 2 treatments (Fig. 1). The V107% analysis shows that the over-dosage areas were usually quite large (<V107%> = 35%) while using Nemo X this drastically reduces to 2%. (Figure presented) Conclusions: We have developed a tool for automatic normalization of IORT electron beams based on the target's DVH. We have shown that this tool can improve the target dose conformity in terms of mean target dose and overdosage.""",,0

APBI in the form of balloon brachytherapy is increasingly selected as a method of radiation treatment (RT). In APBI, accurate dose distribution representation is essential when considering organs at risk (OARs). The presence of inhomogeneities, like air pockets and contrast material in the bone, creates challenges for accurate dose estimation. Current treatment planning systems are based on the TG-43 dose calculation formalism, which assumes full scatter conditions and does not correct for inhomogeneities. Recent advances in dose calculation software have made estimation of the dose that is corrected for inhomogeneities possible. The aim of the current study is to examine the effect of inhomogeneity effects on cardiac and lung dose calculation as estimated by the Acuros BV (Varian) dose calculation algorithm, compared with uncorrected TG-43 doses. Accurate heart and lung dose calculation may be important to minimize long-term toxicity. Materials and Methods: This study looked at 29 MammoSite balloon brachytherapy patients treated with a single central dwell position to 3,400 cGy in 10 bid fractions. Balloon density was overwritten to water in the treatment planning system so as to isolate the tissue inhomogeneity effect. Doses were calculated using both TG-43 and Acuros. Maximum and mean heart dose and lung V20 were recorded. A linear fit was used to characterize the relationship between Acuros and TG-43 calculations of these parameters. Results: Maximum cardiac doses calculated using TG-43 doses ranged from 232 to 4,422 cGy. Maximum cardiac doses as calculated by Acuros were proportional to TG-43 doses. For these patients, a linear fit shows Acuros dose = 0.97 * TG-43 dose (R<sup>2</sup> = .999). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the proportionality constant was 0.963-0.978. For any individual patient, the proportional relationship agreed with the actual Acuros dose to 3 +/- 2%. When examining lung doses, the Acuros lung V20 is about 80% of TG-43 (R<sup>2</sup> = .962). Discussion: In this small cohort of partial-breast balloon brachytherapy patients, we found that differences in cardiac dose between TG-43 and Acuros (~3%) were less than those reported in previous studies on other critical structures, such as ribs (4%-5%) and skin (7%-8%). Compared with these other structures, we hypothesize that the low-density lung between the balloon and heart may be counterbalancing dose decrease due to lack of full scatter, but further study is warranted. As with ribs and skin, Acuros maximum point dose calculation for heart showed a proportional relationship to TG-43. However, the dose-volume parameter, lung V20, displayed larger variance from proportionality, as shown by the lower R<sup>2</sup> value. With evolving technology, it is important to elucidate accurate normal structure dosages to deliver high-quality care in this important patient population. Further study with a larger number of patients is needed to make any definitive recommendations. Our current results appear to be reassuring, in that Acuros-based heart and lung doses are lower than or comparable with TG-43-based calculations.",,0

Patients were implanted with an appropriately sized Axxent balloon applicator based on tumor cavity size and shape. A CT image of the implanted balloon was utilized for developing both eBx and Ir-192 brachytherapy treatment plans. The prescription dose was 3.4 Gy per fraction for 10 fractions to be delivered to 1 cm beyond the balloon surface. Iridium plans were provided by the sites on 35 of the 44 patients enrolled in the study. The planning target volume coverage was very similar when comparing sources for each patient as well as between patients. There were no statistical differences in mean %V100. The percent of the planning target volume in the high dose region was increased with eBx as compared with Iridium (p < 0.001). The mean maximum calculated skin and rib doses did not vary greatly between eBx and Iridium. By contrast, the doses to the ipsilateral lung and the heart were significantly lower with eBx as compared with Iridium (p < 0.0001). The total nominal dwell times required for treatment can be predicted by using a combination of the balloon fill volume and planned treatment volume (PTV). This dosimetric comparison of eBx and Iridium sources demonstrates that both forms of balloon-based brachytherapy provide comparable dose to the planning target volume. Electronic brachytherapy is significantly associated with increased dose at the surface of the balloon and decreased dose outside the PTV, resulting in significantly increased tissue sparing in the heart and ipsilateral lung.",,0

Eicker,2014.0,Marking wire placement for improved accuracy in thoracic spinal surgery,10.1016/j.clineuro.2014.01.025,"OBJECTIVE: To present an innovative approach that does not rely on intraoperative X-ray imaging for identifying thoracic target levels and critically appraise its value in reducing the risk of wrong-level surgery and radiation exposure. METHODS: 96 patients admitted for surgery of the thoracic spine were prospectively enrolled, undergoing a total of 99 marking wire placements. Preoperatively a flexible marking wire derived from breast cancer surgery was inserted with computed tomography (CT) guidance at the site of interest--the wire was then used as an intraoperative guidance tool. RESULTS: Wire placement was considered successful in 96 cases (97%). Most common pathologies were tumors (62.5%) and degenerative disorders (16.7%). Effective doses from CT imaging were significantly higher for wire placements in the upper third of the thoracic spine compared to the lower two thirds (p = 0.015). Radiation exposure to operating room personnel could be reduced by more than 90% in all non-instrumented cases. No adverse reactions were observed, one patient (1.04%) underwent surgical revision due to an epifascial empyema. No wires had to be removed due to lack of patient compliance or infection. CONCLUSIONS: This is a safe and practical approach to identify the level of interest in thoracic spinal surgery employing a marking wire.

Materials and Methods: This study was approved by an institutional review board and was conducted under strict adherence to the Privacy Rule of HIPAA. This was a retrospective review of patients who underwent MammoSite brachytherapy from October 2003 to March 2007. Informed consent for participation in the research project was waived by the institutional review board. Posttherapy mammograms were categorized as showing mild, moderate, or severe distortion and were correlated with patient complaints and complications. Results: Twenty-two women were included in the study, and 93 mammograms were obtained during a median follow-up period of 46 months (range, 22-58 months). Median age was 61 years (range, 47-81 years). One patient developed severe distortion after APBI, while two patients developed only mild distortion throughout follow-up. Eleven (79%) of 14 patients developed moderate distortion, with a median peak in distortion occurring at 21 months. Four (18%) patients developed fat necrosis, two (9%) developed seromas, and two (9%) developed both fat necrosis and seromas. None of the patients required biopsy, and none had an ipsilateral breast recurrence. One patient died of metastatic disease with no evidence of local recurrence. Conclusion: Patients treated with MammoSite APBI developed peak distortion 21 months following therapy, which may be sooner than distortion following conventional whole breast radiation. © RSNA, 2010.",,0

The rapid dose fall-off associated with eBx can provide a lower dose to more distant normal tissue while a lower surface dose can be achieved with <sup>192</sup>lr HDR brachytherapy. This study compares mixed modality treatment plans (MMeBx) with those of eBx and <sup>192</sup>lr HDR alone. Materials and Methods: Planning 3-D CT scans of patients previously treated using a Miami vaginal cylinder, a SAVl breast catheter (Cianna Medical, Aliso Viejo, CA) or a ConturaTM breast catheter (SenoRx, lnc, Aliso Viejo, CA) were re-planned (BrachyVision, Varian Medical Systems, lnc., Palo Alto, CA) for this study. Three plans were generated for each applicator: a standard <sup>192</sup>lr HDR plan, an eBx plan, and a mixed modality plan (MMeBx). ln each plan, loading was optimized based on the individual patient's anatomy. For the MMeBx plan, catheters closest to critical structures were loaded with eBx sources to take advantage of the more rapid dose fall-off. Target volume and normal structures were contoured for each patient. The target volume for the Miami cylinder was defined as a 3.0 mm expansion of the cylinder. For the intracavitary breast catheters, the target volume was defined as a 1.0 cm expansion of the excision cavity less the excision cavity and was retracted from the skin, chest wall, and pectoral muscle as defined by the NSABP B39/RTOG 0413 protocol. Dose was optimized to the PTV surface and normalized such that the %D<inf>90</inf> (relative dose received by 90% of PTV-Eval) was within 5% for all plans. The %V<inf>95</inf> (percent of the target volume receiving 95% of the prescription dose), %V<inf>100</inf>,%V<inf>150</inf>,%V<inf>200</inf>, and %V<inf>300</inf> were extracted from the dose volume histograms for each plan. The Dose Homogeneity Index (DHI, defined as DHI = [(%V100 -%V<inf>150</inf>)/%V<inf>100</inf>]) was calculated for each plan. Results: For all three applicators, the MMeBx plan achieved a superior DHI compared to the eBx or the <sup>192</sup>Ir HDR plan, as shown in Table 1. Dose Homogeneity Index (DHI) In the case of the Miami cylinder, the MMeBx plan also achieved a lower Max Dose Bladder (178.0%) compared with both the eBx (260.5%) and the <sup>192</sup>Ir HDR (213.3%) plans. With regard to the SAVI, the MMeBx plan also achieved a lower Max Skin Dose (78.6%) relative to eBx (96.2%) and <sup>192</sup>Ir HDR (93.6%). The ConturaTM MMeBx plan achieved a lower Max Dose Skin (101.2%) as well (eBx 105.4%; <sup>192</sup>Ir HDR 106.1%). In addition, the MMeBx plan achieved a lower mean dose breast (95.9%) compared with both the eBx (128%) and the <sup>192</sup>Ir HDR (96.4%) plans. Conclusions: Mixed modality brachytherapy (MMeBx) provides the physician with additional dose-shaping flexibility that can be tailored to the individual patient's anatomy and thus can achieve a higher therapeutic ratio.",,0

IORT offers some of the following advantages with typically fewer complications like; maximum effect, sparing healthy tissues and organs, to help the patients finish treatment and get back to their normal activities. The goal of IORT is to improve local tumor control and survival rates for patients with breast cancer. IORT can both be performed with electron beams (ELIOT) and X-rays. Two main randomised trials testing intraoperative partial breast radiotherapy are TARGIT trial and the ELIOT (intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons) trial, but the techniques are fundamentally different. Whereas TARGIT delivers radiation from within the undisturbed tumour bed, for ELIOT, the mammary gland is mobilised, a prepectoral lead shield is inserted, the edges of the tumour bed are apposed, and radiation is delivered from without.

Teh,2015.0,Long-term outcome of accelerated partial breast irradiation using a multilumen balloon applicator in a patient with existing breast implants,10.1016/j.brachy.2014.09.004,"PURPOSE: Accelerated partial breast irradiation is now an accepted component of breast-conserving therapy. However, data regarding long-term outcomes of patients treated with multilumen catheter systems who have existing breast implants are limited. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report the treatment and outcome of our patient who had existing bilateral silicone subpectoral implants at the time of presentation. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of the right breast showed infiltrating mucinous carcinoma. Right breast lumpectomy revealed an 8 mm area of infiltrating ductal carcinoma with mucinous features and nuclear grade 1. A 4-5 cm Contura (Bard Biopsy Systems, Tempe, AZ) device was placed, and she was treated over the course of 5 days twice daily to a dose of 34 Gy using a high-dose-rate iridium-192 source. RESULTS: The planning target volume for evaluation was 73.9 cc. The percentage of the planning target volume for evaluation receiving 90%, 95%, and 100% of the prescribed dose was 99.9%, 99.3%, and 97.8%, respectively. The total implant volume was 234.5 cc and received a mean dose of 15.4 Gy and a maximum dose of 72.8 Gy. The percentage of implant volume receiving 50%, 75%, 100%, and 200% of the prescribed dose was 31.1%, 16.5%, 8.6%, 2.0%, and 0%, respectively. Maximum skin dose was 97% of the prescribed dose. With a followup of nearly 5 years, she continues to be cancer free with minimal late toxicities and good to excellent cosmetic outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated partial breast irradiation using a multilumen balloon applicator in patients with existing breast implants can safely be performed with excellent long-term cosmetic outcome. Further studies are needed to establish the absolute dosimetric tolerance of breast implants.",eng,0

Teh,2016.0,Accelerated partial breast irradiation: advances and controversies,10.1186/s40880-016-0095-1,"The management of localized breast cancer has changed dramatically over the past three to four decades. Breast-conserving therapy, which involved lumpectomy followed by adjuvant irradiation, is now widely considered the standard of care in women with early-stage breast cancer. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), which involves focal irradiation of the lumpectomy cavity over a short period of time, has developed over the past two decades as an alternative to whole breast irradiation (WBI). Multiple APBI modalities have been developed including brachytherapy, external beam irradiation, and intraoperative irradiation. These new techniques have provided early-stage breast cancer patients with shorter treatment duration and more focused irradiation, delivering very high biological doses to the region at a high risk of failures over a much shorter treatment course as compared with conventional radiotherapy. However, the advantages of APBI over conventional radiotherapy are controversial, including a higher risk of complications reported in retrospective literature and shorter follow-up duration in the intraoperative APBI trials. Nevertheless, APBI presents a valuable alternative to WBI for a selected population of women with early-stage breast cancer.",eng,0

In 460 BC Hippocrates described breast cancer as a humoral disease and presently after a lot of studies breast cancer is considered as a local disease with systemic roots. For most of the twentieth century Halsted radical mastectomy was the established and standardized operation for cancer of the breast in all stages, early or late"". New information about tumor biology and its behavior suggested that less radical surgery might be just as effective as the more extensive one. Eventually, with the use of adjuvant therapy likeradiation and systemic therapy, the extent of surgical resection in the breast and axilla got reduced further and led to an era of breast conservation. The radiation treatment of breast cancer has evolved from 2D to 3D Conformal and to accelarated partial breast irradiation, aiming to reduce normal tissue toxicity and overall treatment time. Systemic therapy in the form of hormone therapy, chemotherapy and biological agents is now a well-established modality in treatment of breast cancer. The current perspective of breast cancer management is based on the rapidly evolving and increasingly integrated study on the genetic, molecular <sup>,</sup> biochemical and cellular basis of disease. The challenge for the future is to take advantage of this knowledge for the prediction of therapeutic outcome and develop therapies and rapidly apply more novel biologic therapeutics.""",,0

Complementary use of radionuclide imaging before surgery, intraoperative probe detection, and blue dye have yielded the best reported sensitivities for finding a sentinel node (94%). The importance of imaging is summarized as identifying sentinel node(s), distinguishing sentinel from secondary nodes, guiding surgical incision planning, and facilitating lower doses. The learning curve phenomenon, which applies to the surgeon and the nuclear medicine physician, has been recognized; measures to minimize it are being implemented.

Less is known about the clinical effectiveness of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in DCIS pts. We hypothesized that APBI would provide equivalent local control to whole breast irradiation (WBI) in pts with DCIS. Methods: Following IRB approval, a retrospective chart review from January 2004 to October 2011 identified 123 pts with DCIS treated with breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy. 83 patients received APBI via balloon brachytherapy(98%) or 3D-conformal(2%) and 40 pts with 41 cancers received WBI. Rates of recurrence were evaluated. Results: Median follow up was 38 months. The WBI cohort was younger and more likely to take hormonal therapy than the APBI cohort(p = 0.034); otherwise the groups were similar with respect to tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor status, margin status and family history. There were 5(4%) IBTR at a median of 37 months. The 4-year actuarial IBTR rate was 3.8%. Of 83 APBI cancers, there were 3 IBTR (1 local, 2 elsewhere) compared to 2/41 (elsewhere) IBTR in the WBI cohort. There were no significant differences in the 4-year IBTR rates between pts treated with APBI versus WBI(3.4% vs. 4.2%, p=0.66). On univariate analysis, there was a trend towards a higher risk of IBTR with a positive family history(HR=6.1, p=0.07) and lack of hormonal therapy(HR=5.35, p= 0.13). Otherwise there was no association between age (<50 vs. +/-50), grade, margin status, or type of radiation and risk of IBTR. There were 2 regional(2.4%) recurrences in the APBI group at a median of 51 months compared to none in the WBI group. Conclusions: Pts with DCIS treated with APBI had low rates of IBTR that were comparable to WBI. Type of radiation was not associated with risk of IBTR. There was a slightly higher rate of regional recurrence in pts treated with APBI, although this may be related to tumor biology and not inferiority of APBI. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the safety of APBI in pts with pure DCIS. (Figure Presented).",,0

We designed and performed output measurements for RBE using EBT3 model GafChromicTM film. Materials and Methods: Figure 1.a represents experimental setup used to measure depth dose curve (Fig.1.b) and beam output using a calibrated PTW Markus ion chamber. To improve stability of irradiation beam (26.5 MeV protons) from cyclotron CS30, an aluminum cylinder was added in front of the beam serving as a timed shutter. As beam's energy decreases with depth, measurement depth was scaled using ratio of continuous slowing down approximation (CSDA) ranges at each point. Measured signal, corrected by monitor chamber reading, was scaled by ratio of stopping powers at a given depth for water and air divided by the same ratio in Cobalt. Output was measured at 3 mm depth in the middle of plateau ahead of the Bragg peak, and PDD was normalized at the same depth. Following the TRS398 reference dosimetry protocol for proton beams, output was measured in water in terms of Gy/nC where nC is reading of the monitor chamber. Once the output was known, we calibrated EBT3 film model for doses up to 35 Gy (Fig.1.c) by irradiating film pieces in Solid WaterTM at depth of 3 mm and converting depth to water. For RBE determination, attached breast cell cultures (MCF-7, MCF-12, MDA-MB-231) in 96-well plates were irradiated by the horizontal beam (Fig.1.d). Behind the plate, a piece of film was placed to monitor dose distribution during experiment. The MTT colorimetric dye assay was used to assess cell survival (proliferation inhibition) following irradiation. Results: Depending on the cyclotron current and collimator to surface distance (CSD), outputs ranged approximately from 6.8 Gy/s (10 nA, 165 cm CSD) to 500 Gy/s (100 nA, 75 cm CSD). For each irradiated 96-well plate, a dose image was reconstructed (Fig.1.e) and then scaled by the measured PDD data. Natural Gaussian shape of the beam was used to obtain multiple dose points within the plate from single exposure. Average doses (per well) were used to construct the survival fraction (Fig.1.f). The average RBE of proton beam compared to x-ray at the 50% inhibitory dose was 1.22 (SD = 0.05), which was statistically higher (P = 0.02) than the 1.1 reported for standard proton therapy. Conclusions: We described a radiochromic film-based dose monitoring system that can be used for colorimetric radiobiology assays with low energy proton beams. The relatively higher RBE would be promising for treatment of low laying lesions. Having a sharp dose fall-off behind the Bragg peak, high dose rate proton beam originating from a production cyclotron could further allow for dose escalation protocols in the case of superficial diseases or during intraoperative radiotherapy procedures.

BACKGROUND: The demand for cancer care has increased among the Spanish population, as long as cancer treatment innovations have proliferated. Radiation therapy in breast cancer has evolved exponentially in recent years with the implementation of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiotherapy, image guided radiotherapy and hypofractionation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An original survey questionnaire was sent to institutions participating in the SEOR-Mama group (GEORM). In total, the standards of practice in 969 patients with breast cancer after surgery were evaluated. RESULTS: The response rate was 70% (28/40 centers). In 98.5% of cases 3D conformal treatment was used. All the institutions employed CT-based planning treatment. Boost was performed in 56.4% of patients: electrons in 59.8%, photons in 23.7% and HDR brachytherapy in 8.8%. Fractionation was standard in 93.1% of patients. Supine position was the most frequent. Only 3 centers used prone position. The common organs of risk delimited were: homolateral lung (80.8%) and heart (80.8%). In 84% histograms were used. An 80.8% of the centers used isocentric technique. In 62.5% asymmetric fields were employed. CTV was delimited in 46.2%, PTV in 65% and both in 38.5%. A 65% of the centers checked with portal films.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The distances of the brachytherapy source to the surface of the mammosite balloon were measured in using radiographic images for fractions 1 to 10 for twelve patients. The dose at the balloon surface (nearly 680cGy) and prescription dose of 340cGy at 1cm from the balloon surface were calculated for the different fractions and their dependence on the balloon volume and source position were investigated. RESULTS: The position of the source can be offset from the center of the mammosite balloon by up to 6mm. Deformation of the balloon led to variations in its dimensions by up to 8mm. The dose at 1cm from the balloon surface that covers the lumpectomy site varied by up to 19% from 340cGy along the elongated diameter of the balloon and by up to 40% along the short diameter. Maximal doses to the skin, ribs and lung were 420cGy, 630cGy and 500cGy per fraction, respectively, which depended mostly on their distance from the balloon surface. CONCLUSION: The geometric variations in the shape of the balloon and position of the source can cause lack of dose coverage to the lumpectomy site or create hot dose spots in the surrounding normal tissue that might compromise intended clinical goals. Users as well as vendors should consider correction measures for the deformation of the balloons and the eccentricity of the position of the high dose source.",eng,0

Materials and Methods: We used a validated tradeoff technique to quantify how much additional risk, if any, patients are willing to accept in order to undergo IORT instead of EBRT. Eligible patients were current or past candidates for breast conserving radiation. Factors studied that would possibly affect patients' preference included age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis, working status (full-time, part-time), type of therapy (chemo and/or hormone), ER, PR and HER<inf>2</inf> status, tumor grade, and, if applicable, time since treatment, ability to continue working, type of treatment (IORT or EBRT) or radiation tolerance. We initially presented patients with a slideshow comparing EBRT with IORT, including a slide on the possible link between local recurrence and survival. Patients were then asked whether they would chose to have EBRT or IORT given hypothetical recurrence risks. Two initial Tradeoff Slides were used. The first stated both forms of radiotherapy lead to a 10%, 10 year risk of local recurrence, while the second stated EBRT leads to a 10% risk versus an IORT risk of 20%. These two conditions were used to assess whether the initial risk comparison had an effect on patients' switch points. Subsequent tradeoff slides incrementally increase or decrease the hypothetical rate of recurrence associated with IORT until the subject's preference changes. Results: Data from 58 patients were used to determine the additional risk of 10-year recurrence that patients would accept in order to have IORT instead of EBRT. The median switch point was 12%, or 2% additional risk. There were two outliers, one accepting 45% risk and the other 50% risk for IORT compared to 10% for EBRT. Only 4 patients had switch points <10%; 6 had switch points = 10%, the remaining 48 chose switch points >10%. None of the factors studied affected the median switch point or the percentage of patients selecting higher than 10% risk for IORT. Factors studied included age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis, working status (FT or PT), type of therapy (chemo and/or hormone), ER, PR and HER<inf>2</inf> status, presence of positive lymph nodes, tumor grade, and, if applicable, time since treatment, ability to continue working, type of treatment (IORT or EBRT) or radiation tolerance. Conclusions: Allowing patients to choose between two non-equivalent therapeutic options is common practice in breast cancer treatment. This study shows that some patients would choose to consider radiation treatment that is both experimental and less efficacious at local disease control, if it meets certain extra-therapeutic goals. Thus, it may be appropriate to offer additional choices in radiation.",,1

Modeling can inform this decision by evaluating the tradeoffs between costs, adverse outcomes, and quality of life. Methods: Using a Markov model, a cost-utility analysis compared lumpectomy with Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT) versus standard External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT). Local recurrence rates (LRR) were based on results from the TARGIT trial. For the base case, LRR for EBRT was assumed to progress linearly to an expected 2.4% at 10 years. LRR for IORT was set to 5.5%, resulting in a more than 3-fold increase from the observed, published 4-year rate. Utilities were derived from the literature. Baseline utility for no disease after RT was set to .92 for IORT and EBRT. Medicare CPT codes were used for direct costs and non-medical costs were ascertained. Quality adjusted life years (QALY), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated over 10 years. Results: In the baseline analysis, IORT is less costly than EBRT, but less effective in terms of QALYs. The use of EBRT led to an increase in .011 QALYS (<5 days) but an incremental increase in $2840, resulting in an ICER of more than $250,000 per QALY. For the ICER to decrease to $81,000/QALY the observed LRR for IORT must increase 8.8 fold from the 4-year rate. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the ICER to be affected most by the costs of radiation treatment, LRR, and utility measures for post-lumpectomy IORT and EBRT. If the utility for IORT were increased by .002 (out of 1.000), IORT becomes cost-saving, offering greater QALY's for less cost. Conclusions: The ICER for EBRT is much higher than the accepted willingness-to-pay threshold of $75,000 on the conservative assumption that the utility for no disease after RT is equal for both IORT and EBRT, and that LRR for IORT would more than triple at 10 years. Only a minute improvement in utility for IORT-which is likely since it is a single dose given at time of surgery and avoids multiple visits for EBRT-makes the IORT treatment less expensive and more effective.",,0

In addition to effectiveness data and cost considerations, the preferences of patients should help inform practice. This study was undertaken to explore and quantify preference in choosing between IORT and the current standard, EBRT. Eligible subjects were current or past candidates for breast-conserving surgery and radiation being seen at the University of California, San Francisco Breast Care Center. A trade-off technique varying the risk of local recurrence for IORT was used to quantify any additional accepted risk that these patients would accept to receive either treatment. Patients were first presented with a slideshow comparing EBRT with the experimental IORT option before being asked their preferences given hypothetical 10-year local recurrence risks. Patients were then given a questionnaire on demographic, social and clinical factors. Data from 81 patients were analyzed. The median additional accepted risk to have IORT was 2.3 % (-9 to 39 %), mean 3.2 %. Only 7 patients chose to accept additional risk for EBRT; 22 accepted IORT at no additional risk; and the remaining 52 chose IORT with some additional risk. Patients weigh trade-offs of risks and benefits when presented with medical treatment choices. Our results show that the majority of breast cancer patients will accept a small increment of local risk for a simpler delivery of radiation. Further studies that incorporate outcome and side effect data from the TARGIT-A trial clarify the expected consequences of a local recurrence, and include an expanded range of radiation options that could help guide clinical decision making in this area. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,0

Methods: Using a Markov model, a cost-utility analysis was performed to compare BCS with IORT vs. standard EBRT. Ten year local recurrence rates (LRR) were based on the recent TARGIT trial. The LRR for EBRT was assumed to progress linearly based on the 4 yr median follow-up from the TARGIT trial to an expected 2.4% LRR at 10 years. The IORT LRR was assumed to be 2.5% greater than the EBRT LRR based on TARGIT trial pre-defined non-inferiority margin. Health state utilities were derived from published data; baseline utility for each therapy equal to 0.92. Direct costs for surgical procedures and radiation therapy were estimated using Medicare reimbursements; costs of metastatic states and indirect costs were derived from published data. Years of life, quality adjusted life years (QALY), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over 10 years were calculated. Results: On average, IORT is less costly than EBRT, but also slightly less effective in terms of both life expectancy and QALYs when the utilities of each treatment were assumed to be equal and the IORT LRR was set at the non-inferiority limit. The ICER for moving from IORT to the more effective EBRT was more than $500,000 per QALYs saved, much higher than the typically accepted willingness-to-pay threshold of $75,000. In sensitivity analyses, this result was found to hold for reasonable assumptions about the LRR and utility for IORT; IORT was found to be more cost effective than EBRT as long as the 10-yr LRR for IORT was less than 22%. If the utility for IORT was greater than 0.921, IORT became cost-saving, offering greater QALYs for less cost. Conclusion: Based on the conservative assumptions that the LRR for IORT would more than triple at 10 yrs and that the utility for the two treatments are equal, IORT is significantly more cost-effective than EBRT. Only a minute improvement in utility for IORT, which is not unreasonable given that it is a single dose given at time of surgery, makes the IORT treatment less expensive and more effective. Together, these results strongly suggest that the TARGIT trial results should be considered robust enough to change clinical practice.",,0

We sought to analyze, from a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness of two radiation strategies for early-stage invasive breast cancer: single-dose intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) and the standard 6-week course of WB-EBRT. Methods: We developed a Markov decision-analytic model to evaluate these treatment strategies in terms of life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over 10 years. Results: IORT single-dose intraoperative radiation therapy was the dominant, more cost-effective strategy, providing greater quality-adjusted life years at a decreased cost compared with 6-week WB-EBRT. The model was sensitive to health state utilities and recurrence rates, but not costs. IORT was either the preferred or dominant strategy across all sensitivity analyses. The two-way sensitivity analyses demonstrate the need to accurately determine utility values for the two forms of radiation treatment and to avoid indiscriminate use of IORT. Conclusions: With less cost and greater QALYs than WB-EBRT, IORT is the more valuable strategy. IORT offers a unique example of new technology that is less costly than the current standard of care option but offers similar efficacy. Even when considering the capital investment for the equipment ($425 K, low when compared with the investments required for robotic surgery or high-dose-rate brachytherapy), which could be recouped after 3-4 years conservatively, these results support IORT as a change in practice for treating early-stage invasive breast cancer. © 2013 Society of Surgical Oncology.",,0

Rocco,2012.0,Surgical margins of resection for breast cancer: current evidence,", ","Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer and second main cause of death in women in western countries. Breast-conserving therapy, consisting of lumpectomy and radiation therapy, has become the standard local treatment for T1-T2 breast tumors. There is general agreement that successful breast conservation requires complete tumor excision with a tumor-free"" or ""negative"" margin of resection, but the definition of a negative margin is controversial. A commonly accepted definition of adequate margins requires a 2-mm distance between ink and tumor but opinions range from the original National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project definition of ""no ink on tumor"", to a recommended width of 10 mm or more. The ability to perform real-time molecular imaging analysis of margins during surgery would clearly be a significant advance; several groups have engaged in this effort, with encouraging reports of preliminary data. Further development of such techniques promises to lead to a point at which accurate intraoperative margin evaluation may be possible and may even be combined with therapeutic interventions, using techniques such as photodynamic therapy.""",eng,0

Special reference is made to long term control of disease, cosmetic results and early and late complications. Methods and Materials: Between June 2002 and December 2015, 285 women with early breast cancer underwent High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy using placement of brachytherapy balloon devices for APBI. Ages ranged from 33 to 91 years (median and mean: 67 years). A total of 138 patients had left breast cancer and 147 had right breast cancer. Invasive carcinoma was present in 216 (76%) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in 69 patients (24%). MammoSite devices were placed in 251 patients (88%): 200 single lumen (80%) and 51 multi-lumen (20%), as well as Contura balloons in 34 patients (12%). Twenty three patients (8%) did not complete the entire APBI course due to: bad dosimetry 17 (6%) and unacceptable balloon to skin distance 6 (2%). Balloon brachytherapy in these patients were used as a boost. Two balloons were removed because of positive margins. The remaining 262 patients will be the focus of this presentation. Doses ranged from 30 Gy to 34 Gy (median 32 Gy) in 10 fractions of 3 to 3.4 Gy each, treated twice daily. All patients were treated either with Varian VariSource 200 or VariSource iX afterloader units. Treatment planning was performed using BrachyVision software. All patients underwent initial CT planning with 3D reconstruction. All patients had met the inclusion criteria according to American College of Surgeons (ACS) guidelines: negative margins, tumor dimension less than 3 cm, and no evidence of metastatic disease. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) scale was used to evaluate acute/late toxicity and the Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale for cosmetic results. Results: The follow-up period ranged from 4 to 165 months (median 96 and average 94). Overall survival after 5 years for the entire group was 99.3% Local control was 97 % (198/204). There were 6 (3%) ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTR), of which 1 (<1%) developed a local relapse (LR) in field and 5 (2%) patients developed a new primary tumor elsewhere in the breast. One (<1%) patient developed distant metastases with local control of the primary tumor. Five patients developed other primary tumors (2 brains tumors, 1 pancreas adenocarcinoma and 2 SCLC) Good to excellent cosmetic outcomes were achieved in 81 (40%) and 106 (52%) respectively; and poor to fair were outcomes were noticed in 6 (3%) and 1 (0.5%) patients respectively. Infection developed in 2 (1%). Seroma formation occurred in 117 (57 %) of patients documented by follow up ultrasound and 11 (5 %) developed fat necrosis confirmed pathologically. Conclusions: This study supports the use of accelerated partial breast irradiation APBI using balloon brachytherapy as an effective modality for management of selected patients with early breast cancer and DCIS. Based in this long term results in more than 200 women this technique should be offered to patients with early breast cancer without reservations as an alternative to conventional radiation and or surgery.",,0

Crowe,2012.0,Optimizing surgical margins in breast conservation,10.1155/2012/585670,"Adequate surgical margins in breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer have traditionally been viewed as a predictor of local recurrence rates. There is still no consensus on what constitutes an adequate surgical margin, however it is clear that there is a trade-off between widely clear margins and acceptable cosmesis. Preoperative approaches to plan extent of resection with appropriate margins (in the setting of surgery first as well as after neoadjuvant chemotherapy,) include mammography, US, and MRI. Improvements have been made in preoperative lesion localization strategies for surgery, as well as intraoperative specimen assessment, in order to ensure complete removal of imaging findings and facilitate margin clearance. Intraoperative strategies to accurately assess tumor and cavity margins include cavity shave techniques, as well as novel technologies for margin probes. Ablative techniques, including radiofrequency ablation as well as intraoperative radiation, may be used to extend tumor-free margins without resecting additional tissue. Oncoplastic techniques allow for wider resections while maintaining cosmesis and have acceptable local recurrence rates, however often involve surgery on the contralateral breast. As systemic therapy for breast cancer continues to improve, it is unclear what the importance of surgical margins on local control rates will be in the future.",eng,0

The pathophysiology of persistent pain is complex and includes several pre-, intra and postoperative risk factors for the development of persistent pain after breast cancer treatment (PPBCT). Radiotherapy has been shown to be a risk factor [2]. It raises the question whether intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), with its smaller radiation field may reduce the development of PPBCT. IORT has been compared to external breast radiation therapy (EBRT) in terms of recurrence and survival, in the randomized non-inferiority study, TARGIT-A trial. Using data from this trial, the aim of this study was to compare these two treatments with regard to development of PPBCT. Materials and Methods: A total of 281 patients enrolled between 2007 and 2010 in the TARGIT-A trial (NCT00983684) from the Copenhagen University Hospitals were identified in the local TARGIT database. Exclusion criteria: patients receiving axillary lymph clearence, patients with bilateral disease, recurrence, other cancer, and patients not treated according to protocol. A total of 245 questionnaires were sent out. The response rate was 98%. Two patients were excluded due to insufficient answers in the questionnaire, leaving 239 for final analysis. A detailed questionnaire from a large nationwide study on PPBCT [1] was used. Results: Disease and demographic characteristics in the two groups were similar. Pain prevalence were 33.6% in the EBRT group and 24.6% in the IORT group, which did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.124). Pain intensity was similar, most patients experiencing light pain (NRS <3). Patients in the IORT group reported more pain in other places outside the treatment area (40.6% in the IORT group and 27.7% in the EBRT group p = 0.045). Conclusion: This first study to compare IORT and EBRT in terms of PPBCT, shows that treatment with IORT does not increase the risk of PPBCT, and provides support for the safety of IORT in terms of PPBCT. Any potential positive effect of IORT on PPBCT will require a larger study.",,1

Single fraction, definitive intra-operative radiation (IORT) for breast cancer is ideal for these circumstances but currently is reserved for resource-rich environments. From 2002 to 2005 a pilot series of IORT was conducted in an extremely resource-restricted environment with adaptation of existing infrastructure. We here present long-term followup data. Methods: After clinically complete tumor excision a specially developed applicator was introduced into the tumor bed. An existing after loader with an Ir192 afterloader was used to deliver 21 Gy in a single fraction to the tumor bed. Then the applicator was removed and the wound closed. Further regional and systemic oncologic management followed established protocols. Data recorded were age, menstrual status, stage, complications, recurrence and survival. Results: Thirty nine patients were treated; the average age was 55 years (range: 35-68 years); fourteen patients had TNM stage 1, 22 stage IIA and 2 stage IIB cancers; the majority were infiltrating ductal carcinomas; the mean tumor diameter was 19 mm, 4 patients were node-positive. Early in the series, 2 patients suffered delayed wound healing; after change of the suturing technique no further problems were encountered. After a mean follow-up of 90 months, one patient suffered a local recurrence, four regional recurrences and four have systemic metastases. One patient has died of disease; 2 of unrelated causes for an overall local control rate of 95%, an overall survival of 92% and a disease-specific survival of 95%. Conclusion: In this limited study, IORT using existing after loaders and a low cost, self-developed applicator has similar local control rates as external beam radiation (EBRT). Utilization of scarce health care resource in resource-restricted environments is greatly reduced. Consequently, the series was continued after a hiatus of 5 years due to political problems; since 2010 a further 18 patients have been treated.",,0

We also analyze the influence of several factors on cosmesis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively evaluated 145 patients with primary breast cancer treated by local excision and radiotherapy between January 2000 and May 2001. Cosmetic outcome was evaluated by doctors and patients and was scored as excellent, good, fair or poor. RESULTS: 73% of patients rated cosmesis as excellent or good while the percentage was 71% when rated by radiation oncologists. The degree of cosmesis concordance evaluated by oncologists and patients was low (kappa = 0.3). In our study the variables which significantly influence on the cosmetic outcome were concomitant adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.04) and radiation therapy boost, either by electron beam or brachytherapy (p = 0.013). CONCLUSION: The cosmetic outcome of breast conserving therapy was good. There was a similar rating by the patient and radiation oncologist, but the level of concordance between patients and doctors was low. Factors that significantly influence the cosmesis appear to be concomitant adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy boost.",eng,0

The aim of surveys on clinical practice is to stimulate discussion and optimize practice. In this paper the current Italian radiotherapy practice after breast-conserving surgery for early breast cancer is described and adherence to national and international guidelines is assessed. Furthermore, results are compared with an earlier survey in northern Italy and international reports. Study design. A multiple-choice questionnaire sent to all 138 Italian radiation oncology centers. Results. 48% of centers responded. Most performed breast-conserving surgery when tumor size was le;3 cm. All centers routinely performed axillary dissection; 45 carried out sentinel node biopsy followed by axillary dissection when the sentinel node was positive. Most centers re-excised when resection margins were positive. The median interval between surgery and radiotherapy, when chemotherapy was not administered, was 60 days. Adjuvant chemotherapy was preferably administered before radiotherapy. Regional lymph nodes were never irradiated in 10 centers; in all others irradiation depended on the number of positive lymph nodes and/or involvement of axillary fat and/or tumor location in medial quadrants. All centers used standard fractionation; hypofractionated schemes were available in 6. Most centers used 4-6 MV photons. In 59 centers the boost dose of 10 Gy could be increased if margins were not negative. All centers ensured patient setup reproducibility. Treatment planning was computerized in 59 centers. The irradiation dose was prescribed at the ICRU point in 56 centers and portal films were made in 54 centers. Intraoperative radiotherapy was used in 4 centers: for partial breast irradiation in 1 and for boost administration in 3 centers. Conclusions. Although the quality of radiotherapy delivery has improved in Italy in recent years, approaches that do not conform to international standards persist.",,0

Until the results of randomized phase III studies are available, phase II studies inform about PBI. We report the 5 year results of a phase II prospective study with PBI using interstitial multi-catheter high-dose-rate brachytherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00499057). METHODS: Hundred patients received PBI (4 Gy, twice a day for 4 days, until 32 Gy). Inclusion criteria were: age >/= 40years, infiltrating carcinoma without lobular histology, ductal in situ carcinoma, tumor size </= 2.5 cm, negative surgical margins and axillary lymph nodes. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 60 months late toxicity occurred in 25 patients; the 5-year probability of freedom from late toxicity was 72.6% (95% CI: 63.7-81.7). Tamoxifen was the only significant risk factor for late toxicity. Cosmetic results, judged by physicians and patients, were good/excellent in 98 patients. Three local relapses (1 true, 2 elsewhere) and 1 regional relapse occurred. The 5-year probability of local or regional relapse-free survival was 97.7% (95% CI: 91.1-99.4) and 99.0% (95% CI: 92.9-99.8), respectively.

The patient benefits are significant, since IORT could replace several weeks of fractionated EBRT. We present our initial experiences of IORT using the Zeiss IntrabeamTM system for treating early stage breast cancer and intracranial malignancies. Implementing this treatment modality requires a multidisciplinary approach drawing on the expertise of surgeons, oncologists, medical physicists, anaesthesiologists, nursing staff and pathologists. Team coherence is facilitated by a nurse co-ordinator. We have treated 66 patients in 24 months. For breast tumours, the mean treatment time was 28.54 min and the applicator sizes ranged from 3.0 to 5.0 cm (mode = 4.5 cm). A dose of 5Gy is prescribed to spherical volume of 1cm from the applicator surface. For brain tumours, the mean treatment time was 19.70 min and the applicator sizes ranged from 1.5 to 3.5 cm (mode = 2.5 cm). Mean dose was 11.1 Gy prescribed to a spherical volume of 0.5cm from the applicator surface. A multidisciplinary team is essential for the successful implementation of IORT. This paper describes how, through reliance on an oncology nurse specialist to co-ordinate the programme, we have successfully set-up an IORT service. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.",,0

We discuss how radiobiological modelling enables us to establish a framework, within which we can compare external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). This leads to a determination of the shell of isoeffect in breast tissue, at which very low kV eBT can be considered to be clinically equivalent to standard EBRT. Material and methods: To estimate relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values as a function of dose and irradiation time, we used a modified linear quadratic (LQ) approach, taking into account the ability of this new device, to deliver 20 Gy at the surface of a 40 mm diameter rigid, hollow spherical applicator in less than 2 minutes. In this study, we considered the radiobiological effectiveness of the Papillon+TM X-ray brachytherapy device operating at 30 kV, 0.3 mA producing dose rates in excess of 14 Gy/min. Results: Calculated clinical RBEs ranged from 1.154 at the surface of a 40 mm diameter applicator to 1.100 at 35 mm from the applicator surface for the Papillon+ device. The absolute physical dose D (abs) 30 kV ranged from 20.00 Gy at the applicator surface to 1.20 at 35 mm distant. The product of the isoeffective single dose of <sup>60</sup>Co reference radiation - (RBE)<sup>60</sup>Co, and the RBE corrected standard 2 Gy equivalent dose fractions (EQD<inf>2</inf>) doses, EQD<inf>2</inf> (30 kV) * (RBE) <sup>60</sup>Co ranged from 98.62 Gy at the applicator surface to 1.13 at 35 mm. The 'shell of isoeffect', the value on the X-Axis where the EQD<inf>2</inf> (30 kV) * (RBE) <sup>60</sup>Co line crosses the 50 Gy mark on the Y-Axis, was found to be approximately 3.5 mm beyond the applicator surface. Conclusions: The 'shell of isoeffect' can serve as a useful metric with which to compare the radiobiological effectiveness of low kV eBT with various regimes of conventional EBRT.",,0

We have treated in excess of 75 patients using four Zeiss IntrabeamTM x-ray sources (XRS). To date there has been no published data of any dosimetric intercomparison of this type of x-ray source used at other cancer centres worldwide. This paper describes the design of a simple dosimetry intercomparison phantom for use with these very low kV x-ray sources. A prototype polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantom has been manufactured, the dimensions of which were determined by the dimensions of the XRS, the beam energy and the attenuating properties of PMMA. The phantom is used in conjunction with Gafchromic XR Type-R film (GC-XRR) and its purpose is to measure the absorbed dose at a fixed distance from the effective point source at the tip of the XRS. The utility of this phantom is further enhanced through the use of an interlock, which eliminates the need to use the mobile gantry. We have used this phantom to conduct a qualitative dosimetric intercomparison of four Zeiss IntrabeamTM x-ray sources with positive results. This phantom is low cost, easy to manufacture, simple to use and could be adopted as a standard method of dosimetric intercomparison for IntrabeamTM x-ray sources as this mode of IORT becomes more widespread. © 2007.",,0

It is being investigated whether a single high dose of radiation will impart the same clinical benefit as a standard course of external beam therapy. Our centre has four Photon Radiosurgery Systems (PRS) currently used to irradiate breast and neurological sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PRS comprises an x-ray generator, control console, quality assurance tools and a mobile gantry. We investigated the dosimetric characteristics of each source and its performance stability over a period of time. We investigated half value layer, output diminution factor, internal radiation monitor (IRM) reproducibility and depth-doses in water. The half value layer was determined in air by the broad beam method, using high purity aluminium attenuators. To quantify beam hardening at clinical depths, solid water attenuators of 5 and 10 mm were placed between the x-ray probe and attenuators. The ion chamber current was monitored over 30 minutes to deduce an output diminution factor. IRM reproducibility was investigated under various exposures. Depth-dose curves in water were obtained at distances up to 35 mm from the probe. RESULTS: The mean energies for the beam attenuated by 5 and 10 mm of solid water were derived from ICRU Report 17 and found to be 18 and 24 keV. The average output level over a period of 30 minutes was found to be 99.12%. The average difference between the preset IRM limit and the total IRM count was less than 0.5%. For three x-ray sources, the average difference between the calculated and actual treatment times was found to be 0.62% (n = 30). The beam attenuation in water varied by approximately 1/r(3). CONCLUSION: The x-ray sources are stable over time. Most measurements were found to lie within the manufacturer's tolerances and an intercomparison of these checks suggests that the four x-ray sources have similar performance characteristics.",,0

Despite recent research efforts, the prognosis of patients with GB has remained dismal. Lately, the knowledge of genetic information about gliomagenesis has increased; we even have a classification of the genetic expression of the tumour. The main problem is that at the moment we do not have any therapeutical resources to help us better treat these tumours, as we can do, with others tumours like breast, lung and colorectal cancer. We have also improved on diagnostic imaging, especially with the new MRI sequences; we can now better define the characteristics of the tumour area and the surrounding brain structures, allowing us to adjust resections. Thanks to the most advanced surgery techniques, such as neuronavigation, intraoperative control of the nervous function and the tumour volume, the neurosurgeon is able to complete tumour exeresis with less morbidity. These imaging techniques allow the radiation oncologist to better contour the irradiation target volume, the structures and the organs at risk, to diminish the irradiation of apparently healthy tissue. Nowadays, knowledge of brain stem cells provides new ex- pectations for future treatments. Novel targeted agents such as bevacizumab, imatinib, erlotinib, temsirolimus, immunotherapy, cilengitide, talampanel, etc. are helping classical chemotherapeutic agents, like temozolomide, to achieve an increase in overall survival. The main objective is to improve median overall survival, which is currently between 9 and 12 months, with a good quality of life, measured by the ability to carry out daily life activities.",,0

This form of surgery may result in incomplete excision of the tumor. Iodine-125 labeled titanium seeds are currently used in clinical practice to reduce the number of incomplete excisions. It seems likely that the number of incomplete excisions can be reduced even further if intraoperative information about the location of the radioactive seed is combined with preoperative information about the extent of the tumor. This can be combined if the location of the radioactive seed is established in a world coordinate system that can be linked to the (preoperative) image coordinate system. With this in mind, we propose a radioactive seed localization system which is composed of two static ceiling-suspended gamma camera heads and two parallel-hole collimators. Physical experiments and computer simulations which mimic realistic clinical situations were performed to estimate the localization accuracy (defined as trueness and precision) of the proposed system with respect to collimator-source distance (ranging between 50 cm and 100 cm) and imaging time (ranging between 1 s and 10 s). The goal of the study was to determine whether or not a trueness of 5 mm can be achieved if a collimator-source distance of 50 cm and imaging time of 5 s are used (these specifications were defined by a group of dedicated breast cancer surgeons). The results from the experiments indicate that the location of the radioactive seed can be established with an accuracy of 1.6 mm +/- 0.6 mm if a collimator-source distance of 50 cm and imaging time of 5 s are used (these experiments were performed with a 4.5 cm thick block phantom). Furthermore, the results from the simulations indicate that a trueness of 3.2 mm or less can be achieved if a collimator-source distance of 50 cm and imaging time of 5 s are used (this trueness was achieved for all 14 breast phantoms which were used in this study). Based on these results we conclude that the proposed system can be a valuable tool for (real-time) intraoperative breast cancer localization.",eng,0

This paper outlines our comprehensive strategy for efficient implementation of breast IORT in the community setting based on the automobile industry's Lean Thinking Model. Materials/Methods: Surgical, medical, radiation oncology and nursing departments were included in a multidisciplinary strategy to implement Breast IORT using an electronic brachytherapy (eBx) procedure and the Lean Thinking model. We created a value stream map that enabled the complete door-to-door flow of IORT in the facility and to identify and prioritize areas for improvement. The initial meetings allowed create a value stream around the idea of patients receiving one intraoperative treatment and avoiding 6.5 weeks of conventional radiation to the breast. All worked to develop a plan with multiple checklists, A3s, Kaizen meetings, quizzes, in-services and specific roles. Several complete dry runs in the OR with someone lying on the table to play the patient were completed to ensure that all roles and responsibilities were understood. Results: Fifteen staff members from the finance, nursing, administrative, transport, facilities, surgical and radiation oncology departments met on 3- 6 occasions using a lean thinking approach. The dry runs and meetings revealed several issues regarding the Quality management issues, radiation safety for patient and staff, minimizing extra time under anesthesia for the patient, number of thyroid shields needed, and the need for a separate time out for radiation oncology and physics to conduct a verbal and checklist call out before radiation delivery. Physics and dosimetry staff received a refresher course in sterile technique. A specific draping technique to protect the sterile field during eBx was developed. Facility, transport, and equipment issues were also modified during dry runs. The first real cases were safe and successful with an average of 22 minutes (total including radiation delivery) for the radiation oncologist, 8-10 minutes of actual treatment time, and 10-15 minutes for balloon placement by the surgeon for a total of 30. Conclusions: The use of a Lean Thinking Model allowed surgery, radiation oncology and nursing staffs to unite in an efficient process for practicing IORT in the OR. Supporting clear communications and protocols with educational meetings and staff checklists were key to the success of these efforts.",,0

Randomized and single institution studies in the US and Europe have shown equivalent local control with these radiation techniques used for breast conservation. Materials/Methods: Medicare reimbursement and treatment planning and delivery utilization data were modeled for 4 different breast RT techniques: (1) WBRT-B: 61.20 Gy in 34 fractions; (2) WBRT-accelerated (AC): 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions (3) (APBI) balloon based techniques: 34 Gy in 10 twicedaily fractions (4) (IORT) - intraoperative radiation at the time of breast surgery as only treatment. Costs incurred by payer (i.e., direct medical costs; 2012 Medicare Fee Schedule-MI) and patient (i.e., direct nonmedical costs; time and travel) were estimated. Total societal costs were then calculated for each treatment approach. Results: Reduction in overall treatment time does not guarantee a reduction in total cost savings to payers. The least expensive external beam radiation approach was the (AC) regimen using 16 fractions. Any reduced cost to patients for the HDR brachytherapy-based APBI regimens were overshadowed by substantial increases in cost to payers, resulting in higher total societal costs; the cost of HDR treatment delivery was primarily responsible for the increased direct medical cost. Overall, IORT was the least costly of all the regimens, in terms of costs to society and payers. The traditional APBI approach has the highest reimbursement to physicians over all other techniques. Physician reimbursement and direct medical cost) was greatest to least for APBI, then WBRT-B, AC and IORT respectively. Direct non medical costs to patient were ranked highest to lowest for WBRT-B, AC, WBRT-B and IORT in that order. Conclusions: Current reimbursement does not reflect societal cost considerations. If one were to pursue a partial-breast regimen to minimize patient and payer costs, it would be more advantageous from a societal perspective to pursue IORT. The current reimbursement does not fairly represent the physician work involved to deliver these accelerated treatments. These large discrepancies in physician payments discourage the use of more cost effective breast treatments. Given the equivalent outcomes of some of the accelerated regimens either APBI or IORT or accelerated fractionation (AC), consideration should be given to restructuring or bundling radiation payments for early stage breast cancer.",,0

Treatment involves the use of a 50 KV source, which avoids the need for specialized room shielding. Currently, there is limited clinical outcome data available for APBI treated with electronic brachytherapy, but the treatment delivery, technique and dose are similar to other balloon methods. We report observations and early results with this technique. Materials/Methods: We reviewed our clinical experiences with stage I breast cancer patients whose treatment plan included electronic brachytherapy with a 50 KV source. Twenty-five women with mean-age of 64 years with invasive and non-invasive breast carcinoma underwent treatment after surgical resection. Inclusion criteria were identical to our experience with other APBI methods. Patients with tumors <3 cm with negative sentinel lymph nodes were treated. Skin-to-balloon distance was 7 mm or greater. The plan of treatment included a lumpectomy, placement of a cavity-evaluation device at surgery in the majority of patients. Radiation treatment, delivered at 10 mm from the balloon surface in 10 fractions over 5 days for a total of 34 Gy, 3.4 Gy per fraction, each fraction separated by > 6 hours. Results: Median follow-up at 1 year showed no recurrence of breast cancer. The Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale used for reference to evaluate the cosmetic results. Cosmetic outcomes were excellent at 1-month interval 92% of patients, at 6 months 88% and 100% reported excellent cosmesis after 1 year. A minority of patients experienced mild erythema and seroma formation, which has also been observed when using other methods. Some patients with skin distance between 7 mm-10 mm had more skin related side effects. There is some concern about skin dose for patients with skin to balloon distance less than 10 mm due to the increased skin dose with the technique. Conclusions: Electronic brachytherapy techniques to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation for early stage breast cancer are effective and feasible treatments and similar to iridium based techniques, with excellent cosmetic results, at a short-term follow-up. Increase care with smaller skin to balloon distances (less than 10 mm) is needed due to the dose distribution effects of the 50 Kv source. The portability and ease of use of this cost-effective method is an added advantage.",,0

The randomized phase III TARGiT trial demonstrated similar recurrence rates to WBI and a lower overall toxicity profile. IORT-related effects and early postoperative outcome were assessed. We report our clinical experience using a 50 Kv EBX HDR radiotherapy delivery system using a balloon technique. We assessed institutional postoperative complications, clinical outcome and histological findings in patients undergoing IORT for breast cancer on a physician sponsored study. Methods: 22 patients (median age 71 years, negative LN and tumor less than 3 cm) underwent lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, and concurrent IORT from December 2010 to January 2013. 18 were treated on the study and 4 refused enrollment and elected to be treated off protocol. Patients received IORT (20 Gy) during breast conserving surgery using an EBX technique. WBI was added according to clinical guidelines. Cosmetic results and quality of life were evaluated. Results: Postoperative complications and toxicity was rare without grade 3/4 toxicities. The most frequent postoperative side effects were palpable seroma (8.3%). Erythema grade 1-2 of the breast was found in (13%); whereas in some (3.4%), mastitis. In 80% of the cases patient had IFDCA, the remainder DCIS and tumor size ranged between 0.7 and 2.6 cm (median = 1.0cm). At median 1 year follow-up, no patient suffered a local recurrence. Cosmetic outcome was perceived excellent in most patients and 100% would recommend the procedure. One patient required WBI due to close margins at re-excision. No patient had positive SLN on final path. Conclusions: IORT using electronic brachytherapy as part of breast conservation is safe. The potential advantages of IORT are minimal time needed for cellular repopulation between surgery and radiation treatment, cosmetic outcome and significant logistical advantages and reduced cost. Careful surgical assessment minimizes the need for WBI. Longer follow-up will determine clinical results for cosmetic outcome and local control.",,0

Methods: IORT is delivered as a single-dose Intraoperative radiation treatment. The treatment requires a high level of radiation and surgical expertise. We developed a model of implementation that would improve quality, and radiation safety for patient and staff and reduce the possibility of radiation errors associated with treatment delivery. To achieve this goal, we developed a pre op and Intraoperative Provonost checklist"" approach. We streamlined implementation by developing lists using an ""Lean thinking method"". 1) Initial meeting with senior management for OR, Nursing and Physicians, with brainstorming to create checklists, timelines and identify IORT quality and safety issues 2) Communicated IORT quality and safety plan to all involved staff. In-services presentations were designed for the nursing, surgical and anesthesia staff as well as well-designed quizzes 3) Safety checklist for nursing, physics, OR staff and separate ""time out"" for the Intraoperative radiation portion of the procedure. 4) Two end-to-end dry runs prior to the procedures were performed, modifying the list(s) when necessary. This was found to be a necessary step toward the final goal. 5) Evaluated results of the test run, encouraged feedback 6) stabilized the results and by using evaluations to improve efficiency with IORT procedure. Results: IORT was able to be incorporated as part of our cancer center and operating room practice smoothly and successfully, with all radiation and patient safety procedures followed by staff. Conclusions: We performed a thorough and rigorous implementation program, dedicated to potential quality and radiation safety issues in every aspect of implementing IORT. This allowed for decreased OR time, minimal radiation exposure, to staff and reduced anesthesia time during our implementation of this IORT treatment to our Cancer Center.""",,0
Journal Article,D. W. Arthur; M. M. Morris; F. A. Vicini,2004.0,Breast cancer: new radiation treatment options,", ","Conventional radiotherapeutic treatment for early and advanced breast cancer has been based on broad-field radiation treatment principles that date back several decades. Although these strategies have been successful, newer techniques now offer the ability to incorporate improved target imaging, dosimetric planning, and treatment delivery into the treatment design. These newer techniques include accelerated partial-breast irradiation and hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation for early-stage breast cancer, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for both early and advanced breast cancer. Accelerated partial-breast irradiation and hypofractionated whole-breast radiotherapy are treatment approaches that promise both reduced overall treatment times and the potential for increased use of breast-conservation therapy. IMRT offers unparalleled dose homogeneity and conformality that enables dose reduction to normal structures with the potential to reduce treatment toxicity and improve cosmesis. Based on the published literature, an increasing number of treatment facilities are offering treatment with these techniques. However, further clinical study remains important to thoroughly define the appropriate clinical setting, patient selection criteria, and limitations for each of these innovative treatment approaches.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three dosimetric plans with identical target coverage were generated for each patient for comparison: multilumen multidwell (MLMD); central-lumen multidwell (CLMD); and central-lumen single-dwell (CLSD) loading of the Contura catheter. For this study, a successful treatment plan achieved ideal dosimetric goals and included the following: >/= 95% of the prescribed dose (PD) covering >/= 95% of the target volume (TV); maximum skin dose </= 125% of the PD; maximum rib dose </= 145% of the PD; and V150 </=50 cc and V200 </= 10 cc. RESULTS: Between January 2008 and February 2011, 23 institutions participated. A total of 318 patients were available for dosimetric review. Using the Contura MLB, all dosimetric criteria were met in 78.93% of cases planned with MLMD versus 55.38% with the CLMD versus 37.66% with the CLSD (P </=.0001). Evaluating all patients with the full range of skin to balloon distance represented, median maximum skin dose was reduced by 12% and median maximum rib dose by 13.9% when using MLMD-based dosimetric plans compared to CLSD. The dosimetric benefit of MLMD was further demonstrated in the subgroup of patients where skin thickness was <5 mm, where MLMD use allowed a 38% reduction in median maximum skin dose over CLSD. For patients with rib distance <5 mm, the median maximum rib dose reduction was 27%. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Contura MLB catheter produced statistically significant improvements in dosimetric capabilities between CLSD and CLMD treatments. This device approach demonstrates the ability not only to overcome the barriers of limited skin thickness and close rib proximity, but to consistently achieve a higher standard of dosimetric planning goals.",eng,0

Journal Article,M. A. Astrahan,2004.0,HDR quality assurance methods for personal digital assistants,10.1016/j.meddos.2004.04.003,"An important component of every clinical high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy program is quality assurance (QA). One of the QA recommendations of the AAPM TG59 report is an independent verification on the results of treatment planning. It is desirable for the verification procedure to be as quick and easy to perform as possible and yet to have a high probability of detecting significant errors. The objective of this work is to describe the dosimetric methods and software developed to implement a departmental HDR QA program using personal digital assistants (PDAs). Verification of MammoSite treatment plans is presented as a practical example. PDAs that run the PalmOS were selected for their low cost and popularity among health care professionals. General-purpose applications were developed for linear sources, planar, and volume implants, that estimate the total dwell time of an HDR implant. This value can then be compared to the total dwell time calculated by the primary treatment planning system. The software incorporates the Paterson-Parker (PP) radium tables and the Greenfield-Tichman-Norman (GTN) version of the Quimby radium tables, which have been modified to a form more convenient for HDR calculations. A special purpose application based on the AAPM TG43 formalism was developed for the MammoSite breast applicator. For QA calculations perpendicular to the center of a single Iridium-192 (192I) HDR source, as exemplified by MammoSite treatments, linearly interpolating the PP or GTN tables is equivalent to applying the TG43 formalism at distances up to 5 cm from the source axis. The MammoSite-specific software also offers the option to calculate dosimetry based on the balloon volume. The PDA clock/calendar permits the software to automatically account for source decay. The touch-sensitive screen allows the familiar tabular format to be maintained while minimizing the effort required for calculations. The PP and GTN radium implant tables are easily modified to a form more convenient for HDR calculations. Deploying the HDR versions of the tables as PDA software makes general-purpose HDR QA effortless. For less conventional HDR applications such as MammoSite implants, a QA solution based on the TG43 formalism becomes practical when implemented on a small computer.",eng,0
Journal Article,"M. A. Astrahan; G. Jozsef; O. E. Streeter, Jr.",2004.0,Optimization of MammoSite therapy,", ","PURPOSE: Radiation source anisotropy causes about 10% of a spherically shaped planning target volume surrounding a MammoSite balloon to receive less than the prescribed dose. The principal dose-limiting factor for MammoSite therapy is the dose to the overlying skin. Additional limiting factors potentially include the dose to portions of the heart and lung. The goal of optimization is to deliver the prescribed dose to as much of the planning target volume as possible while avoiding toxicity to adjacent organs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An experimental CT-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment planning system was used to investigate optimization strategies for MammoSite treatment. This system implements a linear optimization of high-dose-rate dwell times on the basis of constraints assigned to points of interest and a set of potential dwell positions. RESULTS: The cylindrical symmetry of the MammoSite catheter limits the optimization process to creating spherical, ellipsoidal, or egg-shaped isodose distributions whose major axis is oriented along the catheter axis. If the dose to a limiting structure, such as skin, is not an issue, the use of multiple dwell positions can compensate for source anisotropy and create a more spherical isodose surface enclosing the planning target volume compared with a single dwell position. When skin becomes a dose-limiting factor, the catheter axis orientation, source anisotropy, dwell position, and dwell weighting can be exploited to limit the skin dose while simultaneously preserving the prescribed dose to as much of the target volume as possible. CONCLUSION: Optimization of MammoSite therapy using multiple dwell positions within the balloon is both possible and practical.",eng,0

In the breast cancer IORT treatment, the organ with higher risk is the lung so we have estimated the dose to the lung by in vivo dosimetry (IVD) using diodes and the alignment of the disk protection with applicator by GAF chromic RTQA. Materials and methods: The treatment of patients with breast cancer has been performed by giving a single dose of 10 Gy (boost treatment) or 21 Gy (exclusive treatment). We use a LIAC by Sordina with electron beams of 6, 8, 10 and 12 MeV, applicator with a diameter from 3 cm to 10 cm and shielding protection disk made of steel-PTFE (3 + 3 mm).

The results obtained from IDV diodes-based compared with experimental measurements allow to evaluate an error of the 13 %. However the average dose to the lung for treatment boost is less than 30 mGy and for exclusive treatment is less than 85 mGy. Measurements performed with GAF Chromic films for checking the alignment disk - applicator showed an average setup error equal to 0,9 cm (max 1,9 cm and min 0.2 cm). The unshielded radiation due to misalignment always occurs towards the medial side of the patient. Conclusions: The dose delivered to the chest wall, measured by diode, allows to estimate a dose to the lung less than 1 % of the prescribed one. As for the error setup, it is possible to suggeste to enlarge the margin required for entry into the cavity of a disk 2 cm in diameter greater than the diameter of the applicator. Analysis of the results suggest to pay close attention to the movements of the bed and the coupling between the applicator at the distal and proximal portion of it. The diode will also be used to measure the dose out of the mammary gland (upper the disk protection) and to evaluate the lung dose to the clinical use of other energies for two modes of prescription dose (boost and exclusive).",,0

Elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS) is a point-contact technique that collects broadband optical spectra sensitive to absorption and scattering within the tissue. A statistical discrimination algorithm was generated from a training set of nearly 3000 clinical spectra and used to test clinical spectra collected from an independent set of nodes. Freshly excised nodes were bivalved and mounted under a fiber-optic plate. Stepper motors raster-scanned a fiber-optic probe over the plate to interrogate the node's cut surface, creating a 20x20 grid of spectra. These spectra were analyzed to create a map of cancer risk across the node surface. Rules were developed to convert these maps to a prediction for the presence of cancer in the node. Using these analyses, a leave-one-out cross-validation to optimize discrimination parameters on 128 scanned nodes gave a sensitivity of 69% for detection of clinically relevant metastases (71% for macrometastases) and a specificity of 96%, comparable to literature results for touch imprint cytology, a standard technique for intraoperative diagnosis.

Methods: The energy of the radiation emitted by the Intrabeam with the different spherical applicators, under 1 and 2 cm of solid water, and under the tungsten impregnated rubber used for shielding of the heart in TARGIT of the breast, was characterized with measurements of half-value layer (HVL). The stability of response of EBT2 was verified inside this range of energies. EBT2 films were calibrated using the red and green channels of the absorption spectrum in the 0-20 Gy dose range delivered by the Intrabeam x-rays. The dependence of film response on temperature during irradiation was measured. For in vivo dosimetry, pieces of radiochromic films wrapped in sterile envelopes were inserted after breast conserving surgery and before TARGIT into the excision cavity, on the skin and on the shielded pectoralis fascia for treatments of the left breast. Results: HVLs of the Intrabeam in TARGIT of the breast correspond to effective energies of 20.7-36.3 keV. The response of EBT2 was constant inside this range of energies. We measured the dose to the target tissue and to organs at risk in 23 patients and obtained an average dose of 13.52 +/- 1.21 Gy to the target tissue. Dose to the skin in close proximity to the applicator was 2.22 +/- 0.97 Gy, 0.29 +/- 0.17 Gy at 5-10 cm from the applicator, and 0.08 +/- 0.07 Gy at more than 10 cm from the applicator. Dose to the pectoral muscle for left breast treatment was 0.57 +/- 0.23 Gy. Conclusions: Our results show that EBT2 films are accurate at the beam energies, dose range, and irradiation temperature found in TARGIT and that in vivo dosimetry in TARGIT with EBT2 films wrapped in sterile envelopes is a feasible procedure. Measured dose to the organs at risk indicates that the technique is safe from side effects to the skin and the heart. © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",,0

Measurements in these conditions are very difficult to carry out; Monte Carlo simulations are, therefore, of great interest. In addition to the ideal clinical situation (shield placed at the depth of R90), several non-ideal situations have been simulated including coneshield misalignment and tilted protections. Materials and Methods: I. Linac: The mobile accelerator is a 12 MeV SORDINA Liac with energies 6, 8, 10 and 12 MeV. The supplied applicators have diameters of 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3 cm. Each one is provided with four different bevelled ends with angles, 0, 15, 30 and 45degree. II. Lung Shields: SORDINA lung shields are discs composed of two layers with two different materials, PTFE (Teflon) and Stainless Steel (316), each one being 3mm thick. The diameter of the protection discs was chosen so that the shields exceeded in 2 cm the diameter of the applicator. III. MC simulation: penEasy was used to simulate both the head and the shields. The approach followed for spectrum optimization was the one described by Iaccarino et al. Lung protections were simulated as if they were immersed in water at a depth corresponding to that of the R90. All calculations have achieved 0.5% of statistical uncertainty (2sigma) at the depth of maximum dose. Results: I. MC simulation of the linac: PDDs and OARs show very good agreement with experimental measurements. Output factors differences are below 2% for cones with diameters over 5cm. The two smallest cones with diameters 3 and 4 cm show differences over 2% and reach 10% for 6MeV and the 3cm diameter applicator. II. MC simulation of lung shields: A comparison of depth-dose curves shows that the absorbed dose dramatically decreases after the protection. Output factors (computed at the depth of maximum dose without shield) are increased by backscatter but this effect is below 1% in most cases. Differences of 2% can be found in 45degree bevelled applicators. III. MC simulation of non-ideal situations: A small misalignment when using bevelled applicators can have clinical implications in dose absorbed in lung. Tilted shields, on the other hand, can produce overdose of the treated volume. (Figure presented) Conclusions: SORDINA lung shields for breast IORT are useful for avoiding absorbed dose in lung and do not significantly increase backscatter in the treated volume. Only 45degree bevelled applicators show a significant increase in output, this effect may be taken into account when performing monitor units calculations. Great care is advised when placing the shields and selecting its diameter, especially with bevelled applicators. An improper placement can have clinical implications in absorbed dose in lung and/or can overdose the treated volume.",,0

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is increasingly used during breast conserving surgery. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate secondary cancer risks after IORT compared to other modalities of breast radiotherapy (APBI - accelerated partial breast irradiation, EBRT - external beam radiotherapy). METHODS: Computer-tomography scans of an anthropomorphic phantom were acquired with an INTRABEAM IORT applicator (diameter 4 cm) in the outer quadrant of the breast and transferred via DICOM to the treatment planning system. Ipsilateral breast, contralateral breast, ipsilateral lung, contralateral lung, spine and heart were contoured. An INTRABEAM source (50 kV) was defined with the tip of the drift tube at the center of the spherical applicator. A dose of 20 Gy at 0 mm depth from the applicator surface was prescribed for IORT and 34 Gy (5 days x 2 x 3.4 Gy) at 10 mm depth for APBI. For EBRT a total dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions was planned using two tangential fields with wedges. The mean and maximal doses, DVHs and volumes receiving more than 0.1 Gy and 4 Gy of organs at risk (OAR) were calculated and compared. The life time risk for secondary cancers was estimated according to NCRP report 116. RESULTS: IORT delivered the lowest maximal doses to contralateral breast (< 0.3 Gy), ipsilateral (1.8 Gy) and contralateral lung (< 0.3 Gy), heart (1 Gy) and spine (< 0.3 Gy). In comparison, maximal doses for APBI were 2-5 times higher. EBRT delivered a maximal dose of 10.4 Gy to the contralateral breast and 53 Gy to the ipsilateral lung. OAR volumes receiving more than 4 Gy were 0% for IORT, < 2% for APBI and up to 10% for EBRT (ipsilateral lung). The estimated risk for secondary cancer in the respective OAR is considerably lower after IORT and/or APBI as compared to EBRT. CONCLUSIONS: The calculations for maximal doses and volumes of OAR suggest that the risk of secondary cancer induction after IORT is lower than compared to APBI and EBRT.",eng,0

METHODS: We prospectively recorded intraoperative transit-time flow measurements (MediStim BF 2004; MediStim AS, Oslo, Norway) in all internal thoracic artery, radial artery, and long saphenous vein conduits in patients undergoing off-pump and on-pump bypass grafting by a single surgeon. We calculated a flow/pressure ratio as a ratio of mean graft flow to mean arterial pressure for all the conduits just before chest closure. RESULTS: Transit-time flow measurements were recorded in 266 grafts (203 off-pump; 63 on-pump) in 100 patients (80 off-pump; 20 on-pump). Overall, mean graft flow (milliliters per minute) was higher for all grafts in the on-pump group despite a significantly lower mean arterial pressure compared with the off-pump group (P < .05). Consequently the flow/pressure ratio was greater for all grafts in the on-pump group (internal thoracic artery 0.55 vs 0.35, radial artery 0.61 vs 0.36, long saphenous vein 0.77 vs 0.55). Overall mean graft flow was significantly greater in the long saphenous vein than in the internal thoracic artery (P < .001) and radial artery (P = .001), but there was no significant difference in mean graft flow in internal thoracic artery or radial artery grafts within each group. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with the off-pump group, the overall mean graft flow and flow/pressure ratio were significantly higher and mean arterial pressure significantly lower for all grafts in the on-pump group. These findings are probably a result of vasodilatation resulting from cardiopulmonary bypass and reactive hyperemia resulting from a period of ischemia. There was no difference in the mean graft flow and flow/pressure ratio of arterial grafts, which were significantly less than for long saphenous vein grafts. In patients with unstable angina and/or hemodynamic instability, in whom rapid and maximum restoration of myocardial perfusion is a priority, potentially lower graft flow in arterial grafts and off-pump surgery should be considered.",eng,0

Evidence supports the feasibility and efficacy of the ICG to identify the SN, however this method has not been prospectively compared with the gold-standard radiotracer method in terms of SN detection rate. METHODS: Between June 2011 and January 2013, 134 women with clinically node-negative early breast cancer received subdermal/peritumoral injection of (99m)Tc-labeled tracer for lymphoscintigraphy, followed by intraoperative injection of ICG for fluorescence detection of SNs using an exciting light source combined with a camera. In all patients, SNs were first identified by the fluorescence method (ICG-positive) and removed. A gamma ray-detecting probe was then used to determine whether ICG-positive SNs were hot ((99m)Tc-positive) and to identify and remove any (99m)Tc-positive (ICG-negative) SNs remaining in the axilla. The study was powered to perform an equivalence analysis. RESULTS: The 134 patients provided 246 SNs, detected by one or both methods. 1, 2 and 3 SNs, respectively, were detected, removed and examined in 70 (52.2%), 39 (29.1%) and 17 (12.7%) patients; 4-10 SNs were detected and examined in the remaining 8 patients. The two methods were concordant for 230/246 (93.5%) SNs and discordant for 16 (6.5%) SNs. The ICG method detected 99.6% of all SNs.

Simulations have been performed using the MCNP5 Monte Carlo Code, in simple geometries comprised of two concentric spheres; the internal consisting of selected concentrations, C, of a radiographic contrast solution in water (Omnipaque 300) to simulate the MammoSite balloon and the external consisting of water to simulate surrounding tissue. The magnitude of the perturbation of delivered dose due to the radiographic contrast medium used in the MammoSite applicator is calculated. At the very close vicinity of the balloon surface, a dose build-up region is observed, which leads to a dose overestimation by the treatment planning system (TPS) which depends on Omnipaque 300 solution concentration (and is in order of 2.3%, 3.0%, and 4.5%, respectively, at 1 mm away from the balloon - water interface, for C=10%, 15%, and 20%). However, dose overestimation by the TPS is minimal for points lying at the prescription distance (d=1 cm) or beyond, for all simulated concentrations and radii of MammoSite balloon. An analytical estimation of the integral dose outside the CTV in the simple geometries simulated shows that dose to the breast for MammoSite applications is expected to be comparable using HDR 60Co and 192Ir sources, and higher than that for 169Yb. The higher enegies of 60Co sources result to approximately twice radiation protection requirements as compared to 169Ir sources.

For elderly patients, a breast conserving therapy should be preferred as in younger patients. In vulvar cancer, an individualized therapy is also possible. In patients with endometrial cancer, the systematic lymphnode dissection should be realized.

Appropriate patient selection for IORT is challenging, and tumor size on imaging is often used as a key selection criteria. The accuracy of imaging modalities in predicting pathologic size is variable and can therefore influence the inclusion or exclusion of patients from IORT. We report characteristics of patients selected for IORT and compare clinical and surgical tumor size to determine the optimal imaging modality, MRI, mammogram, or ultrasound, for patient selection. Methods Patients undergoing IORT using the INTRABEAM System at our institution, starting August 2013, were consented for registration in a prospective database with ongoing recruitment and current enrollment of 50 patients. Demographic, preoperative staging, pre- and post-operative pathology, and surgical and radiation data were collected. We evaluated need for re-excision, postoperative external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and variations between preoperative staging and final pathology. Variability in preoperative tumor size by imaging modalities was compared with final tumor size at surgical excision. Results Patient characteristics included median age of 66 (range, 47-91), 92% postmenopausal. Final pathologic type was 28 IDC, 17 DCIS, 2 mixed type, and 3 ILC. Median preoperative tumor size by imaging was 1.28 cm (range, 0.3-7.6 cm). Mean tumor size at surgical excision was 1.0 cm (range, 0-3.0 cm; sd, 0.69). Four patients required re-excision for positive margins (8%). Seven patients have currently received postoperative EBRT (14%). Choice of preoperative imaging modality was at the discretion of the breast surgeon. The mean difference between final pathologic size and preoperative imaging size for invasive cancers was -0.18 cm for mammogram, -0.10 cm for ultrasound (US), and 0.49 cm for MRI, with mammogram and US underestimating final size and MRI overestimating. The mean difference for DCIS was 0.10 cm for mammogram, -0.15 cm for ultrasound, and 1.62 cm for MRI. MRI was used in 26 of the 50 patients and in 3 of the 4 patients requiring re-excision. No patients requiring re-excision or EBRT had significant underestimation of tumor size on MRI, mammogram, or ultrasound. Conclusion Accuracy of imaging modality can strongly influence patient's eligibility for IORT. Both mammogram and ultrasound showed acceptable accuracy in predicting size. MRI showed significant variability in accuracy with occasional large overestimates of size, most notably in patients with DCIS. Variations in imaging modality did not appear to affect rates of re-excision or EBRT. MRI may occasionally inappropriately exclude patients from IORT based on size criteria but may also show satellite, contralateral, or mammographically occult lesions not otherwise seen. It is likely that a combination of imaging modalities is necessary for accurate evaluation and ongoing followup for local recurrence and survival will further clarify appropriateness of patient selection.",,0

Results: Fifty-five patients (median age 67 years) underwent lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and concurrent IORT from March 2013 to August 2014. Ninety-five percent of patients had invasive ductal histology with a median tumor size of 1.5 cm. Conclusion: Variety of APBI techniques are currently available for clinical use, our early Latin American operative experience with IORT shows it is well tolerated with low morbidity. The addition of WBI may be necessary in situations for positive margns and/or microscopic nodal disease in patients who do no undergo additional surgery. Implementation of IB impacts treatment planning and operating room use a multidisciplinary breast cancer program. The safety profile, ease of administration, and reduced costs of IB favor its more widespread use in high selected patients with early-stage breast cancer.",,0

Kinsella,1990.0,Tumor induction following intraoperative radiotherapy: late results of the National Cancer Institute canine trials,", ","Intraoperative radiotherapy has been employed in human cancer research for over a decade. Since 1979, trials to assess the acute and late toxicity of IORT have been carried out at the National Cancer Institute in an adult dog model in an attempt to establish dose tolerance guidelines for a variety of organs. Of the 170 animals entered on 12 studies with a minimum follow-up of 2 years, 148 dogs received IORT; 22 control animals received only surgery. Animals were sacrificed at designated intervals following IORT, usually at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 60 month intervals. 102 of 148 irradiated dogs were sacrificed less than 24 months; 46 dogs were followed greater than or equal to 24 months after IORT. To date, 34 of the 46 animals have been sacrificed; the 12 remaining animals are to be followed to 5 years. These 12 animals have minimum follow-up of 30 months. In the irradiated group followed for greater than or equal to 24 months, 10 tumors have arisen in 9 animals. One animal developed an incidental spontaneous breast carcinoma outside the IORT port, discovered only at scheduled post-mortem exam. The remaining nine tumors arose within IORT ports. Two tumors were benign neural tumors--a neuroma and a neurofibroma. One animal had a collision"" tumor comprised of grade I chondrosarcoma adjacent to grade III osteosarcoma arising in lumbar vertebrae. Two other grade III osteosarcomas, one grade III fibrosarcoma, and one grade III malignant fibrous histiocytoma arose in retroperitoneal/paravertebral sites. An embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) arose within the irradiated urinary bladder of one animal. No sham irradiated controls nor IORT animals sacrificed less than 24 months have developed any spontaneous or radiation-induced tumors. The time range of diagnoses of tumors was 24-58 months (median 40 months). The IORT dose range associated with tumor development was 20-35 Gy (median 30 Gy). The carcinogenesis capability of single fraction, high dose radiation in animals is discussed, as are the implications of these data for continued research and clinical usage of IORT in the treatment of humans.""",eng,0

Cancer and atherosclerosis go through the same stages of initiation, promotion, and complication, beginning with a mutation in a single cell. Clinical observations before the 1960s lead to the belief that the heart is relatively resistant to the doses of radiation used in radiotherapy. Subsequently, it was discovered that the heart is sensitive to radiation and many cardiac structures may be damaged by radiation exposure. A significantly higher risk of death due to ischemic heart disease has been reported for patients treated with radiation for Hodgkin's disease and breast cancer. Certain cytokines and growth factors, such as TGF-beta1 and IL-1 beta, may stimulate radiation-induced endothelial proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and fibrosis leading to advanced lesions of atherosclerosis. The treatment for radiation-induced ischemic heart disease includes conventional pharmacological therapy, balloon angioplasty, and bypass surgery. Endovascular irradiation has been shown to be effective in reducing restenosis-like response to balloon-catheter injury in animal models. Caution must be exercised when radiation therapy is combined with doxorubicin because there appears to be a synergistic toxic effect on the myocardium. Damage to endothelial cells is a central event in the pathogenesis of damage to the coronary arteries. Certain growth factors that interfere with the apoptotic pathway may provide new therapeutic strategies for reducing the risk of radiation-induced damage to the heart. Exposure to low level occupational or environmental radiation appears to pose no undue risk of atherosclerosis development or cardiovascular mortality. But, other radiation-induced processes such as the bystander effects, abscopal effects, hormesis, and individual variations in radiosensitivity may be important in certain circumstances.",eng,0

Basta,2003.0,[Sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer and primary tumor dimension],", ","INTRODUCTION: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, primary used as an alternative to elective lymph node dissection in melanoma, is being applied successfully in management of patients with breast cancer. The aim of this method in breast cancer is to determine the presence of axillary node involvement while clinically normal axilla. The validity of the sentinel node concept in breast cancer is demonstrated in various studies. The results of identification rates, sensitivity, overall accuracy and false negative rate are so encouraging in most publications, as to implement this concept to every-day surgical practice. There is lack, however, of many fundamental answers pertaining relationship between tumor-size and the results of SLN Biopsy or related surgical standards. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 36 females at the age 33-66, with breast cancer underwent primary surgical treatment with SLN Biopsy in Department of Gynaecology and Oncology Jagiellonian University between 2001-2002. The study inclusion criteria were tumour size-T1, T2. The day before surgery the static scanning was performed after injection of Tc radiolabelled nannocolloid. SLN(s) were identified intraoperatively using a handheld gamma detection probe (Navigator GPS) and intraoperative lymphatic mapping with blue dye (Patent Blau V). After localization and excision of SLN(s), axillary's lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed. RESULTS: In 34 patients SLN Biopsy revealed accumulation of the tracer in axilla, which was classified as SLN. Detection rate was 94.4% (34/36). Overall sensitivity of the procedure was 81%, whereas negative predictive value 92%. False negative rate was 2.2%. Detection rate for T1 tumors was 100% (15/15 cases), and for T2 tumors was 90.4% (19/21 cases). Sensitivity for tumor classified as T1 was 100% (3/3 cases), whereas for tumor T2 was 75% (6/8 cases). CONCLUSION: SLN Biopsy seems to be very interesting alternative to ALND in patients with small tumor's dimension.",pol,0

The 20-year data from studies about the safety and efficacy of lumpectomy with full-breast radiation therapy support the safety of this regimen and its role to decrease the risk of ipsilateral recurrence and increase long-term survivorship of women with breast cancer. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) provides radiation therapy to the tumor bed but spares the remaining breast tissue. APBI accelerates the time required to complete the therapy regimen, with a range of one intraoperative session to five consecutive days compared to five to seven weeks. Several techniques exist to administer APBI, including the insertion of a balloon into the lumpectomy space. Of interest is the widespread use of APBI in community and academic settings that has preceded outcomes of large, randomized clinical trials. Because of selection bias in a number of small, single-institution, nonrandomized studies, published data are of limited value to ensure APBI as a standard of care.",eng,0

The expectation of life amongst women in the UK is now 85 so a fit elderly"" woman of 70 has many years left for the natural history of breast cancer to express itself. Never the less the older the woman with breast cancer the more likely she is to die of co-morbidity. The first point to make therefore is that age alone should not be a determinant of therapy but that should remain a decision based on the stage and biological variables within the primary tumour. In spite of all that there may be a place to compromise on default therapies if the expectation of life of the woman is say less than three years. I will illustrate these points by focussing on three trials with which I've been actively involved. The first are the trials comparing surgery plus tamoxifen versus surgery alone in women over the age of 70, secondly the TRAGIT trial of intra-operative radiotherapy and thirdly the ATAC trial comparing tamoxifen with arimidex. I will argue that surgery is still required in primary therapy in the elderly whose expectation of life exceeds 3 years but also there is room for a new trial of aromatase inhibitors as sole therapy for women with tumours that express the ER and are say 80 years or more at presentation. I also believe that there is a place for IORT for women with serious co-morbidity and I will argue that there may be an age of transition when tamoxifen might be favoured above aromatase inhibitors as first line adjuvant therapy.""",,0

The primary endpoint was local recurrence in the conserved breast. Methods: Randomisation was to TARGIT or EBRT in a 1:1 ratio. If allocated to TARGIT, patients in whom adverse risk factors were discovered on the final pathology report could receive EBRT (the risk-adapted approach). Patients allocated to receive EBRT received conventional whole-breast radiotherapy according to local practice. The primary outcome was ipsilateral within breast recurrence (IBR) with an absolute non-inferiority margin of 2.5% at 5 years. Secondary outcomes included survival and local toxicity/morbidity. Exploratory analyses included loco-regional recurrence, 'all recurrence' (ipsilateral or contralateral breast, axilla or distant), distant recurrence, and cause of death. Results: In total, 3451 women were randomised from 33 centres in 10 countries between 2000 and 2012. Median follow-up of the whole cohort was 2 years 5 months. 2020 patients have a median 4 y follow up and 1222 patients have median 5 y follow up. For the primary outcome of ipsilateral breast recurrence, the absolute difference at 5-years was 2.01% (0.32 to 3.7%), which was higher with TARGIT but was within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 2.5% (Table 1). For the secondary outcomes, there was a non-significant trend for improved overall survival with TARGIT [HR = 0.70 (0.46- 1.07)] due to fewer non-breast cancer deaths [17 vs. 35, HR 0.47 (0.26-0.84)]. Conclusion: The risk-adapted approach of TARGIT, using a single dose of radiotherapy at the time of surgery (with the option of adding EBRT if required) is non-inferior to conventional EBRT for the primary endpoint of IBR. There was no difference in overall survival, but a non significant trend favouring TARGIT. (Table Presented).",,0

Br Cancer.1996;74:820-4) Methods: Having safely piloted a new technique of partial breast irradiation (Vaidya JS, Baum M, Tobias JS et al Ann Oncol 2001;12:1075-80) we launched the TARGIT-A trial in March 2000 comparing TARGIT vs. standard whole breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after breast conserving surgery in patients >45 years with invasive duct carcinoma. LR was the primary outcome measure (core protocol: www.thelancet.com/protocol-reviews/99PRT-47). Trial accrual from 31 international centers is complete (n=2232), with 80% power to detect a difference in relapse rate of 2.5% - the non-inferiority margin. Results: Median age was 63 (IQR 57-69), median tumor size 13mm (IQR 9-18mm), lymph nodes 17%+ve. Median follow-up is 24.6 months (max 10 years). Wound breakdown or delayed healing were reported in 28 of the TARGIT group and 20 in the EBRT group (p=0.24). RTOG grade 3 toxicity (nil grade 4) was seen in 6 vs. 21 (p=0.004) respectively. Overall local toxicity was equivalent (34/1092 TARGIT v. 41/1096 EBRT, p=0.42). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of LR in the breast, was 0.31% (CI 0.08-1.26) for TARGIT versus 0.29% for EBRT (CI 0.07-1.16) at 24 months. Conclusions: In the TARGIT group, the radiotherapy toxicity was significantly lower than in the EBRT group, while the increase in wound complications was not statistically significant. This analysis suggests that at a median follow-up of 24 months the local control with TARGIT is comparable to EBRT. Longer term follow-up is essential and accrual in similar studies is encouraged.",,0

This kind of treatment has several advantages such as 'geographical' precision and shortening of the overall treatment time by c. 20 %. However, from the viewpoint of external beam radiotherapy or afterloading there might also exist some disadvantages such as high dose inhomogeneity, lack of imaging, and merely coarse treatment planning without external dosimetric checks. Therefore, in this work external dosimetry is presented and some aspects regarding the applicator size is discussed. Methods: To perform external dosimetry using a soft x-ray chamber (PTW 23342) with the Intrabeam System, a suitable PMMA slab phantom with spherical holders was built. According to the pathological results (weight) available from our first nearly 100 treatments, resection volumes were calculated and related to the applicators actually used (ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 cm diameter, 5 mm steps). Depth dose curves (PDD) were used to calculate irradiated volumes for the various applicators which were related to the resected tissue. Results: External absolute and relative (PDD) dosimetry are in good accordance to the internal dosimetry of the Intrabeam System. [2] There was a tendency over time to use smaller applicators (from 3.7 cm to below 3.0 on average). In most treatments, the applicator used was smaller than the resection volume. The irradiated volumes according to the depth dose curves and the spherical geometry differ considerably between the different applicators (e.g. the volume receiving at least 7 Gy ranging from 7 for the smallest to 116 ccm for the largest). Conclusions: The internal dosimetry of the Intrabeam and the PDD data provided by the manufacturer could be confirmed by our measurements. Though the PDD and the absolute dose seem to be well defined, the part played by the applicator size might be more critical than previously thought. E.g. if the 'correct' size would be 3.0 cm but the selected diameter is 2.5 cm, then only about 60 % of volume would receive at least 7 Gy compared to the 3.0 cm applicator (ideal fit assumed). As one consequence, in case of close margin of the frozen section one should rather choose the larger applicator (to treat more volume, hence a larger safety margin). It seems worthwhile to select the applicator size according to the perioperatively determined weight of the surgically resected tissue. This could possibly lead to either less risk of recurrence or on the long run to a reduction of the prescribed dose.",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 50 women were treated on a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of intraoperative radiotherapy at wide local excision. The eligibility criteria included age >60, tumor size </=2.0 cm, clinically negative lymph nodes, and biopsy-established diagnosis. After wide local excision, a custom breast applicator was placed in the excision cavity, and a dose of 20 Gy was prescribed to a depth of 1 cm. After 18 patients were treated, the dose was constrained laterally to 18 Gy. The cosmetic outcome was evaluated by photographs at baseline and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Four examiners graded the photographs for symmetry, edema, discoloration, contour, and scarring. The grades were evaluated in relationship to the volume of irradiated tissue, tumor location, and dose at the lateral aspects of the cavity.

Materials/Methods: Fifty-two women with early stage invasive breast cancer were treated on a pilot study at our center to evaluate the feasibility of IORT given in 1 fraction at the time of wide local excision. Eligibility criteria included age.60, tumor size <2.0cm, clinically negative lymph nodes, no clinical or radiographic evidence of multicentricity, and biopsy established diagnosis. The median age was 67 years (range: 45-87). After WLE, a custom sized modified HAM applicator was placed in the excision cavity and a dose of 20 Gy was prescribed to a depth of 1 cmof breast tissue in all directions except the deep margin where it was prescribed to 5mm. After 18 patients were treated, the technique was changed so that the lateral aspects of the cavity received 18 Gy at 1 cm. Following IORT 3 patients received chemotherapy and 29 received hormone therapy. Following IORT patients were followed with annual mammography and routine physical examinations every 3-4 months for 1 year and then every 4-6 months to date. Results: The median follow up was 68 months (range: 3-95). At time of analysis 45 (87%) patients were alive and 7 (13%) were deceased of causes unrelated to their breast cancer. The 5 year overall survival was 86% and the 5 year local control rate was 93%. 4 patients had local recurrences in the treated breast; 3 were discovered on routine MMG and 1 had a non-healing wound biopsy; on original pathology at time of IORT 1 had positive margins, 2 had close margins, and 1 had high grade disease with extensive lymphovascular invasion extending to the margin. 1 patient refused further therapy due to advanced age (88 years) and 3 were managed with mastectomy and are now without evidence of disease. No patients developed distant metastases. Prior to their breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, 8 women had other cancers, 3 of whom had 2 prior cancers (3 contralateral breast, 3 colon, 2 endometrial, 1 lymphoma, 1 ovarian, 1 renal cell). After IORT 7 women developed other cancers (3 lung, 2 endometrial, 2 pancreatic); the median age at time of 2nd cancer diagnosis was 82 years (range 67-87). The cosmetic results as described in a prior study remained stable or improved. Conclusions: In this pilot study of IORT for breast cancer, the local control was good with local failures limited to patients who had close or positive margins. This form of accelerated partial breast radiation is feasible, logistically very convenient, and well tolerated for this group of patients who are advanced in age and who have multiple medical co-morbidities. The rate of other cancers in this group of patients is somewhat high and underscores the importance of screening studies for patients with a previous cancer diagnosis.",,0

This was followed by external radiotherapy to the breast of up to 46 Gy and one application of brachytherapy with needles inserted into the surgical bed, and administering 7 Gy to 90% with high dose rate (HDR). RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 43 months, only one patient had therapeutic failure in the implant area, and local control was 98.5%. Another patient had a 2nd tumour in a different quadrant and 3 developed metastasis. Survival at 5 years was 98.7%. Acute toxicity was minimal, with excellent or good cosmetic appearance in 95%.

To avoid over- or under-treatment, local-regional treatment should be similarly targeted based in individual tumor/host characteristics. The MammaPrint 70-gene assay defines high- and low- risk groups that have a ~30% and 10% risk of 10-year distant recurrence risk prior to adjuvant treatment. We hypothesize that the MammaPrint 70-gene assay is predictive of local-regional recurrence in early-stage breast cancer patients undergoing breast conservation therapy. Method: From a database of 1534 breast cancer patients with a median follow-up of 7.2 years, we analyzed the local-regional recurrence rate of a group of 594 node-negative patients who had breastconserving therapy. All patients had negative margins and received postlumpectomy radiation, 170 received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 165 patients with ER+ cancers received adjuvant hormonal therapy. The patients were prospectively followed and clinical outcomes, including distant recurrence, survival, and local-regional recurrence, were recorded. Known risk factors at the time of diagnosis for local regional recurrence, including tumor size, ER status, Her2 status, and grade, were included in our analysis, in addition to the MammaPrint 70-gene analysis. Results: Patients undergoing breast conservation, identified by MammaPrint as low risk, had a localregional recurrence risk of 3.9% at 5 years and 11.9% at 10 years. The MammaPrint high- risk patients had a local-regional recurrence risk of 18.5% at 5 years and 35.6% at 10 years. The MammaPrint highrisk patients who were also high grade had a local-regional recurrence risk of 23.7% at 5 years and 41.5% at 10 years. Univariate analysis of risk factors known at the time of diagnosis revealed that ER neg, high grade, and MammaPrint high risk were statistically significant predictors of local-regional recurrence. However, when multivariate analysis was performed, high grade and MammaPrint high risk were the only predictors of local-regional recurrence. Chemotherapy use did decrease local regional recurrence but is not a variable known at the time of diagnosis. Conclusions: In node-negative patients undergoing breast conservation therapy, the MammaPrint 70- gene assay is predictive of local regional recurrence risk. MammaPrint analysis could help define patients who would benefit from more comprehensive treatment (nodal irradiation, tumor bed boost, or mastectomy +/- reconstruction), as well as identify a patient subgroup that may be safely treated with a targeted approach (partial breast irradiation or IORT). The MammaPrint 70-gene assay allows for a more individualized approach to local-regional therapy.",,0

This observational, nonrandomized, multicenter study evaluated EBT as a post-surgical adjuvant radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer. Methods: This study included women aged 50 years or more with invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor size <3 cm, negative lymph node status, and negative surgical margins. The endpoints were skin and subcutaneous toxicities, efficacy outcomes, cosmetic outcomes, and device performance. In this interim report, 1-month, 6-month, and 1-year follow-up data are available on 68, 59, and 37 patients, respectively. Results: The EBT device performed consistently, delivering the prescribed 34 Gy to all 69 patients (10 fractions/patient). Most adverse events were Grade 1 and included firmness, erythema, breast tenderness, hyperpigmentation, pruritis, field contracture, seroma, rash/desquamation, palpable mass, breast edema, hypopigmentation, telangiectasia, and blistering, which were anticipated. Breast infection occurred in two (2.9%) patients. No tumor recurrences were reported. Cosmetic outcomes were excellent or good in 83.9%-100% of evaluable patients at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year.

Studies that use WBI, however, typically report higher tumor bed recurrence rates than elsewhere failures (EF) (historically considered new primary lesions). The rate of true recurrence (TR) versus EF was queried for a large patient cohort treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). METHODS: A total of 1,449 cases of early-stage breast cancer were treated on the American Society of Breast Surgeons MammoSite((R)) Registry Trial with lumpectomy plus balloon-based APBI (34 Gy, 10 BID fractions). A total of 1,255 cases (87 %) had invasive breast cancer, and 194 patients (13 %) had ductal carcinoma in situ. Rates of TR versus EF were calculated and compared to historical WBI controls. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 60 (range 0-109) months. Fifty patients (3.5 %) developed an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). The 5-year actuarial rate of IBTR was 3.6 % (invasive breast cancer 3.6 %, ductal carcinoma in situ 3.4 %). Fourteen IBTR (1.1 %) were TR, while 36 (2.6 %) were EF. Estrogen receptor-negative status was associated with IBTR for invasive malignancies as well as for EF only (p < 0.001). Trends for increased rates of EF were noted for increased tumor size (p = 0.067) and extensive intraductal component (p = 0.087). No pathologic factors were explicitly associated with TR. CONCLUSIONS: IBTR after balloon-based APBI is low and similar to rates reported for WBI. In this data set, APBI had fewer tumor bed recurrences (presumably initial cancer recurrences) than EF (presumably new primary lesions). This suggests that balloon-based APBI has a tumor bed control rate that is at least equal to (and potentially higher than) WBI.",eng,0

Before performing IORT, primary tumor was evaluated during surgery by a pathologist to confirm the eligibility criteria and to guarantee safe surgical margins. Prescription dose depends on tumor size; if < 1 cm total planned dose was 18 Gy, if > 1cm (up to 2.5 cm) the pts received the standard dose of 21 Gy. Using alpha/beta ratio for breast tumor of 4 Gy, 21 Gy in 1 fraction would be biologically equivalent to 70 Gy in 35 fractions, such a dose being suitable for high risk pts (pT1c and pT2): 18 Gy (equivalent to 60 Gy in 30 fractions) seems to be appropriate for low risk pts (pT1a-pT1b). Full-dose intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons was delivered using a LIAC (Sordina, Padova, Italy), a mobile linear accelerator delivering an electron beam with energies ranging from 4 to 10 Mev. After tumor removal, breast gland was separated from skin and pectoralis major muscle and was sutured over a dedicated shielding disk; this procedure allows excellent sparing of skin, subcutaneous tissue and chest wall. From April 2010, in-vivo dosimetry was performed using a metaloxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) detector placed on the outer face of the shielding disk. Results: From September 2009 to November 2010 136 pts met the protocol pre-surgical eligibility criteria approved at our Institute. Eligibility criteria were confirmed at extemporary pathological examination in 97 pts (71%) who therefore received IORT only; 58 (60%) received 21 Gy and the other 39 (40%) received 18 Gy. 39 (29%) pts were not considered eligible to exclusive IORT; 20 were treated with IORT boost (10 Gy) followed by whole breast radiation, whereas 19 pts did not receive IORT at all. Definitive pathology report supported intraoperative diagnosis of ductal invasive carcinoma in 88 cases; in the other 9 cases it was mucinosus carcinoma (2), apocrine carcinoma (1), tubular carcinoma (1), cribriform carcinoma (3) and lobular carcinoma (2). The time consumption due to IORT procedure is modest even when in-vivo dosimetry is performed, being no more than 30 minutes. Cosmetic outcomes with IORT are satisfying (good or excellent in 77% pts). Conclusions: IORT is feasible in selected pts with low risk early breast cancer, and the procedure-related time consumption is not an issue in our experience.",,0

Bosc,2013.0,The standard tangential fields used for breast irradiation do not allow optimal coverage and dose distribution in axillary levels I-II and the sentinel node area,10.1093/annonc/mdt151,"BACKGROUND: Recent data from ACOSOG Z0011 and NSABP B32 trials suggested no need for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with micrometastatic involvement of the sentinel lymph node (SLN). The low rate of axillary recurrence was attributed to the axilla coverage by the tangential fields (TgFs) irradiation and systemic therapy. This study aimed to evaluate dose distribution and coverage of the axilla levels I-II and the SLN area. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and nine patients were analyzed according to three groups: group 1 (50 Gy; n = 18), group 2 (60 Gy; n = 34) and group 3 (66 Gy; n = 57). Patients were treated using the standard (STgF; n = 22) or high (HTgF; n = 87) TgF. RESULTS: The median doses delivered to level I using HTgF versus STgF were 33 and 20 Gy (P = 0.0001). The mean dose delivered to the SLN area was only 28 Gy. Additionally, the SLN area was totally included in the HTgF in 1 out of 12 patients who had intraoperative clip placement in the SNL area. CONCLUSIONS: TgFs provide a limited coverage of the axilla and the SNLB area. This information should be considered when only TgFs are planned to target the axilla in patients with a positive SLN without ALND. Standardization of locoregional radiotherapy in this situation is urgently needed.",eng,0

Based on the numerous studies which have reported that the local recurrences occurs within and surrounding the primary tumor site and in order to decrease the treatment duration and its morbidity, partial breast irradiation using several techniques has been developed. Partial irradiation may be considered as an alternative local adjuvant treatment for selected patients with favorable prognostic factors. Using external beam radiation therapy, the 3D-conformal technique is appropriate to deliver the whole dose to a limited volume. In UK, an intraoperative technique using a miniature beam of low energy of x-ray (50 Kv) has been developed (Targit). Milan's team have developed an intraoperative electrons beam radiotherapy using a dedicated linear accelerator in the operative room. In USA and Canada the MammoSite has been advised for clinical use in per-operative brachytherapy of the breast. These two last techniques are currently compared in phase III randomised studies to the standard whole breast irradiation followed by a tumour bed booster dose.

Our objective was to evaluate the MammoSite device performances after an open cavity placement procedure and quality of life in highly selected patients with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2003 to March 2005, 43 patients with T1 breast cancer were enrolled in a phase II study. The median age was 72 years. Twenty-five (58%) patients were treated with high-dose rate brachytherapy using the MammoSite applicator to deliver 34Gy in 10 fractions. The main disqualifying factor was pathologic sentinel node involvement (10/43; 23%). There were no device malfunctions, migration or rupture of the balloon. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 13 months, there were no local recurrences and one contralateral lobular carcinoma. Seventeen (68%), 13 (52%), 8 (32%), 5 (20%) and 2 (8%) patients had erythema, seroma, inflammation, hematoma and sever infection, respectively. Only 2 patients developed telangiectasia. At 1 year the rate of good to excellent"" cosmetic results was 84%. Significant changes in QoL were observed for emotional and social well-being between 3 and 12 months. At 24 months, only emotional well-being subscore changes were statistically significant (p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our data in patients older than 60 years support the previously published data. Histologic features were the main disqualifying criteria. With higher skin spacing levels we observed very low incidence of telangiectasia. QoL evaluation indicates that baseline scores were satisfactory. Changes concerned emotional and social well-being.""",eng,0

Our goal is to test whether non-coding RNAs could be implicated in modification of breast microenvironment after surgery and/or TARGIT. Methods: We collected two specimens of normal peritumoral mammary gland from 30 early breast cancer (EBC) patients: one immediately after surgical removal of the tumor and the other 30 minutes after surgery or TARGIT application. Total RNA was extracted and miRNA expression evaluated by microarray technology and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). We used 14 paired samples as discovery set in microarray and 30 paired samples during validation by qRT-PCR. In vitro experiments in normal mammary epithelial cells and tumor derived breast cancer cells were performed, to evaluate the role of identified miR. Results: The act of surgery modified the expression of 134 miRNA (miR) while TARGIT treatment modified the expression of 90 miR. 55 miRNA were differentially expressed in TARGIT versus control post-surgery breast tissues. Among the different regulated miR, miR-223 and miR-34a appeared to be the most highly and significantly modified. Their modification by TARGIT or surgery was then confirmed by qRT-PCR. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrated that EGF and HGF are potential targets of miR-223 and miR-34a, respectively. In vitro analyses in normal and tumor derived cell lines validated the bioinformatic prediction. Accordingly, HGF and EGF expression is modulated by TARGIT and/or surgery in EBC patient samples. Conclusion: TARGIT modulates the expression of miRNAs that in turns modify the expression of two growth factors known to be important in the regulation of cancer cell growth and motility. These data confirm that TARGIT affects the local microenvironment and suggest that more specific and localized therapies against these two growth factors may help to prevent local recurrences formation in EBC patients.",,0

Lancet, 376: 91-102, 2010). We recently demonstrated that TARGIT treatment affects the tumor microenvironment, after breast conserving surgery, by altering the local production of several growth factors and cytokines. Eventually, these changes in the proteomic profile, result in a lower activation of the p70S6K pathway in breast cancer cells (Belletti et al. CCR, 14: 1325-32, 2008). To dissect the role of p70S6K in breast cancer cells proliferation, motility and invasion, we generated genetically modified human breast cancer cell lines expressing specific shRNA or carrying a dominant negative form of p70S6K (p70KR) and tested their ability to grow and migrate, first in vitro then in vivo. Growth curve experiments on MDA MB 231 and MDA MB 453 mammary carcinoma cells, demonstrated that expression of the p70KR mutant slightly reduced the growth rate of these cells. The same cells have been also characterized for their ability to migrate in 2D- and 3D-contexts, in response to the wound fluids harvested from EBC patients as chemoattractants, showing that p70KR reduced their ability to invade. Next, we moved to an in vivo model to evaluate more in detail the involvement of p70S6K in the local recurrence of breast cancer. To this aim, parental or p70S6K genetically modified breast cancer cells have been injected in female nude mice mammary fat pads. Two weeks later, the tumor was removed by surgical excision and the mice observed for the appearance of recurrences. Macroscopic and histo-pathological examination of the primary tumors revealed that despite formation of similar masses, only tumors derived from parental cells displayed lymph-vascular invasion. More importantly, only mammary pads injected with parental cells developed recurrent disease and, at pathological analysis, displayed nodal metastasis. Altogether these data highlight a crucial function of p70S6K in the formation of local recurrence in breast cancers, and support the hypothesis that, in EBC patients, an anti-p70S6K specific therapy may be useful for the prevention of local recurrences.",,0

The proportional reduction of this risk by radiotherapy does not depend on the extent of surgery, suggesting that radiotherapy, in addition to killing tumor cells, may influence the tumor microenvironment. Experimental Design: We studied how normal and mammary carcinoma cell growth and motility are affected by surgical wound fluids (WF), collected over 24 h following breast-conserving surgery in 45 patients, 20 of whom had received additional TARGeted/ntraoperativeradioTherapy (TARGIT), immediately after the surgical excision. The proteomic profile of the WF and their effects on the activationof intracellular signal transduction pathways of breast cancer cells were also analyzed. Results: WF stimulated proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cell lines. The stimulatory effect was almost completely abrogated when fluids from TARGIT-treated patients were used. These fluids displayed altered expression of several cytokines and failed to properly stimulate the activation of some intracellular signal transduction pathways, when comparedwith fluids harvested from untreated patients. Conclusions: Delivery of TARGIT to the tumor bed alters the molecular composition and biological activity of surgical WF.

This report presents the 5-year results of the treated patients. Methods: From May 2000 to October 2001, 70 patients were enrolled in this prospective study. Forty-three patients completed accelerated partial breast irradiation with MammoSite brachytherapy following lumpectomy and axillary staging. Thirty-six patients have been followed for a median of 5.5 years (mean 65.2 months). Criteria for entry into the study were unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma, tumor size <2 cm, age >45 years, absence of extensive intraductal component, cavity size >3 cm in 1 dimension, node-negative, and final margins negative per National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project definition. A minimum balloon-to-skin surface distance of 5 mm was required. A dose of 34 Gy was delivered in 10 fractions over 5 days prescribed to 1 cm from the applicator surface using iridium-192 high-dose-rate brachytherapy. Data on infection, seromas, cosmetic outcome, and toxicities were collected at 3 and 6 months and at yearly intervals. Local recurrences, both true recurrences in the lumpectomy bed and failures outside the initially treated target volume (elsewhere failures), were recorded. Contralateral breast failure rates were noted. Results: The catheter was not implanted in 16 of the 70 enrolled patients due to cavity size not amenable to balloon placement (n = 10), ineligible by criteria (n = 4), and skin spacing (n = 2). Fifty-four patients were implanted and 43 were successfully treated with MammoSite balloon brachytherapy. Reasons for catheter explantation in 11 patients were poor cavity conformance in 7, inadequate skin spacing in 2, positive node in 1 and age less than 45 years in 1. Of the 43 patients who completed treatment, the infection rate was 9.3%. Seroma formation occurred in 32.6% of patients, of which 12% were symptomatic requiring aspiration. Asymptomatic fat necrosis was identified in 4 of the 43 patients, noted from time of catheter removal at 11, 14, 42, and 63 months. Good-excellent cosmetic outcomes were achieved in 83.3% of the 36 patients with more than 5 years of follow-up. Cosmetic outcomes were improved, with increased skin spacing having statistical significance at skin spacing >7 mm. The only serious adverse events were 2 infections: mastitis and abscess. Seven of the 43 treated patients have been discontinued from follow-up. None had a local recurrence recorded at last visit. Reasons for exit from the study were death from metastatic disease (n = 3), lost to follow-up (n = 2), and placed in hospice for other medical conditions (n = 2). No local recurrences (either at the tumor bed or elsewhere in the breast) or regional recurrences have occurred in the 36 patients who have been followed for a median of 5.5 years. No contralateral cancers have developed. Conclusions: MammoSite balloon brachytherapy as a sole modality for delivering radiation to the tumor bed has been successful in achieving excellent local control in this initial clinical study of patients with early-stage invasive ductal breast cancer. This has been achieved with minimal toxicities and good-excellent cosmetic outcomes in 83.3%. Accelerated partial breast irradiation using the MammoSite balloon in a carefully selected group of patients has demonstrated 5-year local recurrence results comparable to those achieved with conventional whole breast radiation therapy and interstitial catheter brachytherapy as reported at 5-year data points in studies of these treatment modalities. Poor cavity conformance and inadequate skin distance were the main factors limiting use of the MammoSite device. Extended follow-up will be required to determine the long-term efficacy of this treatment modality. © 2007 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.",,0

Methods: Twelve institutions are participating in this phase II clinical study. A total of 133 patients have been enrolled and 100 patients have successfully completed the prescribed radiation therapy. A dose of 34 Gy was delivered in 10 fractions over 5 days prescribed to 1 cm from the applicator surface using iridium-192 high-dose rate brachytherapy. Patients who met the following criteria were selected for enrollment into the study: age 45 years or older, unicentric pure DCIS, mammographic lesion of 3 cm or less, negative margins as defined by 1 mm or more, postoperative final gross pathologic size of tumor of 5 cm or less, clinically node negative, and a postlumpectomy mammogram showing the absence of any residual suspicious microcalcifications. The placement of the MammoSite catheter was performed either at the time of the lumpectomy or postlumpectomy. The minimum distance from the balloon surface to the surface of the skin is greater than 5 mm. Data collection points are at time of enrollment, time of implant, 3 months, 6 months, and then yearly at 1- to 5-year follow-up visits. Data collected are local control rates, cosmetic outcome using the Harvard Scale, toxicities, serious adverse events, disease-free survival, cause-specific survival, and contralateral breast failure. The Van Nuys Prognostic Index scores were calculated for each patient. Local recurrence is defined as either invasive or noninvasive recurrence within the target volume. Ipsilateral elsewhere recurrence is defined as either an invasive or noninvasive recurrence occurring outside of the target volume in the previously treated breast. This recurrence is classified as a new primary tumor. Results: The mean follow-up period was 9.5 months (range, 1-24 mo). The MammoSite catheter was explanted for the following reasons: inadequate skin distance (5.1%; 6 of 117), poor cavity conformance (5.1%; 6 of 117), positive margins (2.6%; 3 of 117), final histology (.85%; 1 of 117), and physician decision (.85%; 1 of 117). Of the patients in whom the MammoSite was explanted because of skin spacing or cavity conformance, 50% were at sites of new users (institutions that have placed fewer than 10 Mammosite catheters). Cosmetic results were rated as excellent in 63%, good in 35%, and fair in 2% in the 86 patients with a follow-up visit. Two patients were diagnosed with an ipsilateral local recurrence, 1 outside of the target volume and 1 true recurrence/marginal miss. One patient was diagnosed at 8 months and the other was diagnosed at 11 months. Both of these ipsilateral failures were DCIS. The Van Nuys Prognostic Index of these 2 patients was 9 and 8, respectively. Data collected showed the mean age at placement was 60.8 y, mean tumor size was 10.6 mm, mean actual closest surgical margin was 6.8 mm (range, .1-40 mm), a re-excision rate of 35%, postlumpectomy placement was 71%, and the mean skin-to-balloon surface distance was 13 mm with 89% >7 mm. No serious adverse events were reported. The infection rate was 4.0%. Conclusions: Accelerated partial breast irradiation delivered with the MammoSite balloon was clinically successful in patients entered into a phase II clinical study with pure DCIS, with results comparable with other studies reported in the literature that have evaluated use of the MammoSite balloon brachytherapy for delivery of radiation therapy in early breast cancers. Inadequate skin distance and poor cavity conformance were the main factors limiting the use of the MammoSite device. Cosmetic results were good to excellent in 98%. There have been 2 ipsilateral breast recurrences. © 2006 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.",,0

The examined tumour forms have varied and different detector systems and radiopharmaceuticals have also been used. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the ability of an NaI(T1) scintillation detector to detect primary tumours and metastases in patients with different endocrine tumour types (e.g. carcinoid tumours, endocrine pancreatic tumours and thyroid tumours) and in patients with breast carcinoma or benign thyroid lesions, on the basis of their somatostatin receptor expression after i.v. injection of 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide. Thirty patients were injected with 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide intravenously. Scintigraphic images were taken 1 day after injection of the radiopharmaceutical, and surgery was performed 1-7 days post injection. An NaI(T1) scintillation detector was used for intraoperative tumour detection. Tissue samples were collected during surgery for determination of 111In activity concentration and histopathological examination. The scintigraphic images were positive in 29 out of 30 patients. Intraoperative tumour detection was successful in 43 of 66 collected biopsies: 10 out of 11 for carcinoid tumours, 7 out of 10 for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and 14 out of 22 for breast cancer. On the basis of our findings we conclude that intraoperative tumour detection with 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide using this NaI(T1) detector can be successful especially for carcinoid tumours and endocrine pancreatic tumours, due to the relatively high activity concentrations in these tumour types, but is less successful in other forms of thyroid cancer, including MTC, and breast cancer.

Bezak,2010.0,Investigation of source position uncertainties & balloon deformation in MammoSite brachytherapy on treatment effectiveness,10.1007/s13246-010-0008-6,"The MammoSite breast high dose rate brachytherapy is used in treatment of early-stage breast cancer. The tumour bed volume is irradiated with high dose per fraction in a relatively small number of fractions. Uncertainties in the source positioning and MammoSite balloon deformation will alter the prescribed dose within the treated volume. They may also expose the normal tissues in balloon proximity to excessive dose. The purpose of this work is to explore the impact of these two uncertainties on the MammoSite dose distribution in the breast using dose volume histograms and Monte Carlo simulations. The Lyman-Kutcher and relative seriality models were employed to estimate the normal tissues complications associated with the MammoSite dose distributions. The tumour control probability was calculated using the Poisson model. This study gives low probabilities for developing heart and lung complications. The probability of complications of the skin and normal breast tissues depends on the location of the source inside the balloon and the volume receiving high dose. Incorrect source position and balloon deformation had significant effect on the prescribed dose within the treated volume. A 4 mm balloon deformation resulted in reduction of the tumour control probability by 24%. Monte Carlo calculations using EGSnrc showed that a deviation of the source by 1 mm caused approximately 7% dose reduction in the treated target volume at 1 cm from the balloon surface. In conclusion, accurate positioning of the (192)Ir source at the balloon centre and minimal balloon deformation are critical for proper dose delivery with the MammoSite brachytherapy applicator. On the basis of this study, we suggest that the MammoSite treatment protocols should allow for a balloon deformation of < or = 2 mm and a maximum source deviation of < or = 1 mm.",eng,0

It was developed to overcome the longer schedules associated with external-beam radiation therapy. It consists of a small balloon (4 cm in diameter) connected to an inflation channel and a catheter for the passage of a high dose rate 192Ir brachytherapy source. The device is placed into the tumor resection cavity and inflated with a mixture of saline and radiographic contrast agent to a size that fills the cavity. A high dose rate 192Ir source is driven into the balloon center using a remote afterloader to deliver the prescribed dose at a point 1 cm away from the balloon surface. There are several uncertainties that affect the dose distribution in the MammoSite brachytherapy. They include source position deviation, balloon deformation, and the concentration of the contrast medium inside the balloon. The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent of the dose perturbation for various concentrations of the contrast medium in a MammoSite balloon using Monte Carlo simulations and thermoluminescent dosimetry. This study also combines the impact of these uncertainties on the MammoSite treatment efficacy. The current study demonstrates that the combined uncertainties associated with the MammoSite brachytherapy technique--up to the value of 2 mm balloon deformation, 1 mm source deviation, and 15% contrast concentration--have no impact on the tumor control probability.",eng,0

Borg,2009.0,"Review of MammoSite brachytherapy: advantages, disadvantages and clinical outcomes",10.1080/02841860802537916,"BACKGROUND: The MammoSite radiotherapy system is an alternative treatment option for patients with early-stage breast cancer to overcome the longer schedules associated with external beam radiation therapy. The device is placed inside the breast surgical cavity and inflated with a combination of saline and radiographic contrast to completely fill the cavity. The treatment schedule for the MammoSite monotherapy is 34 Gy delivered in 10 fractions at 1.0 cm from the balloon surface with a minimum of 6 hours between fractions on the same day. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review article presents the advantages, disadvantages, uncertainties and clinical outcomes associated with the MammoSite brachytherapy (MSB). RESULTS: Potential advantages of MSB are: high localised dose with rapid falloff for normal tissue sparing, minimum delay between surgery and RT, catheter moves with breast, improved local control, no exposure to staff, likely side-effects reduction and potential cost/time saving (e.g. for country patients). The optimal cosmetic results depend on the balloon-to-skin distance. Good-to-excellent cosmetic results are achieved for patients with balloon-skin spacing of > or =7 mm. There have been very few published data regarding the long term tumour control and cosmesis associated with the MSB. The available data on the local control achieved with the MSB were comparable with other accelerated partial breast irradiation techniques. The contrast medium inside the balloon causes dose reduction at the prescription point. Current brachytherapy treatment planning systems (BTPS) do not take into account the increased photon attenuation due to high Z of contrast. Some BTPS predicted up to 10% higher dose near the balloon surface compared with Monte Carlo calculations using various contrast concentrations (5-25%). CONCLUSION: Initial clinical results have shown that the MammoSite device could be used as a sole radiation treatment for selected patients with early stage breast cancer providing good local control, minimal complication rate and excellent cosmesis.",eng,0

Widespread mammographic screening and effective systemic therapies have led to a stage shift at presentation and mortality reductions in the past two decades. Loco-regional control of the disease seems to affect long-term survival, and attention to surgical margins together with improved radiotherapy techniques could further contribute to mortality gains. Developments in oncoplastic surgery and partial-breast reconstruction have improved cosmetic outcomes after breast-conservation surgery. Optimum approaches for delivering chest-wall radiotherapy in the context of immediate breast reconstruction present special challenges. Accurate methods for intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes remain a clinical priority. Clinical trials are investigating combinatorial therapies that use novel agents targeting growth factor receptors, signal transduction pathways, and tumour angiogenesis. Gene-expression profiling offers the potential to provide accurate prognostic and predictive information, with selection of best possible therapy for individuals and avoidance of overtreatment and undertreatment of patients with conventional chemotherapy. Short-term presurgical studies in the neoadjuvant setting allow monitoring of proliferative indices, and changes in gene-expression patterns can be predictive of response to therapies and long-term outcome.",eng,0

Methods and materials: The study consisted of 11 patients who had the MS catheter placed and who were subsequently not treated due to inadequate skin distance. A phantom scan of the CP multicatheter hybrid device was superimposed on the MS CT scan and a dosimetric comparison was performed. Results: The median MS balloon size, diameter, and minimum skin distance were 40 cc, 4.1 cm, and 5 mm, respectively. The D<inf>90</inf>, V<inf>100</inf>, V<inf>150</inf>, and V<inf>200</inf> with MS vs. CP were 95.29% vs. 97.06%, 88.8% vs. 91.3%, 35.7% vs. 38.0%, and 9.4% vs. 9.6%, respectively. The median maximum skin dose was 5.5 Gy vs. 3.9 Gy (p <.0001). The median dose homogeneity index (DHI) was 0.60 vs. 0.59 (p = .09). The median maximum rib, heart, and lung dose were 2.17 Gy vs. 2.18 Gy, 2.17 Gy vs. 2.18 Gy, and 0.50 Gy vs. 0.56 Gy, respectively. Conclusion: The hybrid CP catheter reduced the skin dose significantly without compromising the planning target volume coverage, DHI, or dose to other critical organs.

Monga,2003.0,Intraoperative mapping of renal lymphatic drainage: technique and application in a porcine model,10.1089/089277903765444375,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The use of lymphadenectomy in renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) is controversial. Proponents argue that lymphadenectomy improves survival, whereas opponents challenge the procedure on the basis of its morbidity and the variable lymphatic drainage of the kidney. Intraoperative gamma probes have been used to guide resection of radiolabeled sentinel nodes in cancers of the breast, penis, and head and neck and in melanoma. Our goal in applying this technique to RCC is to improve detection and to limit sampling of lymph nodes during lymphadenectomy. This preliminary study in a porcine model evaluated the feasibility and transit time of radiolabeled tracer injected into the kidney. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected on four 40-kg Yorkshire pigs. The right kidney was exposed through a flank incision. Using both blue dye and technetium-99m, mapping and resection of the sentinel lymph nodes was performed with the assistance of an intraoperative gamma probe (Neoprobe). Remote cervical lymph nodes were utilized as controls. Vascular counts along the carotid vessels were obtained to confirm that the radioisotope was not being dispersed systemically. RESULTS: Within 10 minutes of renal injection of the tracer, excised sentinel lymph nodes demonstrated significant radioactive counts compared with controls. Vascular counts confirmed that radioisotope tracer did not enter the venous circulation. CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel lymph node sampling using a gamma probe and blue dye appears to be feasible in the porcine kidney. Further studies using this technique in humans will evaluate the impact of selective lymphadenectomy on survival in RCC.",eng,0

Indeed there remain a number of grey zones with respect to the optimization of the extent and the timing of surgery and radiation therapy (RT) in this patient population, also in consideration of the significant heterogeneity in biological behaviour and response to treatment identified for these tumours.

Ghorbel,2007.0,[Breast cancer in men],10.1016/j.lpm.2007.03.033,"Breast cancer in men is rare and most often occurs at or after the age of 60 years. Prognosis is poor when it is discovered at a late stage, as it often is in men, although it should be easier to detect because men have so little breast tissue. The causal mechanism appears to depend on hormone metabolism abnormalities related to elevated estrogen or prolactin levels. A family history of breast cancer is found in 5-10% of cases. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma accounts for most cases (70-90%) of male breast cancers. In situ but not invasive carcinoma is exclusively ductal and accounts for 7% of cases. Spread to lymph nodes is observed in 50-75% of cases. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that tumors are positive for progesterone and estrogen receptors more frequently in men than women. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination, ultrasonography, and mammography. Aspiration cytology often makes it possible to confirm the malignancy. Excisional biopsy with an immediate intraoperative pathology examination confirms malignancy and makes wider excision possible during the same procedure. A modified radical mastectomy with removal of some lymph nodes (Patey's mastectomy) is the standard basic treatment. Locoregional radiotherapy is very often indicated. Hormone therapy is also a first-line treatment. Chemotherapy is reserved for young men with substantial lymph node invasion and negative for hormonal receptors. The prognosis of breast cancer in men remains uncertain because of the frequently late diagnosis, unpredictable course, and high potential for metastasis.",fre,0

Materials/Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively collected dataset of early-stage breast cancer patients treated between 2007 and 2012 was performed to evaluate the early toxicities related to IORT as compared to BCHDRB. Seventy-eight patients were treated with IORT and 15 patients were treated with BCHDRB. The prescribed dose for IORT patients was 20 Gy to the surface of the applicator with the radius of the applicator varying from 3.5 to 5.0 cm. The dose at 1 cm from the applicator varied from 5 to 7 Gy. BCHDRB patients received a total dose of 34 Gy delivered with twice-daily fractionation over 5 days. The cavity size varied between 30 to 50 cc. The dose was prescribed to 1.0 cm from the surface of the cavity. The median followup time for the IORT group was 12.5 months and that for the BCHDRB group was 36 months. Toxicities were evaluated using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) toxicity scoring system based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Advanced Events version 3.0; posttreatment cosmesis was assessed using the Harvard breast cosmesis score. Results: Early postoperative seromas (grades I and II) developed in 26 (32.5%) patients in the IORT group with a majority of the seromas being asymptomatic and resolving in 4 to 6 months. Four (5%) of the patients required a single aspiration for symptomatic seroma. Of the BCHDRB group 5 (33%) patients developed seromas (grades I and II). Symptomatic seroma was observed in 2 (13.3%) patients and 1 patient required a single aspiration. Other observed toxicities in the IORT and BCHDRB groups, respectively, were as follows: dermatitis, 4 patients (5.1%) and 2 patients (13.3%); fibrosis, 1 patient (1%) and 3 patients (20.0%); and breast infection, 4 patients (5.0%) and 2 patients (13.3%). In the IORT group, breast cellulitis was managed by antibiotics in 3 (4%) patients. In the BCHDRB group, fat necrosis occurred in 2 (13.3%) patients. In the IORT group, at the12-month follow-up, 92% of patients had excellent or good cosmesis and 8% of patients had fair or poor cosmesis. In the BCHDRB group, at 26 months of follow-up 83% of patients had excellent or good cosmesis and 17% had fair or poor cosmesis. Conclusions: IORT has been shown to be an equivalent treatment in earlystage breast cancer as whole-breast irradiation. The benefits of IORT include a shorter treatment time, less dermatitis, fewer infections, and improved cosmesis over BCHDRB.",,0

Our hypothesis was that inter-fraction seroma collection around the balloon surface would have an adverse effect on dosimetry of the target. Material and methods: This is a dosimetric re-planning study using two volumetric models (30 cc and 45 cc) in a Contura multi-lumen balloon (MLB) catheter. In a previously treated patient, two customized baseline plans were ge nerated using multiple channels of the Contura catheter prescribed to the Planning Target Volume Evaluation (PTV-Eval). Symmetric expansions of 1.0 mm (0-9 mm) increments around the balloon surface were performed to simulate a Virtual Seroma"" (VS) accumulation for both balloon volumes and plans were obtained for each expansion using Eclipse BrachyvisionTM. An analysis of these plans was then performed to evaluate the effect of seroma accumulation on dosimetric parameters of V100 and V90. Results: 20 plans were generated and analyzed (10 plans for each balloon volume), representing VS of 6.0-66.0 cc. There was a commensurate decrease in the dose delivered to the PTV-Eval V100 and V90 (as defined by the original treatment plan) with increasing VS accumulation leading to a sub-optimal coverage of the PTV-Eval. For 30 cc MLB catheter, V100 decreased by 1.4% and V90 decreased by 0.9% for every 1 cc of VS. For 45cc MLB catheter, V100 decreased by 1.3% and V90 decreased by 1.15% for every 1.0 cc accumulation of VS. Conclusions: Balloon catheter-tissue adherence ensures daily dose delivery to the planned PTV-Eval. Accumulation of seroma, hematoma or air between HDR fractions can significantly impact PTV-Eval dosimetry. Vacuum-port aspiration prior to delivery of each fraction, if available, should be considered to minimize the risk of geographic under dosing.""",,0

Methods and Materials: This is a dosimetric replanning study on 10 patients with evidence of seroma collection at time of initial computed tomographic simulation around the catheter. Total dose was 34 Gy given at 3.4 Gy twice a day over 5 treatment days. A total of 20 plans were generated, 10 plans without accounting for and 10 after subtracting the seroma.

Our goal was to evaluate the effect of inter-fraction seroma collection around the balloon surface on the dosimetry of the target (PTV-Eval) which signifies the at risk lumpectomy cavity target volume. Materials and Methods: This is a dosimetric replanning study using two volumes (30 cc and 45 cc) in a ConturaTM (SenoRx, Inc., Irvine, CA) multi-lumen balloon (MLB) catheter. A customized plan was first generated using the peripheral 4 of the 5 channels of the ConturaTM catheter giving a 10-mm margin to define the PTV-Eval (minus skin and chestwall per current RTOG guidelines). Uniform balloon expansion of 1 mm increments around the balloon surface was performed to simulate a theoretical and symmetrical ''virtual seroma'' (VS) accumulation. The volume (in cc) of this expansion was calculated to estimate each VS. New individualized plans were then generated for each 1 mm increment, representing additional accumulating VS. PTV-Eval dosimetry was analyzed independently for each VS volume. Dosimetric plans were generated using Eclipse BrachyvisionTM (Varian Medical Systems, lnc., Palo Alto, CA) comparing the change in volumetric and dosimetric coverage of the initially defined PTV-Eval. Results: A total of 20 plans were generated and analyzed for this study (10 plans for each balloon volume), representing VS volumes of 6.0-66.0 cc. For each simulated plan, there was a commensurate decrease in the dose delivered to the PTV-Eval V100 (as defined by the original treatment plan) with increasing VS accumulation. For the 30cc MLB catheter, the V100 decreased by 1.4% for every 1 cc accumulation of VS (Range=7-10% for every 5-7 cc). For the 45cc MLB catheter, the the V100 decreased by 1.3% for every 1 cc accumulation of VS (Range=7-11% for every 5-10 cc). For each theoretical plan, VS accumulation translated into a sub-optimal coverage of the PTV-Eval. Conclusions: ln breast brachytherapy, balloon catheter-tissue adherence ensures accuracy of the PTV-Eval V100. The clinical significance of inter-fraction seroma development is unclear since studies to date have shown very low local recurrence rates without accounting for any seroma collection. Even so, vacuum-port aspiration prior to each fraction, if available, should be considered to minimize the potential risk of geographical underdosing.",,0

Currently, breast cancer tumor margins are examined in a pathology lab either while the patient is anesthetized or after the surgical procedure has been terminated. These current methods often result in cancer cells present at the surgical resection margin due to inadequate margin assessment at the point of care. Due to such limitations evident in current diagnoses, tools for increasing the accuracy and speed of tumor margin detection directly in the operating room are still needed. We are exploring the potential of using a nano-biophotonics system to facilitate intraoperative tumor margin assessment ex vivo at the cellular level. By combining bioconjugated silica-based gold nanoshells, which scatter light in the near-infrared, with a portable FDA-approved reflectance confocal microscope, we first validate the use of gold nanoshells as effective reflectance-based imaging probes by evaluating the contrast enhancement of three different HER2-overexpressing cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to detect HER2-overexpressing cells in human tissue sections within 5 min of incubation time. This work supports the use of targeted silica-based gold nanoshells as potential real-time molecular probes for HER2-overexpression in human tissue.",eng,0

METHODS: A retrospective analysis on 1339 patients treated for breast cancer with breast conserving-surgery and radiotherapy at a single Institution between 2000 and 2009 was performed. RESULTS: During primary surgery 526 patients (39.3%) underwent intraoperative re-excision. At the final pathological report, the margins were positive in 132 patients (9.9%) and close in 85 (6.3%). To obtain clear margins, 142 of these women underwent a second surgery; 35 patients with positive margins (27%) and 40 with close margins (47%) did not receive additional surgery because of different reasons (patients refusal, old age, comorbidity or for focal margin involvement). At second surgery, residual disease was found in 62.9% of patients with positive margins and in 55.5% of those with close margins. At a median follow-up time of 4 years, local recurrence (LR) rate was 2.9% for patients with clear margins, 5.2% (p = 0.67) for patients with unresected close margins and 11.7% (p = 0.003) for those with unresected positive margins. The HER-2 and the basal-like subtypes had the higher rate of LR and the luminal A the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly higher LR rate was found only among patients with positive margins not receiving additional surgery, but not in those with unresected close margins. Positive margins are a strong predictor for LR and need re-excision that can be avoided for close margins.",eng,0

Preliminary results,", ","Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) combines a skin-sparing mastectomy with preservation of the Nipple Areola Complex (NAC), intraoperative pathological assessment of the nipple tissue core, and immediate reconstruction, thereby permitting better cosmesis for patients undergoing total mastectomy. Radiotherapy of the NAC was carried out in every single patient after surgery. The procedure was first performed on selected patients following a clinical research protocol. From January 2003 to June 2004, 10 patients underwent nipple sparing mastectomy followed by reconstruction (4 of them decided also to undergo a prophylactic mastectomy on the other breast) at the Breast Unit, Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia, Italy. Patients had been accurately selected before the operation following some criteria previously assessed by a team of specialists including the breast surgeon, the oncological physician, the radiotherapist and the plastic surgeon. Histology of the 10 NSMs confirmed invasive carcinoma in 3 cases and in situ carcinoma in the remainder. Superficial necrosis of the NAC that settled down spontaneously without consequences occurred in 2 cases; loss of sensitivity of the NAC in 4 patients; 1 patient developed haematoma. No asymmetry was reported. All women were clear of cancer after the treatment. Nipple-sparing mastectomy is the procedure of choice on selected patients.",eng,0

Chojniak,2009.0,New applications of radioguided surgery in oncology,", ","OBJECTIVE: To report oncological cases (excluding those related to breast cancer) for which radioguided surgery has been used in combination with the Radioguided Occult Lesion Localization technique. INTRODUCTION: Radioguided surgery enables a surgeon to identify lesions or tissues that have been preoperatively marked with radioactive substances. The Radioguided Occult Lesion Localization technique has been widely used to identify the sentinel lymph node and occult lesions in patients with breast cancer. However, few studies have reported the use of this technique for non-breast cancer pathologies. METHODOLOGY: In all cases, injection of Technecium-99m sulfur colloid was performed, directly inside or near by the suspicious lesion, guided by ultrasound or computed tomography, up to 36 hours prior to the surgical procedure. Intraoperative lesion detection was carried out using a gamma-probe. RESULTS: We report five oncology cases in which preoperative markings of the lesions were carried out using the Radioguided Occult Lesion Localization technique. The patients presented with the following: recurrence of renal cell carcinoma, cervical recurrence of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, recurrence of retroperitoneal sarcoma, lesions of the popliteal fossa, and recurrence of rhabdomyosarcoma of a thigh. In each case, the lesions that were marked preoperatively were ultimately successfully excised. CONCLUSIONS: Radioguided surgery has proven to be a safe and effective alternative for the management of oncology patients. The Radioguided Occult Lesion Localization technique can be useful in selected cases where suspect lesions may be difficult to identify intraoperatively, due to their dimensions or anatomical location. The procedure allows for more conservative excisions and reduces the surgery-related morbidity.",eng,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patient information was retrospectively reviewed and survey data were prospectively collected for women treated between 2004 to 2014 (APBI) and 2012 to 2014 (WBRT). Criteria for APBI treatments were ER+ (after 2010), N0 (after 2010), T < 3 cm, and post-menopausal. All patients were given a survey with modified FACIT (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy) breast quality of life questions to rate their amount of pain, self-consciousness, low energy, presence of lymphedema, and breast cosmesis. RESULTS: 242 APBI patients and 59 WBRT patients were identified. In the WBRT cohort, 34 women met departmental criteria for APBI treatment (WBRT who were APBI eligible). The FACIT survey was completed by 80 women treated with APBI (33%; mean follow-up time of 14 months), and 26 women treated with WBRT who were APBI eligible (76%; mean follow-up time of 26 months). During the first year post-treatment, low energy (p = 0.009), self-consciousness (p = 0.0004), and lymphedema (p = 0.0002) scores were significantly lower in the APBI cohort when compared to women treated with WBRT who were APBI eligible. During the second year post-treatment, women treated with APBI reported significantly better breast cosmesis (p = 0.04). The single-lumen balloon (score = 6.3/10) was found to be associated with worse cosmesis compared to the multi-lumen balloons (Mammosite ML and Contura; score = 8.2/10; p = 0.002). There were no significant differences in rates of recurrence between balloons or treatments (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: APBI treated patients reported higher cosmetic satisfaction than patients in the matched WBRT cohort. Quality of life scores tended to improve over time. Multi-lumen catheters provided superior cosmetic results compared to single-lumen catheters.",eng,0

Ollila,2009.0,Attaining negative margins in breast-conservation operations: is there a consensus among breast surgeons?,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2009.07.026,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this survey was to ascertain the most common surgical practices for attaining negative (tumor-free) surgical margins in patients desiring breast-conservation treatment for breast cancer to see if a consensus exists for optimal treatment of patients. STUDY DESIGN: We sent a survey to 1,000 surgeons interested in the treatment of breast cancer. Three hundred eighty-one surgeons responded to this survey and 351 were used for the analysis (response rate of 38%). RESULTS: Answers showed a large variety in clinical practices among breast surgeons across the country. There was little intraoperative margin analysis; only 48% of surgeons examine the margins grossly with a pathologist and even fewer used frozen sections or imprint cytology. Decisions to reexcise specific margins varied greatly. For example, 57% of surgeons would never reexcise for a positive deep margin, but 53% would always reexcise for a positive anterior margin. Most importantly, there was a large range in answers about acceptable margins with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma. Fifteen percent of surgeons would accept any negative margin, 28% would accept a 1-mm negative margin, 50% would accept a 2-mm negative margin, 12% would accept a 5-mm negative margin, and 3% would accept a 10-mm negative margin. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in breast-conservation treatment.",eng,0

Systemic therapy was provided according to the St. Gallen consensus. Patients were recalled every 6-12 months for follow-up. Findings were scored according to the LENT-SOMA scale. Results: Median age was 61.8 (range 30-84) years, and median follow-up was 37 (range 5-91) months. There were T1, T2, and Tx tumors in 129, 67, and 1 patients, respectively, and N0, N1, N2, and N3 disease in 144, 36, 15, and 2 patients, respectively. Until December 2009, 5 local invasive relapses, 1 local ductal carcinoma-in-situ, 1 axillary relapse, 6 secondary cancers, and 11 distant metastases were seen, resulting in a 5-year disease-free survival of 81.0% and an overall survival of 91.3%. Local relapse-free survival (invasive cancers) at 3 and 5 years was 97.0%. After a follow-up of 5 years (n = 58), only 8 patients (13.8%) had chronic skin toxicities, and 2 patients (3.4%) had a marked increase in density (fibrosis III), while 62.0% had no/barely palpable fibrosis 0-I.

Material and Methods: 91 patients were followed up for a median of 24 months (range 21-29 months) after IORT and EBRT. Twenty Gy IORT were given with 50 kV X-rays (INTRABEAM, Carl Zeiss Surgical, Oberkochen, Germany) followed by 46-50 Gy EBRT after a median interval of 37 days (range, 13-226 days).

To conform to recommendations regarding the treatment of breast cancer, an estimation of costs and personnel to assure treatment is required. To date no recommendations based on real time measurements are available. The DEGRO (German Society of Radiation Oncology), therefore, initiated a prospective multicenter evaluation of core procedures of radiotherapy. In this analysis, the results regarding human resources and room occupation during the treatment of breast cancer are presented. Patients and methods. Three academic radiation oncology centers (Erlangen, Munster, Mannheim) prospectively documented their workflow and working time for all breast cancer patients from July-October 2008. Subsequently, a statistical analysis was performed. Results. The longest working time of physicians was the definition of the target volume and organs at risk (mean 33 min). Furthermore, physicians needed much time for general tasks, which included conversations. Physicists needed the most time for treatment planning and authorization (64 min), whereas technicians were mostly needed in day-to-day radiotherapy treatment (15 min, 31 min including verification). Despite significant differences in specific steps between centers, overall working times and room occupation were comparable and representative. Special procedures (intraoperative radiotherapy/multicatheter brachytherapy) required considerable amounts of additional working time of physicians and physicists. Conclusion. In this prospective analysis, data of human resources and room occupation during treatment of breast cancer are presented for the first time. Each patient consumes about 12 h of human resources for treatment and 3.75 h for general tasks (physicians 4.7 h, physicists 1.8 h, and technicians 9.2 h). © Springer-Verlag 2012.",,0

The indication, rationale and possible advantages have been published in 2011 [2]. In the first clinical period several technical improvements and modifications could stabilize the method, its clinical feasibility and shortterm safety has been shown [3]. Due to the higher local radiation doses compared to extracorporal radiotherapy (EBRT) permitted by the steep dose fall off of the IORT-source a higher local tumor control can potentially be achieved by Kypho-IORT. In this study we present an intermediate prospective follow-up of 9-month after Kypho-IORT. PURPOSE: Local tumor control and clinical use of Kypho-IORT. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Evidence level IV: prospective case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: 62 patients suffering from 77 spinal metastases which were treated with Kypho-IORT were included in the prospective study. Data of 16 patients who finished the 4th follow-up appointment after around 9 months and were interpreted. OUTCOME MEASURES: Acquired basic data were gender, age at surgery, tumor entity, treated vertebral level, delivered dose. Prospective collected data were pain measure by visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperative and at follow-up, Karnofsky Index, local metastasis control in the treated vertebra and general progression of metastases by CT or MRI. METHODS: Clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations. RESULTS: 16 patients (12 females, 4 males) with an average age of 61 years were included. Twelve patients had breast cancer, two patients suffered prostate cancer and one each with lung, ovarian and sigmoid cancer. Thirteen thoracic and 4 lumbar vertebrae were treated with an average surgical time of 70 minutes per vertebra. The time from surgery to the 9-month follow-up was in average 348 days. The Karnofsky index was constant with 87 preoperative versus 86 at follow-up. The VAS average decreased from 4.1 preoperative to 1.4 postoperative and 0.8 at follow-up. In all cases but two, a dose of 8gy in a radius of 5mm was delivered successfully, two cases with second dose level at 8gy in 8mm distance to isocenter. Three patients had a local progress, one patient due to incorrect indication. Two vertebrae needed open revision surgery; one local progress was treated only with EBRT. Eight patients showed a general tumor progress. CONCLUSIONS: Kypho-IORT can offer a fast postoperative pain reduction, immediate stabilization and prevention of secondary fractures in the treated vertebrae by kyphoplasty which could be confirmed in this small cohort. The VAS decreased postoperative and this level was maintained during follow-up. Local tumor control (indication failures ignored) by intraoperative radiation could be achieved in 87% of the vertebrae over the 9 months period, which seems to be better than single fraction radiation schedules and at least comparable to multiple fraction schedules of conventional radiation. Furthermore the Karnofsky-Index stayed constant over the follow-up period which proves the low morbidity of the intervention in short and in intermediate term. All 14 of 16 patients of the 9-month-follow- up were treated with the lowest calculated treatment dose; probably an even higher local tumor control is achievable by higher local radiation doses.These results warrant further evaluation of this technique by a dose escalation and a multicenter study, which is currently under way.",,0

This rises the probability to suffer from metastases. Vertebral body metastases are a major cause for immobility and hospitalisation of palliative patients. Actual treatment modalities like EBRT (fractionated 20x2gy or 10x3gy) or aggressive operative techniques like the dorso-ventral stabilization do not respect the treatment aim of quality of life and a short hospitalisation. The combination of intra-operative single-dose radiotherapy with kyphoplasty (Kypho-IORT) is thought to allow local tumor control and immediate pain relief due to the cement augementation. The first publication of this novel treatmentoption was done in 2010(1), meanwhile additional publications on the technical feasibility (2), the underlying physics and possible treatment strategies (3) were issued. Like in every new procedure no longterm-results are available. In this study we could follow-up 10 patients having received Kypho-IORT ad least 6 months ago. Material and Methods: Kypho-IORT has been performed successfully in 39 patients, 10 of them reached the 6month Follow-up (6M-FU). In addition to that 3 more patients were intended for treatment with Kypho-IORT, but could not be treated due to technical difficulties. After changing the operationtechnique no problems occurred in every following case (20). We treated 47 vertebrae in 39 patients. 12 patients died because of general tumour progress before 6M-FU, 1 died of an severe, not operation-related, urosepsis. 3 patients were housed in a hospice and droped out. 7 patients were treated less then 6 month ago, 1 case is address unknown. In 5 patients the 6M-FU is actually pending. Results: In 7 cases the primary entity consists of breast-cancer, in each one case of ovarian-, lung- and prostate-cancer. The preoperative pain-level of 4.7 (VAS) could be reduced to 1.7. At 6M-FU the mean VAS was 0.5. No local progress could be observed, general tumor progress was found in 5 patients at 6MFU, 2 of these died in further course. The mobility of the treated patients could be sustained. Conclusion: Kypho-IORT seems to achieve local tumor control due to single-dose radiation and to provide instant pain-reduction by cement-stabilisation with minimal hospitalisation of palliative patients. The above mentioned treatment goals appear to be in reach.",,0

Nevertheless, all these objectives can be hampered if improper surgical and radiation techniques are used. The aim of this report is to underline the surgical tips that, in our experience, must be fulfilled systematically to obtain the best results with breast IORT. Materials: In our practice, surgical principles in breast IORT include: resection of the tumor before radiation, metilene blue marking of the resection margins (figure 1), protection of the chest structures using aluminium round protectors (figure 2), purse string suture of the resection margins in order to include the risk area in the radiation field (figure 3), checking this inclusion (facilitated by metilene blue markings) after fixing the bolus (figure 4), using as wider applicators as possible and protecting skin wedges with moistened swabs (figure 5). Results: From November 2008 to November 2010, 12 breast lORTs had been performed in our center. The local recurrence rate has been 0% after a mean follow up of 29 (1-24) months. Aesthetic radiation side effects have been mild, as none of our patients have been referred to plastic surgery. Radiation schedule (compared to ERT) has been reduced in all cases. Conclusions: Metilene blue marking of the resection margins altogether with meticulous surgical and radiation techniques may help to achive breast IORT advantages.",,0

Recently, a cohort of breast cancer patients was left with tungsten in their breasts following testing of a tungsten-based shield during intraoperative radiotherapy. While monitoring tungsten levels in the blood and urine of these patients, we utilized the 66Cl4 cell model, in vitro and in mice to study the effects of tungsten exposure on mammary tumor growth and metastasis. We still detect tungsten in the urine of patients' years after surgery (mean urinary tungsten concentration at least 20 months post-surgery = 1.76 ng/ml), even in those who have opted for mastectomy, indicating that tungsten does not remain in the breast. In addition, standard chelation therapy was ineffective at mobilizing tungsten. In the mouse model, tungsten slightly delayed primary tumor growth, but significantly enhanced lung metastasis. In vitro, tungsten did not enhance 66Cl4 proliferation or invasion, suggesting that tungsten was not directly acting on 66Cl4 primary tumor cells to enhance invasion. In contrast, tungsten changed the tumor microenvironment, enhancing parameters known to be important for cell invasion and metastasis including activated fibroblasts, matrix metalloproteinases, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We show, for the first time, that tungsten enhances metastasis in an animal model of breast cancer by targeting the microenvironment. Importantly, all these tumor microenvironmental changes are associated with a poor prognosis in humans.",eng,0

Recently, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has been introduced to replace external beam wholebreast irradiation (EBRT), either for boost or single dose (in some low-risk patients) purposes. In this study, we reported early experience using intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT, a type of APBI) in the treatment of early breast cancer. Methods. Immediately after tumour removal, IORT using Mobetron delivering electrons with dose of 9 Gy (boost) or 21 Gy (single dose) at the level of 90% isodose was used. All patients in the boost group received postoperative EBRT (50 Gy). Toxicity was evaluated by NCI/CTCAE V4.0 and RTOG acute radiation morbidity score. Cosmetic outcome was evaluated by physical examination. Quality of life (QoL) was recorded using the EORTC QLQ-C30/BR23 and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B). Local recurrence and disease-free survival were recorded. Results. There were 20 and 17 patients receiving 9 Gy and 21 Gy IORT. Median follow-up was 16 and 3.5 months in the boost and the single dose groups. Success rate of IORT was 92.5%. None in both groups had local recurrence or distant metastasis. In the boost group, one patient had grade 3 skin induration and one had wound separation. One patient had grade 3 RTOG lung toxicity (likely due to EBRT). In the single dose group, all were well tolerated with no grade 3 or 4 acute and late toxicity. Regarding cosmetic issues, most patients had a good outcome (61.5% in the boost group and 80% in the single dose group). All had good QoL, in which functional scores were high and symptom scale score were low. Discussion. IORT using electron as a boost and single dose APBI provided highly feasibility, acceptable toxicity, good cosmetic outcome, and excellent QoL. Further follow-up is required to assess long-term toxicity and local recurrence.",,0

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) operation is commonly used in the evaluation of female breast cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether SLN operation is as feasible and accurate in male patients compared with female patients. STUDY DESIGN: Between 1999 and 2005, 30 men and 2,784 women underwent SLN operation. Clinical and pathologic data were reviewed and statistical analysis performed. RESULTS: Men presented at an older age (p = 0.005) and with larger tumors than women (p = 0.04). The SLN was identified in 100% of men and in 98.3% of women (p = NS). The mean number of SLNs harvested was 3.5 in men and 3.0 in women (p = NS). The incidence of positive SLNs was higher in men (37.0% versus 22.3%), although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1). In patients with a positive SLN there were additional non-SLNs positive in 62.5% of men, compared with 20.7% in women (p = 0.01). The median size of the largest lymph node metastasis was 10 mm in men and 3 mm in women (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: SLN operation in clinically node-negative men is feasible and accurate. Male breast cancer patients present at an older age and with larger tumors than female breast cancer patients. Male patients have higher nodal tumor burden reflected in a larger size of nodal metastasis and increased risk of harboring additional disease in axillary lymph nodes when the SLN is positive. Intraoperative SLN evaluation should be considered in the surgical management of male breast cancer.",eng,0

Local control efficacy of 3D-conformal APBI compared to whole breast irradiation is currently investigated through large clinical trials. Different irradiation modalities have been reported: brachytherapy, intraoperative irradiation (IORT), 3D-conformal APBI and others. Brachytherapy has been used the longest with the most extensive follow up. This technique is very conformal and well tolerated, generally used intraoperative with a clear visualization to the surgical cavity. The long term toxicity is also well-documented. Even though brachytherapy is usually considered as the gold standard"", 3Dconformal APBI is one of the most used APBI technique owing to its facilities and its generalization through many phase II and III clinical trials. Here, we will defend advantages of APBI techniques which do not use brachytherapy and show that brachytherapy is only one system among all techniques of radiotherapy to deliver APBI.""",,0

A French pilot phase II study],10.1016/j.canrad.2010.05.006,"PURPOSE: Since 2009, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in North America has been allowed to be used for selected group of patients outside a clinical trial according to the ASTRO consensus statement. In France, accelerated partial breast irradiation is still considered investigational, several clinical trials have been conducted using either intraoperative (Montpellier) or Mammosite((R)) (Lille) or brachytherapy modality (PAC GERICO/FNCLCC). Here, we report the original dosimetric results of this technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since October 2007, Institut Gustave-Roussy has initiated a phase II trial using 3D-conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation (40 Gy in 10 fractions BID in 1 week). Twenty-five patients with pT1N0 breast cancer were enrolled and were treated by two minitangent photons beams (6MV) and an en face"" electron beam (6-22 MeV). RESULTS: The mean clinical target volume and planning target volume were respectively 15.1cm(3) (range: 5.2-28.7 cm(3)) and 117 cm(3) (range: 52-185 cm(3)). The planning target volume coverage was adequate with at least a mean of 99% of the volume encompassed by the isodose 40 Gy. The mean dose to the planning target volume was 41.8 Gy (range: 41-42.4 Gy). Dose inhomogeneity did not exceed 5%. Mean doses to the ipsilateral lung and heart were 1.6 Gy (range: 1.0-2.3 Gy) and 1.2 Gy (range: 1.0-1.6 Gy), respectively. CONCLUSION: The 3D conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation using two minitangent and ""en face"" electron beams using a total dose of 40 Gy in 10 fractions BID over 5 days achieves appropriate planning target volume coverage and offers significant normal-tissue sparing (heart, lung).

However, there is currently no planning system associated with these devices, which precludes patient-specific dose delivery optimization. The objective of this study was the development and validation of a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS)-based dosimetry platform using the Intrabeam system. METHODS: After surgical resection of the tumor this system delivers a single dose fraction at the surface of an applicator irradiating the tumor bed through a 50 kV x-ray beam. The GATE MCS platform was used in this study combining the phase space obtained by modeling the x-ray source and the detailed modeling of the additional parts of the Intrabeam system. The model was validated by comparing simulated versus experimental measurements of depth dose curves (DDC) and isotropy. A clinical validation study was also carried out using patient computed tomography images. RESULTS: The mean deviation between measured and simulated DDC was 2.9% +/- 4.4% and 5.9% +/- 5.7% for the bare needle and the use of applicators, respectively. A good agreement with experimental measurements was also found in terms of dose isotropy with a maximum difference of 2.04% for the 40 mm diameter applicator. A patient study revealed a mean absolute deviation of 0.06 Gy between simulated and thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) measured skin doses. CONCLUSION: This study shows the potential of using the GATE MCS platform to model three-dimensional dose distributions of the Intrabeam system for use in IORT.",eng,0

The aim of our study is to model the INTRABEAM system with applicator needle"" dedicated to the application of kypho-IORT and verify and validate the doses actually received for such treatment. A first step is to calibrate the model with the applicator needle with simple simulations in a water tank. In a second step, a simulation of clinical treatment is performed on an anthropomorphic phantom RANDO and dose measurements are collected from thermoluminescent detectors placed on the skin and inside the phantom around the X-ray source. Finally, dose calculations are performed on the platform Monte Carlo GATE by integrating CT images of the phantom with the applicator integrated in the phantom. The validation is performed by comparing simulations and experimental measurements on the phantom. The first simulation results show a good fit with the experimental measurements and confirm with personalized study on CT images of the phantom. The mean relative deviation between experimental measurements and calculated doses is 1% (Min: 0.2% High: 7.5%) with a maximum uncertainty of 0.3% in GATE.

Whereas often a geographic miss in covering the boost target occurs with external beam boost radiotherapy, the purpose of IORT is to cover the tumor bed safely. The aim of the study was analysis of therapy effects, acute and late toxicity, cosmetic effect of the breast and analysis of the quality of live questionnaires made by the patients. Materials: This report include 30 patients with breast cancer in stage T1-2NO-lA treated with conserving surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy using the Mobetron. The intraoperatively delivered dose after tumor resection was lOGy prescribe to the applicator surface using 4-12 MV electrons ( in 66,7% it was 6 MV energy ). We use wedg e to the chest wall and collimator With 0-30degree angle. In 12 patients (40%) we also use 0,5-1cm bolus. Median of the dose dept was 2cm. In all cases IORT was followed by external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with total dose of 50Gy in 2 Gy fractions. EBRT was delivered with standard two-tangential-field technique using linear accel erators with 6 MV photons. During 12 months observation in 1, 6 and 12 month every patient was physical exanimate with photos of the breast. Acute side effects were scored according to lhe EORTC scale and late toxicity according to the Lent-Soma classificaton. Every patient made also the qualityoflive questionnaires ( QLQ-C3O and QLQ BR23) during observation. Six months after EBRT mammography with uttrasounds of the breast was made in all patients. Results: No local recurrence occurred during 12 months observation. The IORT combi nation with EBRT was well tolerated, with no Grade 3 and 4 skin acute and late toxicities. Acute reactions in Grade 1 and 2 of the skin were observed in 20% of patients. The cosmetic outcome was good to excellent in 80% of patients after 12 months. In quality of live questionnaires after 1, 6 and 12 months of observation 86,7% of patients evaluated the effect of the therapy as good and very good. Pain in the breast and more sensitivity of the skin estimated 33% of patient after 1, 6 and 12 months. Edema of the breast observed 13% after 1 month and 17% after 6 and 12 months. Changes in the skin assessed 30% of patients after 1 month and 20% after 6 and 12 months of observation. Conclusions: After 12 months median time ot follow-up no recurrences or sever toxicity was observed. The cosmetic outcome was good to excellent in 80% of patients and 86,7% of them feel good and very good after 12 month of the observation.

Gilardi,2015.0,High-dose Ionizing Radiation Regulates Gene Expression Changes in the MCF7 Breast Cancer Cell Line,", ","BACKGROUND: Intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT) is a therapeutic technique which administers a single high dose of ionizing radiation immediately after surgical tumor removal. IOERT induces a strong stress response: both tumor and normal cells activating pro- and antiproliferative cell signaling pathways. Following treatment, several genes and factors are differently modulated, producing an imbalance in cell fate decision. However, the contribution of these genes and pathways in conferring different cell radiosensitivity and radioresistance needs to be further investigated, in particular after high-dose treatments. Despite the documented and great impact of IOERT in breast cancer care, and the trend for dose escalation, very limited data are available regarding gene-expression profiles and cell networks activated by IOERT or high-dose treatment. The aim of the study was to analyze the main pathways activated following high radiation doses in order to select for potential new biomarkers of radiosensitivity or radioresistance, as well as to identify therapeutic targets useful in cancer care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed gene-expression profiling of the MCF7 human breast carcinoma cell line after treatment with 9- and 23-Gy doses (conventionally used during IOERT boost and exclusive treatments, respectively) by cDNA microarrays. Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence and immunoblot experiments were performed to validate candidate IOERT biomarkers. We also conducted clonogenic tests and cellular senescence assays to monitor for radiation-induced effects. RESULTS: The analyses highlighted a transcriptome dependent on the dose delivered and a number of specific key genes that may be proposed as new markers of radiosensitivity. Cell and molecular traits observed in MCF7 cells revealed a typical senescent phenotype associated with cell proliferation arrest after treatments with 9- and 23-Gy doses. CONCLUSION: In this study, we report genes and cellular networks activated following high-dose IOERT. The selected validated genes were used to design two descriptive models for each dose delivered. We believe that this study could contribute to the understanding over the complex mechanisms which regulate cell radiosensitivity and radioresistance in order to improve personalized radiotherapeutic treatment.",eng,0
Journal Article,M. W. Brechbiel; T. A. Waldmann,2000.0,Anti-HER2 radioimmunotherapy,", ","HER2/neu is a receptor protein whose overexpression strongly correlates with poor prognosis in breast carcinomas. It is used increasingly as a therapeutic target for breast carcinomas in clinical human trials. In particular, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target HER2/neu have been investigated for therapeutic applications. Anti-Her2 mAbs linked to radionuclides have been used in pre-clinical models and in patients for radioimmunolocalization of tumors using external scintigraphy and intraoperative handheld gamma detecting probes. Initial efforts of systemic radioimmunotherapy employed radio-iodinated mAbs. In a murine human breast cancer xenograft model, the radiolabeled mAb was 20-fold more effective than the unarmed mAb but did not yield permanent eradication of the tumor. Due to the limitations of radio-iodine ((131)I), metallic radionuclides (e.g, the beta(-)-emmiter (90)Y or the alpha-emitters (213)Bi, (212)Bi, (212)Pb) linked to mAb's are being evaluated in murine models. Complete elimination of beast cancer xenografts was possible in an adjuvant setting using (212)Pb linked to an anti-HER2/neu mAb. Finally, major efforts are underway to increase the access of the radiolabel to the tumor cell in large solid tumors. One such approach involved a pre-targeting strategy with an initial administration of streptavidin linked to mAb that, after a clearing step, was followed by biotin armed with the radionuclide. Although major challenges must be addressed, HER2/neu represents a very attractive target for systemic radioimmunotherapy of breast cancer.",eng,0

We hypothesized that the AlloDerm hammock may allow greater intraoperative volume expansion and potentially avoid the need for an autologous construct. METHODS: Tissue expanders were filled to 75%-85% capacity intraoperatively and 85%-100% prior to radiation therapy. This allowed for maximum preservation of the mastectomy skin envelope prior to radiation therapy and provided a sizable breast mound immediately following mastectomy. Histology of irradiated and nonirradiated capsules was compared. RESULTS: Five patients aged 29-51 years had immediate implant (1) or expander-implant (4) breast reconstruction followed by postreconstruction radiation 2-6 months following the procedure. Patients were followed for 2.5-5.5 years following implant reconstruction and 2-5 years following radiation. No capsular contracture or implant loss was observed in any patient. No patients required or requested autologous reconstruction following radiation and all currently have silicone implants. Capsular biopsies from radiated and nonradiated implants showed identical collagen architecture on histology, confirming clinical observations. CONCLUSION: Tissue expander-implant breast reconstruction following mastectomy preserves the skin envelope in patients who receive postmastectomy radiation. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether complete implant coverage with the pectoralis muscle and AlloDerm hammock mitigates the deleterious effects of radiation.",eng,0

Methods and Materials: CT-based 3-dimensional planning with dose optimization was completed. APBI treatment of 34. Gy in 3.4. Gy fractions was delivered. Endpoints analyzed included: (1) The percentage of the prescribed dose (PD) covering the planning target volume (PTV), (2) the maximum skin dose as a percentage of the PD, (3) the maximum rib dose as a percentage of the PD, and (4) the V150 and V200. Results: The C-MLB was placed more frequently in patients with closer skin spacing (<7 mm) and rib spacing (<7 mm) than in MS patients (45.5% vs. 12.1%, p= 0.0057 and 57.6 vs. 33.3, p= 0.0131, respectively). Despite closer skin spacing, the overall median skin dose was significantly lower in C-MLB patients (112% of the PD vs. 134%, p= 0.0282). No statistically significant differences in the V150 or V200 were observed. In patients with very limited rib spacing (<4 mm), the C-MLB delivered significantly lower rib doses than the MS (144% of the PD vs. 191%, p= 0.0107). In all clinical scenarios, coverage of the PTV with the C-MLB was either equal to or significantly better than with the MS (p= 0.0024). Conclusion: The C-MLB catheter produced clinically significant improvements in dosimetric endpoints (e.g., reduced skin and rib doses and improved PTV coverage) in most clinical scenarios. © 2011 American Brachytherapy Society.",,0

Materials and Methods: From 05/07 to 05/08, 41 patients, from a single surgeon (PI), were treated with breast conserving therapy (BCT) received adjuvant radiation using the ConturaTM catheter (34 Gy in 3.4 Gy fractions). 13/41 patients (31.7%) had stage 0 disease, 21 (51.2%) had stage I and 7 (17.1%) had stage II breast cancer. For each patient, the dosimetric plan was customized using the 5 high dose rate brachytherapy channels of the ConturaTM catheter by selecting from 45 different dwell positions (9 per catheter). Results: Median, minimum skin spacing was 10 mm (range 2 to 17). The median maximum skin dose (% of prescribed dose [PD]) was 99.7 (57.1 to 124.1). Eight patients were able to be treated with a skin spacing of 5 mm or less, 2 had spacing of 2 mm.

The improvements in imaging have in turn allowed a higher level of complexity to be incorporated into radiotherapy treatment planning systems. As a result of these changes, the delivery of radiotherapy evolved from therapy designed based primarily on plain (two dimensional) x-ray images and hand calculations to three-dimensional x-ray based images incorporating increasingly complex computer algorithms. More recently, biologic variables based on differences between tumor metabolism, tumor antigens, and normal tissues have been incorporated into the treatment process. In addition, greater awareness of the challenges to the accuracy of the treatment planning process, such as problems with set-error and organ movement, have begun to be systematically addressed, ushering in an era of so-called Four-Dimensional Radiotherapy. This review article discusses how these advances have changed the way the most common neoplasms are treated now and will be treated in the near future. © American Cancer Society, Inc., 2005.",,0

We evaluated an epicardial 13-MHz ultrasound minitransducer as a means to detect three different coronary anastomosis construction errors. METHODS: In total, 120 internal thoracic artery-to-coronary artery anastomoses were constructed correctly (n = 60) or incorrectly (n = 60) with one technical error: suture crossover, purse-string or deep toe stitch (n = 20 each). Anastomoses were performed on ex vivo pressure-perfused porcine (96 anastomoses) and human hearts (24 anastomoses). Two blinded observers scanned and scored the anastomoses with epicardial ultrasonography. In 24 human and 24 porcine anastomoses, angiograms were made of 24 correct and 24 incorrect anastomoses and scored by two other blinded observers. Angioscopy and cast injection served as a reference. RESULTS: Overall, 119 of 120 anastomoses were accurately scored as correct or incorrect within a median of 67 seconds (8-381 seconds) by both observers (sensitivity 0.98, specificity 1.00, kappa 1.00 (1.00, 1.00, and 1.00 in angiography subset, respectively). One deep toe stitch that induced outflow corner stenosis was spotted by both observers but regarded as insignificant and thus inaccurately scored as correct. In 5 anastomoses, unintended irregularities were detected. By angiography, anastomoses were accurately scored with a sensitivity of 0.75 and a specificity of 0.81 ( P < .001 vs ultrasonography) and kappa of 0.54. Angioscopy and cast confirmed ultrasonographic findings and did not reveal irregularities other than detected by ultrasonography. CONCLUSION: Ex vivo epicardial 13-MHz ultrasonography allowed rapid and accurate evaluation of coronary anastomoses and detected technical construction errors with higher sensitivity and specificity than angiography.",eng,0

METHODS: Of the 1022 women treated with BCT at Tata Memorial Hospital, there was a cohort of 175 women who were premenopausal, node negative and had not received any adjuvant systemic therapy. BCT consisted of wide excision, complete axillary clearance, whole breast radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions) with 6 MV photons plus tumour bed boost either with brachytherapy or electrons. RESULTS: The median age at presentation was 38 years (range 22-51 years) and the median pathological tumour size was 3 cm (1-5 cm). The 5-year actuarial local control rate was 89.5% and the overall survival (OS) was 88%. On univariate analysis, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was the only prognostic factor affecting all failures and disease-free survival. The 5-year local control rate in absence of LVI was 93.5% in contrast to 76.5% (p=0.0098) when LVI was present. Similarly, the OS in absence of LVI was 91% in contrast to 74% in presence of LVI (p=0.02). On multivariate analysis, LVI was the independent prognostic factor affecting the disease-free survival (p=0.001; 95% CI: 1.46-4.96). CONCLUSION: LVI emerged as the most important prognostic factor for node negative premenopausal women not receiving adjuvant systemic therapy. There is a need to take into consideration the presence of LVI while deciding adjuvant systemic therapy in T1N0 patients.",eng,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1980 and 2000, 1022 pathological stage I/II breast cancer patients underwent breast-conserving therapy. On the basis of the type of tumour bed boost they received after whole breast radiotherapy, these women were assigned to three groups: (A) low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy of 15-20 Gy (n=383); (B) high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy of 10 Gy (optimised) in a single fraction (n=153); (C) electron beam 15 Gy/six fractions (n=460). Systemic adjuvant therapy was given to 757 women, of whom 570 received adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Cosmesis at the last follow-up was good or excellent in 77% of women. Post-radiation worsening of cosmesis was observed in 11.5% of women and was similar in the three boost groups. Moderate to severe late breast sequelae were observed in 22% of women in group B, which was significantly higher than the 12% in group A (P=0.002) and 9% in group C (P=0.0001). The actuarial 5-year local control rate was 91% and was 90, 92 and 93% in groups A, B and C, respectively. Tumour size (P=0.049) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P=0.04) were the significant factors affecting cosmetic outcome on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy was the only factor leading to worsening in the cosmetic outcome, with P=0.03 (hazard ratio 1.65 [95% confidence interval 1.05-2.59]). CONCLUSION: The type of tumour bed boost did not have a significant effect on the worsening of cosmetic outcome. However, there were significantly more late breast sequelae in women treated with single fraction HDR implants. Chemotherapy had an adverse effect on the cosmetic outcome, but the late breast sequelae and local control rates were comparable.",eng,0

The goals of surgery are to remove the tumor with adequate margins while maintaining an excellent cosmetic outcome. Multiple factors have been associated with higher local recurrence rates, including positive surgical margins. For most nonpalpable breast cancers, needle localization is considered the gold standard for tumor localization when performing lumpectomies. By contrast, palpable breast cancers have historically been excised to grossly negative margins based on palpation alone, which may lead to higher positive margin rates. As a result, ultrasound has been proposed as a tool for intraoperative guidance in the surgical excision of palpable masses. The trial under discussion is a randomized study demonstrating that the use of ultrasound intraoperatively to guide breast conservation surgery decreases the rate of positive margins and the volume of excised tissue, potentially allowing for a better cosmetic outcome.",eng,0

The INTRABEAM [1] source in use in this hospital is sent for calibration on an annual basis after which it must be re-commissioned for clinical use. Currently this involves an output measurement in solid water using an ion chamber, an assessment of isotropy using thermoluminescent dosimeters and measurement of depth doses using EBT radiochromic film [2]. This is a very time consuming process. By using laser micro machined EBT3 Gafchromic film, triple channel film dosimetry and Matlab analysis it is possible to streamline the re-commissioning process into a single check. Methods: Measurements of output, isotropy and depth doses were performed for a 4.5 cmspherical applicator.Symmetry is assessed at 0.5 cmfrom the surface of the probe and is normalised to the Z-axis. Depth dose is assessed on the Z-axis and absolute dose is measured at the prescription point. Results: Symmetry results vary from -10 to +4%, which is in good agreement with the anisotropic distribution previously recorded. Typical absolute dose measurements are reproducible to within 4%. Measured depth doses agree to within 3% +/- 2%. For current methods a tolerance of 5% and action level of 10% is in use. Conclusions: Results indicate that EBT3 is a viable option to assess percentage depth dose, probe symmetry and absolute dose. The technique is still experimental and will need further investigation but shows the potential to streamline the re-commissioning process. (Figure presented).",,0

Meric-Bernstam,2007.0,Role for intraoperative margin assessment in patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery,10.1245/s10434-006-9236-0,"BACKGROUND: Positive/close margins are associated with higher in-breast failure rates after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). We investigated whether intraoperative margin assessment aids in obtaining negative margins, and to evaluate the local control thus achieved. METHODS: Between 1994 and 1996, 264 patients underwent BCS for stages 0-III breast cancer [invasive, n = 200; ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), n = 64]. Intraoperative margin assessment included gross tissue inspection, specimen radiography, with or without frozen section. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients (46%) with invasive cancer and 24 (38%) with DCIS had positive/close margins on the permanent section analysis of their initial surgical specimens. Fifty-eight patients (29%) with invasive cancer and six (9%) with DCIS had initial positive/close margins, and were rendered margin-negative by intraoperative analysis and immediate re-excision. Final margins on permanent pathology were positive/close in 52 patients (20%): 34 patients (17%) with invasive cancer and 18 patients (28%) with DCIS. By multivariate analysis, excisional biopsy for diagnosis, larger tumor size, and multifocality were associated with final positive/close margins. Of these 52 patients, 23 underwent a second operation to achieve widely negative margins (13 completion mastectomies, 10 re-excisions). The 5-year ipsilateral breast recurrence-free survival rates after BCS and radiation were 99% for invasive cancer (n = 167) and 100% for DCIS (n = 27). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative assessment of margins assisted in identifying positive/close margins and allowed over a quarter of the patients to be rendered margin-negative with intraoperative re-excision at their original operation. This approach resulted in excellent local control in patients treated with BCS and radiation.",eng,0

Reilly,2013.0,Investigation of the effects of cell model and subcellular location of gold nanoparticles on nuclear dose enhancement factors using Monte Carlo simulation,10.1118/1.4823787,"PURPOSE: The authors' aims were to model how various factors influence radiation dose enhancement by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and to propose a new modeling approach to the dose enhancement factor (DEF). METHODS: The authors used Monte Carlo N-particle (MCNP 5) computer code to simulate photon and electron transport in cells. The authors modeled human breast cancer cells as a single cell, a monolayer, or a cluster of cells. Different numbers of 5, 30, or 50 nm AuNPs were placed in the extracellular space, on the cell surface, in the cytoplasm, or in the nucleus. Photon sources examined in the simulation included nine monoenergetic x-rays (10-100 keV), an x-ray beam (100 kVp), and (125)I and (103)Pd brachytherapy seeds. Both nuclear and cellular dose enhancement factors (NDEFs, CDEFs) were calculated. The ability of these metrics to predict the experimental DEF based on the clonogenic survival of MDA-MB-361 human breast cancer cells exposed to AuNPs and x-rays were compared. RESULTS: NDEFs show a strong dependence on photon energies with peaks at 15, 30/40, and 90 keV. Cell model and subcellular location of AuNPs influence the peak position and value of NDEF. NDEFs decrease in the order of AuNPs in the nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, and extracellular space. NDEFs also decrease in the order of AuNPs in a cell cluster, monolayer, and single cell if the photon energy is larger than 20 keV. NDEFs depend linearly on the number of AuNPs per cell. Similar trends were observed for CDEFs. NDEFs using the monolayer cell model were more predictive than either single cell or cluster cell models of the DEFs experimentally derived from the clonogenic survival of cells cultured as a monolayer. The amount of AuNPs required to double the prescribed dose in terms of mg Au/g tissue decreases as the size of AuNPs increases, especially when AuNPs are in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. For 40 keV x-rays and a cluster of cells, to double the prescribed x-ray dose (NDEF = 2) using 30 nm AuNPs, would require 5.1 +/- 0.2, 9 +/- 1, 10 +/- 1, 10 +/- 1 mg Au/g tissue in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm, on the cell surface, or in the extracellular space, respectively. Using 50 nm AuNPs, the required amount decreases to 3.1 +/- 0.3, 8 +/- 1, 9 +/- 1, 9 +/- 1 mg Au/g tissue, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NDEF is a new metric that can predict the radiation enhancement of AuNPs for various experimental conditions. Cell model, the subcellular location and size of AuNPs, and the number of AuNPs per cell, as well as the x-ray photon energy all have effects on NDEFs. Larger AuNPs in the nucleus of cluster cells exposed to x-rays of 15 or 40 keV maximize NDEFs.",eng,0

In order to check it, international quality assurance protocol tests for TPS were adapted to IORT with different heterogeneities configurations, more demanding than the ones used for clinical practice: solid water step, lung (type chest wall and mediastinum-lung), bone and shielding disks for breast IORT. These tests were performed for different applicator sizes, bevel angles and beam energy. Gafchromic EBT2 radiochromic films were used for dose measurements in Elekta Precise and Varian 21EX linacs. Results: Different profiles and isodoses curves were obtained, according to different heterogeneities setups. For profiles, lack of accuracy was kept within 3% or 4% in solid water step, lung and bone type heterogeneities with bevel 0 applicators; more accurate than others pencil beam algorithms described in the literature. Discrepancies were higher for bevel angles, but evaluation of dose distributions showed that more than 95% of the points passed the gamma test with 4% in dose and 4 mm in distance. The main limitation appeared on top of the shielding disk, because pencil beam algorithm cannot model backscatter radiation. Nevertheless, the modeling of the attenuation underneath the disk was in good agreement with measurements. (Figure presented) Conclusions: Pencil beam is able to model IORT beams for dose calculation, even in heterogeneous media, and supposes an important advance from previous IORT dosimetric calculations based in water measurements, which is the current state of the art in the field. With this work, we have completed the verification of the algorithm implemented in radianceTM TPS by GMV (Madrid, Spain). The authors expect that further research with the Montecarlo algorithm can improve the limitations of the semi-infinite layer approximation and poor backscattering modeling.",,0

Materials: 37 patients were treated using Mobetron 1000 MD-51, using electron energy 4-6-9 Mev at high dose per pulse, bevelled applicators at the end of 0degree, 15degree and 30degree and collimator diameters from 4 to 6 cm. The prescribed dose was 9 Gy at the depth of 90% isodose and in two cases 21 Gy at the depth of 90% isodose. Exit dose from target was measured using calibrated radiochromic films EBT2 above a steel shield 4 mm thickness placed at the depth of 90% isodose and exit dose on lung was measured using films under the shield. Backscatter contribution of shielding was measured in a water phantom using radiochromic films at the depth of 90% and 100 % isodose for all energies. Films were scanned using Epson 10000XL and analyzed on green channel. Results: The mean deviation between measured and expected exit dose from target was 1.9% (SD 6.6%) at 4 Mev, 4.5% (SD 5.5%) at 6 Mev and 0.1 % (SD 7.4%) at 9 Mev; instead if we consider the bevel of applicators the mean deviation was 3.8% (SD 6.1%) at 0degree, 3.0% (SD 4.8%) at 15degree and -4.8% (SD 7.2%) at 30'. Backscatter contribution was about 18% for all energies at the depth of 90% and about 5% at the depth of 100% isodose, as confirmed in literature. In all cases exit dose on lung above the steel shield was negligible. The results show that there is a satisfactory agreement between prescribed and measured dose. Conclusions: The results show that there is a satisfactory agreement between prescribed and measured dose. Electron backscatter sure increases measured dose at the depth of 90% isodose and uniforms dose between depths of 90% isodose and 100% isodose. In case of 30degree bevelled applicators the measured dose is lower than expected. This is probably due to a greater difficulty in the shielding positioning and in a uniform target irradiation.",,0

IORT is a real-time vision guided and surgically supported (intra-pathology, normal tissue displacement, post-IORT reconstructive procedures). IORT as a dose-component (boost) for dose-escalation strategies has reported local control rates over 95% In adjuvant or high-risk post-resection cancer models (locally advanced primary rectal cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, etc.), over 70% in resection involved margin status (pelvic recurrences, oligotopic metastasis, etc.) and over 50% in unresected cancer patients categories (pancreatic cancer model). IORT is investigated as the sole component of irradiation (in the range of 20-22 Gy) in prospective non-inferiority randomized trials for early breast cancer with preliminary favourable results. Recent clinical innovations in IORT included the development of trials with IORT component and hypofractionated external radiotherapy, the incorporation of IORT to laparoscopic cancer surgery and the systematic evaluation of in-vivo dosimetry. Technical innovations are the development of miniaturized radiation devices specifically designed for intra-surgical use including high energy electrons or low X-rays source, together with treatment planning systems including virtual simulation, surgical navigation and dosimetric distribution estimations features. Surgeons, Radiation Oncologists and Medical Physicists will be guided by treatment planning systems in the decision-making process with an integrated multidisciplinary teamapproach vision. IORT scientists and experts institutions have actively reported technical developments, clinical results and innovative projects. In the decade 1997-2007, 694 Pubmed indexed publications were available with accumulative impact factor over 1.300,000. An update up to May 2010, identifies 104 (277,856 I.F.) new additions.

Modern IORT is carried out with electron beams (IOERT) produced by a linear accelerator generally used for external beam irradiation (EBRT) or a specialized mobile electron accelerator. HDR brachytherapy (HDR-IORT) has also been applied on selected locations. Retrospective analysis of clinical experiences in cancer sites such as operable pancreatic tumour, locally advanced/recurrent rectal cancer, head and neck carcinomas, sarcomas and cervical cancer are consistent with local tumour control promotion compared to similar clinical experiences without IORT. New emerging indications such as the treatment of breast cancer are presented. The IORT component of the therapeutical approach allows intensification of the total radiation dose without additional exposure of healthy tissues and improves dose-deposit homogeneity and precision. Results of the application of IORT on selected disease sites are presented with an analysis on future possibilities. To improve the methodology, clinical trials are required with multivariate analysis including patient, tumour and treatment characteristics, prospective evaluation of early and late toxicity, patterns of tumour recurrence and overall patient outcome. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Background: Currently, intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy clinical practice lacks a treatment planning system. Materials and methods: The RADIANCE concept approaches treatment planning by providing the user with a navigation platform based on a three-dimensional imaging system in which the radiation oncologist can target the tumor and risk areas in different sections (axial, coronal, sagittal), while a volume rendering engine displays a 3D image that is automatically updated as we make any changes of the space. Finally, the user may select the parameters of the applicator, energy and dose of treatment to optimize the procedure. Six cases are clinically described and illustrated. Results: RADIANCE is a useful tool in planning IOERT. Tumor segmentation and risk areas with minimal guide in the selection of parameters for the applicator. Complex locations are challenging, where the experience and skill of the radiation oncologist is necessary to optimize the process. New developments include imaging innovated uses. Intraoperative imaging will approach reality and allow real time, dosimetry estimations, stereotactic recognition of patient and tumor bed position, will guide automatization of radiation beam recognition and pre-robotic arrangements with linear accelerator movements.

Forty-five clinical contributions described treatment results with an IORT component in tumors of the central nervous system, head and neck, pleura, breast, gastric, pancreatic, bile duct, colo-rectal, genitourinary and gynecologic cancer, together with soft tissue and bone sarcomas. Rectal cancer results were the most frequently reported, analyzed in 14 abstracts (9 for primary locally advanced disease and 5 for pelvic recurrences). Local tumor control promotion was universally observed (not related to anatomic tumor site or histology) with a tendency to be influenced by postsurgical tumor residue (macro vs micro) and/or disease status (primary vs recurrent). Ureters and peripheral nerves are confirmed as dose-sensitive structures in IORT trials. It is particularly impressive the reproductibility of tissue tolerance local control and survival rates among trials with similiar strategies and integral treatment intensity. IORT is near to accomplish its initial 15 years in western medicine and oncology. New Technology is emerging, specifically design for IORT, that will change radically the clinical practice in the next century: a portable mini-linear accelerator will be able to treat patients in the surgical floor of any hospital, moving the electron field to the patient requiring IORT and not the opposite as it is performed nowadays; a second alternative will be a mini-accelerator installed in a robotic arm exclusively dedicated to IORT. Both developments will overcome the complexity inherent of IORT in the present, and will held to expand the technique in the near oncologic future.",,0

Multicatheter Interstitial Breast Brachytherapy (MIBB) is an effective and safe technique for Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) in properly selected breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery. MIBB technique allows reach the highest dose conformity and sparing healthy tissue ability respect of different APBI methods (Balloon, 3DCRT and Intraoperative Radiotherapy). MIBB is usually performed as closedcavity procedure. This condition allows proper selection patients for APBI according to definitive pathological features but has some disadvantages since implies a second operation room visit for patient, determine a indirect visualisation of tumor bed with the consequently risk to make a geographical error dimmed frequently by performing extensive implants. Minimally Invasive Intraoperative Multicatheter Breast Implant (MIOMBI) represents an alternative to classic MIBB procedure with potential logistics, clinical and cosmetics advantages. Materials and Methods: Patients with early breast cancer candidates for conservative surgery were eligible for MIOMBI technique with 6F flexible catheters. Perioperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy (PHDRBT) was delivered as APBI (3.4 Gy for 10 in five days) in patients who met low- and intermediate-risk criteria according to GEC ESTRO recommendations, (women older than 40 years, infiltrating ductal carcinoma less than 2 cm with extensive intraductal carcinoma less than 25%, pN0, free margins more than 2mm and intraductal carcinoma less than 3 cm.) Those patients who did not meet previous criteria receive PHDRBT as anticipatory boost (4 fractions of 3.4 Gy in two days BAT) followed by hypofractionated whole breast irradiation 39.9 Gy in 15 fractions. Results: From April 2010 to July 2013 101 consecutive breast cancer patients have been treated with conservative surgery and MIOMBI. The median time for MIOMBI procedure was 25 minutes. The median of number of catheter employed was 9 (4-14). No intraoperative complications were observed. Major complications RTOG grade 3-4 (acute and late) was observed only in one patient (1%) who suffered bleeding complication after implant remove. Infection (mastitis or abscess) was observed in 3 patients (2%). Fat necrosis with no symptoms was observed in 2 patients. PHDRBT was delivered as APBI in 64 patients (60%) and as a boost in 34 (40%). The median of CTV-T (clips zone plus 2 cm) was 41 cc with a median D90 of 3.27 Gy (96%) and DHI in CTV-T of 0.71. The median V100 and V150 was 60cc and 13cc, respectively, with a median DHI of 0.76. Median D10 in high-risk skin zone was 1.91 Gy (56%). With a median followup of 22 months (2-34) no (local, elsewhere, regional or distant) failure was observed. Cosmetic outcomes were evaluated in 46 of 64 APBI treatments (71%) with excellent and good results in 61% and 37%, respectively, and fair in 2%. Conclusions: Minimally invasive intraoperative multicatheter breast implant (MIOMBI) for perioperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy (PHDRBT) avoids a second surgical procedure, allows direct visualisation of tumor bed reducing the implant extension and keeps all advantages (dosimetric and proper selection patients for APBI) of the classic MIBB technique.

Cosmetic outcome in APBI patients was excellent or good in (87.0%) and fair or poor in (11.9%) while in boost patients was excellent or good in (76.4%) and fair in (23.5%). CONCLUSION: The FHIOMBI-PHDRBT program does not add complications to conservative surgery. It allows precise selection of APBI patients and offers excellent results in disease control and cosmetics. It also offers logistic advantages because it dramatically shortens the time of local treatment and avoids further invasive procedures.",eng,0

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was done of 257 patients who underwent 267 consecutive lumpectomy operations and completed radiation therapy at our institution. Margins in 189 patients were assessed using frozen section analysis of shaved margins from the lumpectomy cavity. RESULTS: Breast conserving therapy was performed for 220 (83%) patients with early breast cancer (T1 and T2 tumors) and 47 (17%) with ductal carcinoma in situ. With a median followup of 5.6 years, the crude locoregional recurrence rates for patients who had margins analyzed intraoperatively by frozen section analysis or margins analyzed by permanent analysis were 1.9% (3 of 157) and 3.1% (2 of 63), respectively, for early breast cancer and 15.6% (5 of 32) and 6.6% (1 of 15) for ductal carcinoma in situ (p=NS). Survival rates were 97% and 78%, at 5 and 10 years, respectively, for the early breast cancer patients, and 98% and 98%, respectively, for ductal carcinoma in situ patients. Permanent intraoperative frozen section analysis reexcision rates were 33.3% (26 of 78) and 5.8% (11 of 189). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the technique used for margin analysis, breast conserving therapy led to low locoregional recurrence relative to national figures, pointing to the importance of the technique of radiation therapy at our institution. Reexcision rate was reduced with the use of frozen section analysis.",eng,0

METHODS: Radiochromic films were placed between the slices of an anthropomorphic phantom modeling the patient. The pregnant woman was seated in a chair with the breast over a table and inside a leaded box. Dose variation as a function of distance from the implant volume as well as dose homogeneity within a representative slice of the fetal position was evaluated without and with shielding. RESULTS: With shielding, the peripheral dose after a complete treatment ranged from 50 cGy at 5 cm from the caudal edge of the breast to <0.1 cGy at 30 cm. The shielding reduces absorbed dose by a factor of two near the breast and more than an order of magnitude beyond 20 cm. The dose is heterogeneous within a given axial plane, with variations from the central region within 50%. Interstitial HDR (192)Ir brachytherapy with breast shielding can be more advantageous than external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) from a radiation protection point of view, as long as the distance to the uterine fundus is higher than about 10 cm. Furthermore, the weight of the shielding here proposed is notably lower than that needed in EBRT. CONCLUSIONS: Shielded breast brachytherapy may benefit pregnant patients needing localized radiotherapy, especially during the early gestational ages when the fetus is more sensitive to ionizing radiation.",eng,0

That allows to protect the adjacent healthy tissues. The purpose of this study was the assessment of toxicity and survival of intra-operative radiotherapy in exclusive treatment or overimpression of primary tumors and relapse. Materials: Retrospective study carried out between February 2008 and December 2010 in 29 patients who were administered IOERT as part of multi- disciplinary treatment. 72.4% were women and 27.6% men. The median age was 63 years (range 38-82). The classification according to the localization was: 41.4% breast, 34.4% colon-rectal, upper limb 10.3%, lower limb 6.8%, gynaecological: 3.4% and pancreas 3.4%. 58.6% were administered IOERT as primary treatment, 4 patients as overimpression (9 Gy) and 8 as exclusive treatment (21 Gy). 82.8% showed R0 after surgery. The most frequently used diameter of the applicator was 6 cm (27.6%) and the electron energy: 6-15 MeV. The dose varies according to the intention (9-21 Gy, median 14.92 Gy) and the surgical margin. 27.6% were administered later external radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment (median dose 44.5 Gy). Results: With a median 34 month, the current overall survival was 75.9 %. The disease free survival (DFS) and the nodal relapse were 79.3% and 89.7%, respectively. The current local control was 93.1% with no statistically significant differences between primary versus relapse. Of the patients with relapse after treatment, 60% received chemotherapy with criteria of disease progresion at 60%. Three of those patients (10.3%) died due to surgical complications. The maximum acute toxicity was Gii: dermatitis 27.6%, genitourinary 10.3% and moderate limitation in mobility was 6.8%. Two patients presented neuropatic pain Giii with improvement one month after treatment end. No later complications have been assessed because of the short monitoring period. Conclusions: The use of IOERT, either as a relapse treatment or primary tumor (exclusive or overdosing on surgical bed) offers acceptable results of local control. It minimizes toxicity and the duration of the treatment.",,0

Boparai,2004.0,The impact of intra-operative specimen radiographs on specimen weights for wide local excision of breast cancer,10.1016/j.breast.2004.01.010,"The ultimate goal of breast conserving surgery (BCS) is to achieve survival and local control rates similar to those for mastectomy while providing improved cosmetic and functional results. The volume of breast tissue removed is the most significant determinant of the final cosmetic outcome of BCS. We hypothesised that intra-operative specimen radiograph (IOSR) during BCS may guide the surgeon to achieve clear radiographic and histological margins with minimum normal breast tissue excision, thus preserving cosmetic appearance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of introducing the policy of IOSR on the weight of specimens of wide local excision of palpable invasive breast cancer. All consecutive patients who underwent therapeutic wide local excision for palpable invasive breast cancer from 01/01/02 to 31/03/03 were included in this study. A policy of IOSR was introduced in October 2002, thus all BCS done after 01/10/2002 underwent IOSR. The mean (S.D.) specimen weight for the no intra-operative specimen radiograph (NIOSR) group was 74 grams compared to 46 g in the IOSR group, (P = 0.0241, unpaired t-test with Welch's correction) and the mean tumour size for the NIOSR was 23(13)mm and for IOSR was 21(8)mm (P = ns, unpaired t-test with Welch's correction). A histologically clear circumferential margin rate in the IOSR group was 96% compared to 82% in the NIOSR group. Five patients in the IOSR group and 11 in NIOSR group had positive anterior or posterior margin. For these patients no further surgical excision was possible as BCS was performed from skin to pectoral fascia. Therefore a radiation boost was given to the site of excision. Only one patient in the IOSR group needed further breast surgery (mastectomy) for a positive inferior (toward nipple) margin for a mammographically occult tumour, while 11 patients in the NIOSR group required further breast surgery. In conclusion, IOSR is a simple, effective and economical way of assessing adequacy of margins while minimising the breast tissue excised during wide local excision of palpable breast cancers.",eng,0

However, there is no method to visualize the remaining microinvasive carcinomas during surgery. We are currently investigating a new technique, X-ray Luminescent Tomography, to visualize residual disease. This technique utilizes nanoparticles, which emit optical light when irradiated with X-ray, such as that utilized in IORT. By imaging depth and extent of the tumor, this technique would give surgeons and radiation oncologists a spatial distribution of tumor extent, thus giving greater comfort with single stage breast cancer resection and radiation treatment. This study investigates the feasibility of visualizing nanoparticles at depth with an IORT radiation source within geometries relevant to breast surgery. Materials/Methods: A numerical phantom was constructed of properties representative from nano-sized Gadolinium Oxysulfide phosphors doped with Europium (a red-emitting dopant), characterized in our lab. A 7x12cm rectangular phantom was implemented with typical optical properties found in the female breast. The phantom had 10mg/mL of phosphor added to cylindrical inclusions of diameters (2, 6, 10, 14mm) to simulate lesions. Phosphors were added to the background at 2mg/mL, to simulate imperfect contrast uptake. Light output was simulated for a 50keV tube voltage, similar to IORT device, and optical light was collected at a distance of 15cm from the phantom. Inclusions were placed at various depths to determine the decline in contrast with depth. Images were reconstructed using a software package designed to model the hybrid X-ray/optical physics. Recovered contrast was determined by comparing the true value of the concentration of nanoparticles with the mean recovered value in the inclusion region. Results: Results showed that at a contrast of 5:1 (10mg/mL:2mg/mL), all inclusions were recovered with at least 75% accuracy at depths less than 1.5cm. As the depth increased, recovered tissue concentrations were less accurate. Concentration recovery fell below 50% beyond 1cm for the 2mm inclusion, 2cm for the 6mm inclusion, 3cm for the 10mm inclusion, and 4cm for the 14mm inclusion. Conclusions: The potential of a hybrid X-ray/optical imaging system was demonstrated in a simulation study. The sensitivity of this technique is superior compared to other reflectance-based imaging modalities at depth, such as Fluorescence Molecular Imaging. Future research will focus on achieving highly specific targeting for malignant breast cancer cells. In addition, studies will focus on large-animals to determine the effectiveness of this technique.",,0

Currently, a standard method to visualize the remaining microscopic diseases after surgery does not exist. We are currently investigating a new technique, Radio-luminescence imaging, which utilizes molecularly- targeted nanophosphors to visualize residual disease. These nanoparticles emit optical light when irradiated, which can be detected by sensitive optical detectors; we have shown this imaging technique to be potentially more sensitive than positron emission tomography or fluorescence optical imaging. By localizing multiple molecular markers that are specific to a certain tumor, this technique would aid in treatment by providing feedback as to the extent of disease. This study demonstrates the sensitivity and ability of this technology in experimental phantoms and small-animalmodels, and outlines steps needed to translate this technique to the clinic. Materials/Methods: Several experimental models were examined to test the performance and feasibility of this technique.We first investigated the sensitivity in phantoms loaded with phosphor and agar solution.We then determined the ability to recover multiple agents simultaneously byimaging phantomswith various concentrations of bothBaYF4, dopedwith eitherTerbium(Tb) or Europium (Eu),whichemit green and red light, respectively.We then imaged a small-animalmodel injected with both types of particles. All data was acquired with a diagnostic X-ray source for particle excitation, and a cooled-CCD coupled to a camera lens for imaging. Results: The detection limit was determined to be sub-picomolar. The particles showed excellent linearity (correlation coefficient for both particles r > 0.99) with concentration. The results also show an excellent ability to separate the contributions from each phosphor, with coefficients of determination of R2 >0.91 for both sets of concentrations. The technical demonstration in a small animal model also showed excellent separation between the phosphors. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate the ability of the proposed technique to provide a means to image multiple molecular markers simultaneously. Because of the low concentrations needed to resolve the phosphors, we estimate that we will be able to inject a reasonably low dose, which will still enable the resolution of multiple molecular contrasts.",,0
Journal Article,C. M. Carpenter; G. Pratx; C. Sun; L. Xing,2011.0,Limited-angle x-ray luminescence tomography: methodology and feasibility study,10.1088/0031-9155/56/12/003,"X-ray luminescence tomography (XLT) has recently been proposed as a new imaging modality for biological imaging applications. This modality utilizes phosphor nanoparticles which luminesce near-infrared light when excited by x-ray photons. The advantages of this modality are that it uniquely combines the high sensitivity of radioluminescent nanoparticles and the high spatial localization of collimated x-ray beams. Currently, XLT has been demonstrated using x-ray spatial encoding to resolve the imaging volume. However, there are applications where the x-ray excitation may be limited by geometry, where increased temporal resolution is desired, or where a lower dose is mandatory. This paper extends the utility of XLT to meet these requirements by incorporating a photon propagation model into the reconstruction algorithm in an x-ray limited-angle (LA) geometry. This enables such applications as image-guided surgery, where the ability to resolve lesions at depths of several centimeters can be the key to successful resection. The hybrid x-ray/diffuse optical model is first formulated and then demonstrated in a breast-sized phantom, simulating a breast lumpectomy geometry. Both numerical and experimental phantoms are tested, with lesion-simulating objects of various sizes and depths. Results show localization accuracy with median error of 2.2 mm, or 4% of object depth, for small 2-14 mm diameter lesions positioned from 1 to 4.5 cm in depth. This compares favorably with fluorescence optical imaging, which is not able to resolve such small objects at this depth. The recovered lesion size has lower size bias in the x-ray excitation direction than the optical direction, which is expected due to the increased optical scatter. However, the technique is shown to be quite invariant in recovered size with respect to depth, as the standard deviation is less than 2.5 mm. Sensitivity is a function of dose; radiological doses are found to provide sufficient recovery for microg ml(-1) concentrations, while therapy dosages provide recovery for ng ml(-1) concentrations. Experimental phantom results agree closely with the numerical results, with positional errors recovered within 8.6% of the effective depth for a 5 mm object, and within 5.2% of the depth for a 10 mm object. Object-size median error is within 2.3% and 2% for the 5 and 10 mm objects, respectively. For shallow-to-medium depth applications where optical and radio-emission imaging modalities are not ideal, such as in intra-operative procedures, LAXLT may be a useful tool to detect molecular signatures of disease.",eng,0

METHODS: Patients with resistant metastatic intracranial tumors who had previously undergone chemotherapy, whole-brain radiation therapy, and radiosurgery and who were recused from surgery were eligible for this trial. Under local anesthesia, a Leksell stereotactic head frame was used to insert a water-cooled interstitial fiberoptic laser applicator inside the cranium. In the bore of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, laser energy was delivered to heat the tumor while continuous MRI was performed. A computer workstation extracted temperature-sensitive information to display images of laser heating and computed estimates of the thermal damage zone. Posttreatment MRI scans were used to confirm the zone of thermal necrosis, and follow-up was performed at 7, 15, 30, and 90 days after treatment. RESULTS: In all cases, the procedure was well tolerated without secondary effect, and patients were discharged to home within 14 hours after the procedure. Follow-up imaging showed an acute increase in apparent lesion volume followed by a gradual and steady decrease. No tumor recurrence within thermal ablation zones was noted. CONCLUSION: In this ongoing trial, a total of four patients have had six metastatic tumors treated with laser thermal ablations. Magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy appears to provide a new, efficient treatment for recurrent focal metastatic brain disease. This therapy is a prelude to the future development of closed-head interventional MRI techniques in neurosurgery.",eng,0

This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of sentinel node mapping (SNM) with Indocyanine Green (ICG) as a fluorescent tracer in colorectal cancer, and to verify its sensibility, specificity and accuracy. Methods. Our pilot study is a prospective transversal intervention trial conducted with the approval and guidance of our institutional Ethics Committee. It includes patients with non-metastatic colorectal carcinomas. As part of a standard laparoscopic colorectal resection with extensive lymphadenectomy, 2 ml of ICG are initially injected around the tumour from the outside using a 150 mm long needle. A home-made device has been developed with a wound retractor (Alexis Applied Medical) and a polimetylmetaacrylate pipe (currently used for IORT procedures) which allows the use of a handheld fluorescence-detection device (Photodynamic Eye, Hamamatsu-Photonics) to detect the ICG fluorescence. The SN highlighted by the ICG are marked with titanium clips and will subsequently be ultra-staged by the pathologist with multisectioning and immunohistochemistry. A video is presented describing the surgical technique in detail. Results. The aim of the study will be reached when we obtain 73 patients with true negative SN in order to achieve a 95 % confidence interval and a negative predictive value (NPP) of 95 %. Our experience on the first cases suggests the procedure as feasible, safe and fast, requiring less than 15 min to be performed. Conclusions. The use of ICG as fluorescent marker in breast cancer and melanoma surgery has been proven to be safer and more accurate than other traditional techniques; if this study will confirm its accuracy for the colorectal cancer, this technique could allow a more appropriate and safer surgical staging of patients and help in their selection for adjuvant therapies. Furthermore it might make it possible to treat early colon cancer by local resection trough a preliminary intraoperative evaluation of the sentinel node status.",,0

The use of the sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) has vastly reduced the area of surgery. The intraoperatory radiotherapy (IORT) is a form of partial breast radiotherapy which, according to studies that have been carried out so far, produces the same results as total breast irradiation after quadrantectomy. By combining these two precedures it is possible to minimize the patient's physical and mental stress. Moreover, the SLNB is necessary for the radiotherapist to determine the right treatment in the case of metastatic or non-metastatic sentinel nodes. Methods. The two procedures were carried out on 26 women aged between 28 and 86, with a tumour size of up to 2 cm. The day before surgery a preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was performed by means of a periareolar subdermal injection of 350 MBq <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled nanocolloid. Scintigraphic images were taken up to 1 hour after the injection. On the operating table, the gamma probe signalled the radioactive nodes, which were all removed. Surgery was quadrantectomy in 19 cases and mastectomy nipple-sparing in the other 7 cases. IORT was carried out after tumorectomy by an electron accelerator NOVAC 7, giving a 21 Gys dose when only IORT was necessary or a 16 Gys dose if a boost was required (when the sentinel node was metastatic) or after a nipple-sparing mastectomy. Results. Sentinel lymphnodes (SL) were detected in all 26 cases, both by lymphoscintigraphy and by gamma probe in the course of surgery. Out of the twenty-six patients three metastatic nodes were found and in these women axillary nodes were removed, too. These patients had fortunately metastasis only in the SL. They received IORT in a boost of 16 Gys and then entered a programme of external radiotherapy over the axillary cavity. Conclusions. The surgical treatment of most breast cancer cases has changed from radical mastectomy to quadrantectomy and from axillary node dissection to SLNB (but not in all centers yet). The oncological radicality of these surgical operations has been assured by post-operative radiotherapy. Our Breast Unit is able to execute all the surgical and radiotherapy treatments in the course of only one operation. If SLs are not metastatic, the patient may have already been discharged with a propitious long-term prognosis. If SLs are metastatic, the radiotherapists must change their treatment plan giving a boost in the course of the surgery and, later, external radiotherapy over the axillary cavity.",,0

The aim of this work is to compare results in IORT characterization obtained using several ionization chambers and Fricke dosimeter; moreover a match between such results, microMOSFET and Gafchromic films, used for in vivo dosimetry, will be presented. Materials and Methods: Starting from absolute dosimetry performed with Fricke dosimeter on a LIAC (Sordina) mobile Linear accelerator with 4, 6, 8, 10 MeV electron beams, we have compared such absolute dose values with the ones obtained using PTW Advanced Markus and Roos electron chambers. Correction factors (e.g. Ksat, Kpol and Kqq') were calculated for each chamber using R. F. Laitano et al.1 method because the IAEA TSR 3982 protocol reference condition cannot be applied due to LIAC high dose per pulse rate.

Since march 2010 we have started to use MOSFET (Best Medical) detectors to determine exit dose, in order to measure the dose collected by the deeper part of the target, the detectors are placed inside a thin and sterile catheter and fixed at the centre of the PTFE side of the disk before the insertion in the breast, Monitor units (Mu) are splitted in two parts in order to perform two different measures to allow Mu corrections. The detectors were calibrated with the 4 Linac electron beams in the same geometry of daily dosimetry check; the errors in MOSFET calibration are lower than 3% for all the energies<sup>1</sup>. Prescribed doses ranging between 10 and 21 Gy at 95% or 90% isodose depending on tumor size, target depth and tumor typology, it as been established to perform MU corrections if the differences between delivered and prescribed dose is higher than 5%, taking in account isodose normalization, if MOSFET reading are lower than prescribed dose no correction because it can't exclude a bad dosimeter positioning. Results: The istogram in Figure 1 shows the percentage deviation between measured and prescribed dose corrected for depth and isodose normalization in the first part of irradiation, 12% of MOSFET readings are higher than 10%. To understand these abnormal readings we have tested different experimentally set up and we can exclude a MOSFET angular response dependence (differences lower than 6% in a range 0-180degree) and also an increase due to backscatter radiation from attenuator plate in case of a thin tissue layer on the plate (water phantom measurement with MOSFET and Gafchromic film at different depth with and without attenuator plate under the dosimeter give differences lower than 5%). Only creating a set up with different tissue layer and air interposed (using a glove semi-fill of water) and the applicator tilted we have measured differences higher than 10%.

In case of very thin targets (<10 mm) measured dose exceed the expected value of about 8%. A further investigation is mandatory to explain these results. Materials: Treatments were performed using a mobile Linear accelerator with 4, 6, 8, 10 MeV electron beams (LIAC, Sordina S.p.A., Italy), using cylindrical applicators with diameters ranging from 4 to 10 cm. A steel-PTFE plate (3mm+3mm) was placed between the deep face of the residual breast and the pectoralis muscle to minimize the thoracic wall irradiation. MOSFET (Best Medical, Canada) detectors were used to determine the dose collected by the deeper part of the target, and were placed inside a thin and sterile catheter, fixed at the centre of the PTFE side of the disk before the insertion in the breast1. The detectors were calibrated at 4 Linac electron beam energies in the same geometry of daily dosimetry check, with an error lower than 3% for all the energies. MOSFET readings were corrected for depth and isodose normalization. Monte Carlo simulation of LIAC was implemented, using EGSnrc/BEAMnrc code2. Different targets have been investigated, using cylindrical and step-shaped geometries. Results: 12% of MOSFET readings are higher than 10%. In order to investigate these abnormal data, measurements with different set up were performed. MOSFET angular response dependence can be excluded because differences are less than 6% in the range 0-180. Dose increase due to backscatter radiation from radioprotection disc (RPD) in case of a thin tissue layer on the plate can also be excluded: measurements with MOSFET and Gafchromic film, acquired in a Water phantom at different depths with and without RPD under the dosimeter, give differences lower than 5%. We have measured differences higher than 10% using a set up with different tissue layers and air interposed (for example using a glove partially filled of water). Monte Carlo simulations results confirms measured data. E-beam low energies components, which are greater in the initial millimetres, must be taken into account in MOSFET output. Conclusions: Dose distributions knowledge in IORT breast treatment with thin layers has been improved after the combined actions of in vivo dosimetry and Monte Carlo simulations.",,0

METHODS: The Monte Carlo MCNP5 code was used to simulate dose rate in the PTV of a 2 cm radius MammoSite balloon dose delivery system. The simulations were carried out using an average female chest phantom (AFCP) and a semi-infinite water phantom for both Yb-169 and Ir-192 high dose rate sources for brachytherapy application. Gastrografin was introduced at varying concentrations to study the effect of contrast material on the dose rate in the PTV. RESULTS: The effect of the density of the materials surrounding the MammoSite balloon containing 0% contrast material on the calculated dose rate at different radial distances in the PTV was demonstrated. Within the PTV, the ratio of the calculated dose rate for the AFCP and the semi-infinite water phantom for the point closest to the breast-air interface (90 degrees) is less than that for the point closest to the breast-lung interface (270 degrees) by 11.4% and 4% for the HDR sources of Yb-169 and Ir-192, respectively. When contrast material was introduced into the 2 cm radius MammoSite balloon at varying concentrations, (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), the dose rate in the AFCP at 3.0 cm radial distance at 90 degrees was decreased by as much as 14.8% and 6.2% for Yb-169 and Ir-192, respectively, when compared to that of the semi-infinite water phantom with contrast concentrations of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Commercially available software used to calculate dose rate in the PTV of a MammoSite balloon needs to account for patient anatomy and density of surrounding materials in the dosimetry analyses in order to avoid patient underdose.",eng,0

Patients were divided based on IORT performance and stratified by age (>48 or <48 years). Data were analyzed using R (version 2.15.2), considering a level of significance at P<0.05. Among the 247 eligible patients, 81 accepted the IORT protocol. Intraoperative IORT feasibility was 95.1% (77/81). In 71.4% (55/77) of the cases no postoperative complication was registered. Concerning local recurrence and overall survival, no significant difference was observed between women who underwent the IORT protocol or standard treatment. Among the patients aged <48 years, no local recurrence was noted after IORT protocol, and among women aged >48, local recurrences developed later in patients treated with IORT than with standard treatment. IORT represents a feasible and promising technique for the treatment of early breast cancer, with low morbidity, and beneficial aesthetic and oncologic results.

The aim of the study was to estimate tolerance and efficacy IORT with whole breast irradiation after breast-conserving treatment. Material and Methods: Between 2003 and 2004, 112 patients with early stage breast cancer (T1-2, N0-1) were treated in Center of Oncology Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Institute, Branch Gliwice in Poland. All patients had breast conservative treatment (wide tumor excision with regional lymph nodes) followed by Intraoperative Radiotherapy using Low-Energy X Rays. The total dose was 5-7.5Gy and was specifed 0.5 cm depth from tumor bed. After surgery patients received external beam radiation therapy to the whole breast. The total dose was 50Gy delivered in 25 fractions. The radiotherapy included also regional lymph nodes if pathological stage was classified as N+. Acute and late toxicity of treatment was evaluated according to RTOG/EORTC criteria. The evaluation of normal tissue early reactions included also the analysis of wound healing time. A Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves. Results: Extended wound healing time after operation with IORT was the most frequent and occured in 16% of patients. Wound infection was observed in 15%, fistula or necrosis in 10% and hematoma in tumor bed in 9% of patients. 66 patients (59%) developed Grade I, 12 patients (11%) Grade II and 17 patients (15%) Grade III early skin toxicity. Late skin toxicity in Grade I was observed in 31 patients, Grade II developed 9 patients. Late toxicity from subcutaneous tissues in Grade I, II, III properly developed 56 (50%) patients, 8 patients (7%) and 1 patient (1%). The median follow up was 5 years. 5-year disease free survival was in 88%. In 3 patients (2%) occurred local recurrence. Distant metastases occurred in 7 patients (6%). Conclusions: The results of the study have shown that IORT with whole breast conventional radiotherapy after conservative treatment in early stage breast cancer was well tolerated.

In planning autologous reconstructions, preoperative assessment of donor site microvascular anatomy with advanced imaging modalities has assisted in the appropriate selection of flap donor site, individual perforators, and lead to an overall improvement in flap outcomes. In this review, we compare the accuracy of fluorescent angiography, computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and their impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: A review of the published English literature dating from 1950 to 2015 using databases, such as PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and EMBASE was undertaken. RESULTS: Fluorescent angiography is technically limited by its inability to evaluate deep-lying perforators and hence, it has a minimal role in the preoperative setting. However, it may be useful intraoperatively in evaluating microvascular anastomotic patency and the mastectomy skin perfusion. CTA is currently widely considered the standard, due to its high accuracy and reliability. Multiple studies have demonstrated its ability to improve clinical outcomes, such as operative length and flap complications. However, concerns surrounding exposure to radiation and nephrotoxic contrast agents exist. MRA has been explored, however despite recent advances, the image quality of MRA is considered inferior to CTA. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative imaging is an essential component in planning autologous breast reconstruction. Fluorescent angiography presents minimal role as a preoperative imaging modality, but may be a useful intraoperative adjunct to assess the anastomosis and the mastectomy skin perfusion. Currently, CTA is the gold standard preoperatively. MRA has a role, particularly for women of younger age, iodine allergy, and renal impairment.",eng,0

Surgical principles have shifted away from the Halstedian concept of radical surgery towards more cosmetic breast-conserving procedures, and advances have been made in terms of oncologic and plastic surgical techniques for those opting for mastectomy and reconstruction. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has revolutionized the evaluation of patients' nodal status and has become widely accepted as state of the art."" Medical oncology has made tremendous advances and is no longer relegated to the patients with metastatic disease. It is well accepted that chemotherapy may play a role even in patients with small tumors. Certainly the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for downsizing tumors and making them amenable for breast conservation is also widely accepted. The advent of anthracyclines and, more recently, taxane-based regimens has had a substantial impact on the management of breast cancer. In addition, newer hormonal therapies such as the aromatase inhibitors have rivaled the classic cornerstone of tamoxifen. Radiation therapy has evolved from the era of cobalt-based therapy to newer, less morbid, techniques. In addition to advances in external beam radiation, the concept of accelerated partial breast irradiation and intraoperative radiation therapy is evolving and continues to be the focus of research endeavors. The unparalleled advances in the management of breast cancer in the fields of surgical, medical, and radiation oncology over the last half century continue today with ongoing research and clinical trials. As we enter the new millennium, breast cancer management will continue to evolve.""",,0

Given the ramifications of PMRT for immediate reconstruction, we sought to create a model using preoperative and intraoperative factors to predict which patients with a positive sentinel lymph node will have less than four LN+. METHODS: The database from a prospective multicenter study of 4,131 patients was used for this analysis. Patients with one to three positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and tumors < 5 cm (n = 1,133) in size were randomly divided into a training set (n = 580) and a test set (n = 553). Multivariate logistic regression was used on the training set to create a prediction rule that was subsequently validated in the test set. RESULTS: Median patient age was 57 (range, 27-100) years, and median tumor size was 2.0 (range, 0.2-4.8) cm. In the training set, factors associated with having four or more LN+ on multivariate analysis were: tumor size [odds ratio (OR) = 2.087; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.307-3.333, P = 0.002), number of positive SLN (P < 0.0005), and proportion of positive SLN (OR = 3.602; 95% CI: 2.100-6.179, P < 0.005). A predictive model was established with a point assigned to each positive SLN, T2 (vs. T1), and if proportion of positive SLN was > 50%, for a maximum of five points. In both the training and test sets, patients with one point had a low probability of having four or more LN+ (3.8% and 3.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Tumor size, number of positive SLN, and the proportion of positive SLN influence whether patients will have four or more LN+.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Planning CT data sets of 15 patients with left breast cancer receiving multicatheter brachytherapy post breast conserving surgery were used to create two independent treatment plans - WBEBRT prescribed to 50 Gy/25 fractions and MCABPI prescribed to 34 Gy/10 fractions. Dose parameters for (i) LAD artery, (ii) heart, and (iii) ipsilateral lung were calculated and compared between the two treatment modalities. RESULTS: After adjusting for Equivalent Dose in 2 Gy fractions(EQD2), and comparing MCAPBI with WBEBRT, the largest dose reduction was for the LAD artery whose mean dose differed by a factor of 7.7, followed by the ipsilateral lung and heart with a factor of 4.6 and 2.6 respectively. Compared to WBEBRT, the mean MCAPBI LAD was significantly lower compared to WBEBRT (6.0 Gy vs 45.9 Gy; p<0.01). Mean MCAPBI heart D(0.1cc) (representing the dose received by the most highly exposed 0.1 cc of the risk organ, i.e. the dose peak) was significantly lower (16.3 Gy vs 50.6 Gy; p<0.01). Likewise, the mean heart dose (MHD) was significantly lower (2.3 Gy vs 6.0 Gy; p<0.01). Peak dose and mean lung dose (MLD) for ipsilateral lung was also lower for MCAPBI compared to WBEBRT (Peak dose: 22.2 Gy vs 52.0 Gy; p<0.01; MLD: 2.3 Gy vs 10.7 Gy; p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared to WBEBRT, MCAPBI showed a significant reduction in radiation dose for the LAD, heart and lung.

Our study aims to identify risk factors for flap loss and to assess whether different salvage techniques affect flap salvage. We performed a retrospective review of all breast free flaps performed at a single institution from 2000 to 2010. Overall, 2138 flaps were performed in 1608 patients (unilateral, 1120 and bilateral, 488) with 44 flap losses (2.1%). Age, body mass index, smoking, radiation, chemotherapy, and surgeon experience did not affect flap loss. Abdominal flaps based on a single perforator were at significantly higher risk for flap loss compared with flaps based on multiple perforators (P = 0.0007). Subgroup analysis of the subset of 166 compromised free flaps (flaps requiring a return to the operating room, an intraoperative anastomotic revision, or loss/partial loss of a free flap) demonstrated deep inferior epigastric perforator, and other flaps (superficial inferior epigastric artery and superior gluteal artery perforator) were significantly associated with flap loss [odds ratio (OR) 5.20; P = 0.03 and OR 6.91; P = 0.0004, respectively] compared with transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous and muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps. Although an intraoperative complication was not associated with a flap loss, the need for a reoperation was strongly predictive (P < 0.0001). Flap salvage was the highest within the first 24 hours (83.7%) and significantly less between days 1 and 3 (38.6%; P < 0.0001) and beyond 4 days (29.4%; P < 0.0001). Longer ischemia time was significantly associated with flap loss (P = 0.04). Salvage techniques (aspirin, heparinzation, thrombectomy, and thrombolytic) had no impact on flap salvage rates. Heparinization and thrombolytics were associated with higher loss rates (OR 3.40; P = 0.003 and OR 10.36; P < 0.0001, respectively). Free flap loss following breast reconstruction is multifactorial with higher losses in superficial inferior epigastric artery and gluteal flaps, single-perforator abdominal flaps, and longer ischemia times. Salvage rates are most successful within the first 24 hours, and the use of heparinization, aspirin, and thrombolytics does not improve salvage rates.",eng,0

We examined femur fractures occurring in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates (IVBP) to determine whether a subset may be atypical fractures. METHODS: Between 2005 and 2010, we identified patients with known IVBP therapy for multiple myeloma or metastatic breast cancer, who subsequently sustained a femur fracture based on hospitalization, oncology, pharmacy and chemotherapy visit records. Radiographs were examined by an orthopedic surgeon to determine anatomic fracture site and pattern. An atypical fracture was defined as a transverse or short oblique fracture occurring below the lesser trochanter with evidence of focal hypertrophy of the lateral cortex and absence of biopsy-proven malignancy or radiation therapy at the fracture site. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients with breast cancer (N=39) or multiple myeloma (N=23) with femur fracture and prior IVBP treatment for bone malignancy were identified. There were 30 proximal hip, 18 subtrochanteric and 14 femoral shaft fractures. Intraoperative bone samples were sent in 29 of 58 fracture cases undergoing operative repair, with 76% positive for malignancy. Six cases (4 breast cancer, 2 multiple myeloma) of atypical femur fracture were identified, two with negative intraoperative pathology and four with no bone biopsy samples sent. Five of the six patients with atypical fracture had bilateral femur findings, including two with transverse fracture in the contralateral femur and three with focal hypertrophy of the contralateral cortex. Two atypical fracture cases also experienced osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to 3 in the remaining cohort (33% vs. 5%, p=0.07). Patients with atypical fracture received more IVBP (median 55 vs. 15 doses) and zoledronic acid (32 vs. 12 doses) and had longer treatment duration (median 5.9 vs. 1.6 years) compared to patients without atypical fracture (all p</=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among 62 patients who received IVBP for skeletal malignancy and experienced a femur fracture, we identified six cases of atypical fracture. While fractures in this population are often assumed to be pathologic, prospective studies investigating fracture pattern, microscopic bone pathology and pharmacologic exposures should be conducted to further examine the association of IVBP and atypical femur fractures.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From January 2000 to April 2006, 80 patients treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) received adjuvant radiation using the MammoSite (34 Gy in 3.4-Gy fractions prescribed to 1.0 cm from the balloon surface). Twenty-three patients (29%) had Stage 0 breast cancer, 46 (57%) had Stage I breast cancer, and 11 (14%) had Stage II breast cancer. The median follow-up was 22.1 months. RESULTS: Two ipsilateral breast-tumor recurrences (IBTRs) (2.5%) developed for a 3-year actuarial rate of 2.9% (no regional failures were observed). On molecular-based clonality assay evaluation, both recurrences were clonally related. Younger age at diagnosis was the only variable associated with IBTR (continuous variable, p = 0.044; categorical variable [<55 years vs. >/=55 years], p = 0.012). The percentages of patients with good/excellent cosmetic results at 12 and 36 months were 96.9% and 88.2%, respectively (p = NS). Patients with applicator-to-skin spacing <7 mm and those who received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy exhibited lower rates of good/excellent cosmetic results, though the association was not statistically significant. The overall incidence of symptomatic seromas and any seromas was 10% and 45%, respectively. The overall incidence of fat necrosis and infections was 8.8% and 11.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Early-stage breast-cancer patients treated with adjuvant APBI using the MammoSite catheter exhibited a 3-year treatment efficacy, cosmesis, and toxicity similar to those observed with other forms of interstitial APBI at this length of follow-up.",eng,0

The dosimetric feasibility for single fraction ablative radiotherapy was evaluated by comparing volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with an interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy (IMB) approach. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumors of 20 patients with early-stage breast cancer were delineated on a preoperative contrast-enhanced planning CT-scan, co-registered with a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both in radiotherapy supine position. A dose of 15 Gy was prescribed to the planned target volume of the clinical target volume (PTVCTV), and 20 Gy integrated boost to the PTV of the gross tumor volume (PTVGTV). Treatment plans for IMB and VMAT were optimized for adequate target volume coverage and minimal organs at risk (OAR) dose. RESULTS: The median PTVGTV/CTV receiving at least 95% of the prescribed dose was 99% with both techniques. The median PTVCTV unintentionally receiving 95% of the prescribed PTVGTV dose was 65.4% and 4.3% with IMB and VMAT, respectively. OAR doses were comparable with both techniques. CONCLUSION: MRI-guided single fraction radiotherapy with an integrated ablative boost to the GTV is dosimetrically feasible with both techniques. We perceive IMB less suitable for clinical implementation due to PTVCTV overdosage. Future studies have to confirm the clinical feasibility of the single fraction ablative approach.",eng,0

Thompson,2009.0,Effect of postoperative radiotherapy on autologous deep inferior epigastric perforator flap volume after immediate breast reconstruction,10.1002/bjs.6693,BACKGROUND: The effect of postoperative radiotherapy following autologous flap breast reconstruction is controversial. The aim of this study was to measure whether adjuvant radiotherapy following immediate deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) free flap breast reconstruction affected flap volume. METHODS: Sixty-eight women underwent immediate autologous DIEP flap reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer. Twenty-two of the 68 received postoperative radiotherapy (45Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks). Intraoperative flap volume data were collected prospectively. Volumetric assessment was carried out a minimum of 1 year after surgery. Patients who had volume adjustment surgery after initial reconstruction were analysed separately. RESULTS: The mean age of the women was 52 (range 37-69) years and median follow-up was 3.5 (range 1-10) years. There was no statistically significant difference in volume change between patients who had and those who did not have postreconstruction radiotherapy for the whole cohort (median reduction 65 versus 0 ml) or when women who had undergone further volume adjustment surgery were excluded. CONCLUSION: In this study postoperative radiotherapy did not significantly affect breast volume after DIEP flap reconstruction. The potential need for postoperative radiotherapy should not deter women from undergoing immediate DIEP flap breast reconstruction.,eng,0

Previous studies of APBI using intraoperative radiation therapy or balloon brachytherapy have demonstrated high risks of seroma formation. This is an analysis of predictors of seroma formation with use of preoperative APBI. Materials/Methods: Between August 2010 and September 2012, 23 patients with stage I/IIA breast cancer were treated with pre-operative APBI followed by breast conserving surgery. Patients were treated according to NSABP B-39 guidelines on an IRB approved protocol. Seromas were diagnosed clinically and were considered symptomatic upon patient report of breast discomfort or pain. Patients were compared according to seroma formation (yes vs no) using nonparametric Wilcoxon and the Fisher Exact tests, as appropriate, on demographic and clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, BMI, smoking status, tumor laterality, tumor quadrant, use of chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, distance between tumor and skin, pathologic specimen volume, and re-excision status. Dosimetric characteristics included GTV, PTV-Eval, whole breast volume (WBV), PTV/WBV, V20, V40, V60, V80, V100, and V110 for breast and skin, and beam energy. Independent predictors of seroma formation were assessed using Cox Proportional Hazards regression modeling. Results: Of 23 patients, 14 developed a seroma. Symptomatic seromas were present in 11 patients (48%). Nine patients underwent at least one aspiration for symptomatic seroma. The first aspiration was non-infectious in each case. One patient developed an abscess after multiple aspirations. Four patients with a seroma had radiation recall reactions, after initiating an aromatase inhibitor (n=3), and chemotherapy (n=1). The median time to seroma resolution was 186.5 days (range, 35-270 days). On univariate analysis, none of the factors evaluated as predictors for seroma achieved statistical significance. Although surgical specimen volume was not predictive for seroma formation (median: 260 cc, p=0.59), larger surgical volumes were more likely symptomatic (p=0.06). There were no symptomatic seromas <260 cc. On multivariate analysis, higher PTV-WBV%, history of smoking, and left laterality were independent predictors of seroma formation (p=0.03, 0.04, and 0.01, respectively). Conclusions: In our analysis, rates of seroma formation were similar to the existing literature. Larger surgical specimens and larger PTV/WBV appeared to increase seroma formation confirming the importance of appropriate patient selection.",,0

From February 2005 at the Citt Castello Hospital and from January 2009 at the Foligno Hospital is made intraoperative radiotherapy with a movable linac NOVAC 7 (electron energies from 3 to 9 MeV) in Citt Castello and with LIAC (electron energies from 3 to 12 MeV) in Foligno. Materials: We performed a total of 438 IORT of these 343 breast cancer, 107 patients were treated with IORT exclusively with one 21 Gy fraction prescribed at 90% isodose. These showed the following characteristics: age > 60 years, pT 2.5 cm and pN0, ductal invasive unifocal carcinoma, and tumor-free margin of >10 mm. In the other 226 patients the IORT was used as tumor bed boost with dose of 10 Gy, followed by 44-50 Gy whole-breast external-beam radiotherapy, in 16-25 fractions respectively. in vivo dosimetry has been carried out both by radiocromic films and diodes. We treated 17 patients with gastric cancer, not submitted to neoadjuvant treatment, 25 patient with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemo- radiotherapy 17 tumors of the pancreas treated in 10 cases with palliative intent and 7 cases with curative intent, the doses used were ranged from 10 to 20 Gy.We also conducted 11 patients with soft tissue sarcoma, 22 patients with prostate cancer with a dose of 18 or 20 Gy. Results: We evaluated 175 breast cancer with a follow-up of at least than 12 months: 131 treated with IORT as anticipated boost and 44 were treated with IORT alone. For the 131 cancer treated with boost the median follow-up was 35 months. We observed a local recurrence and lymph node recurrence and one patient developed metastases. For 44 patients treated with IORT alone, the median follow-up was 33 months To date there has been only one local recurrence outside the quadrant of the primary tumor. There have been no serious surgical or radiation complications. After follow-up of at least than 12 months, no patients with prostate cancer and rectal cancer developed a local relapse. No other long-term complications occurred. Conclusions: Our experience with IORT with movable linac suggests that this technique is feasible, user friendly, and might be an appropriate treatment for selected patients. IORT the accurate localization tumor bed, minimizes the damage to the normal tissue. Results in terms of local control are very encouraging, but need to be confirmed by longer follow-up.",,0

METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 422 breast cancer patients undergoing BCS with intraoperative CM assessment. After an initial lumpectomy with intent to obtain >/=1-cm margins, separate specimens 1 x 1 cm, 0.5-cm thick were taken from the cavity margin circumferentially. These were frozen without reference to the side of the new margin as a time-saving measure, and parallel sections of the resected surface were evaluated. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 55.5 months, a cumulative 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival rate of 95.3%, metastasis-free survival rate of 97.8%, disease-free survival rate of 88.3%, and overall survival rate of 96.0%, was achieved. The CM positivity rates were of no statistical difference when <7, 7-8, and >8 CMs were assessed. The second operation rate was 3.5% because of the false-negative results of the frozen section analysis on CMs. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that a higher pN stage and cT stage as well as a lack of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation demonstrated significantly worse clinical outcomes. Locoregional recurrences and metastasis are both correlated with worse overall survival. The number of the CMs assessed was not associated with clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The modified CM assessment presented here is a rapid, accurate, and oncologically safe approach for margin evaluation in BCS patients. Lumpectomy margin assessment might be spared when this method is used.",eng,0

Electronic brachytherapy may further reduce barriers to breast conserving therapy by making APBI more available. However, its toxicity profile is not well characterized. Methods and Materials: A 60-year-old woman was treated with APBI using Axxent (Xoft, Sunnyvale, CA) electronic brachytherapy. One month after APBI, a cycle of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide was given. Within 3 weeks, the patient developed an ulcerative radiation recall reaction in the skin overlying the lumpectomy cavity. To investigate this toxicity, the skin dose from electronic brachytherapy was compared with the dose that would have been delivered by an iridium-192 (<sup>192</sup>Ir) source. Additionally, a dose equivalent was estimated by adjusting for the increased relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of low energy photons generated by the electronic source. Results: Using electronic brachytherapy, the skin dose was 537 cGy per fraction compared with 470 cGy for an <sup>192</sup>Ir source. Given an RBE for a 40 kV source of 1.28 compared with <sup>192</sup>Ir, the equivalent dose at the skin for an electronic source was 687 cGy-equivalents, a 46% increase. Conclusions: We present a case of an ulcerative radiation recall reaction in a patient receiving APBI with electronic brachytherapy followed by chemotherapy. Our analysis shows that the use of electronic brachytherapy resulted in the deposition of significantly higher equivalent dose at the skin compared with <sup>192</sup>Ir. These findings suggest that standard guidelines (e.g., surface-to-skin distance) that apply to <sup>192</sup>Ir-based balloon brachytherapy may not be applicable to electronic brachytherapy. © 2009 American Brachytherapy Society.",,0

Das,2005.0,Dose perturbations due to contrast medium and air in mammosite treatment: an experimental and Monte Carlo study,10.1118/1.1943827,"In the management of early breast cancer, a partial breast irradiation technique called MammoSite (Proxima Therapeutic Inc., Alpharetta, GA) has been advocated in recent years. In MammoSite, a balloon implanted at the surgical cavity during tumor excision is filled with a radio-opaque solution, and radiation is delivered via a high dose rate brachytherapy source situated at the center of the balloon. Frequently air may be introduced during placement of the balloon and/or injection of the contrast solution into the balloon. The purpose of this work is to quantify as well as to understand dose perturbations due to the presence of a high-Z contrast medium and/or an air bubble with measurements and Monte Carlo calculations. In addition, the measured dose distribution is compared with that obtained from a commercial treatment planning system (Nucletron PLATO system). For a balloon diameter of 42 mm, the dose variation as a function of distance from the balloon surface is measured for various concentrations of a radio-opaque solution (in the range 5%-25% by volume) with a small volume parallel plate ion chamber and a micro-diode detector placed perpendicular to the balloon axis. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to provide a basic understanding of the interaction mechanism and the magnitude of dose perturbation at the interface near balloon surface. Our results show that the radio-opaque concentration produces dose perturbation up to 6%. The dose perturbation occurs mostly within the distances <1 mm from the balloon surface. The Plato system that does not include heterogeneity correction may be sufficient for dose planning at distances > or = 10 mm from the balloon surface for the iodine concentrations used in the MammoSite procedures. The dose enhancement effect near the balloon surface (<1 mm) due to the higher iodine concentration is not correctly predicted by the Plato system. The dose near the balloon surface may be increased by 0.5% per cm3 of air. Monte Carlo simulation suggests that the interface effect (enhanced dose near surface) is primarily due to Compton electrons of short range (<0.5 mm). For more accurate dosimetry in MammoSite delivery, the dose perturbation due to the presence of a radio-opaque contrast medium and air bubbles should be considered in a brachytherapy planning system.",eng,0

Similarly, Deep Vein Thromboembolism (VTE) is another risk factor for subsequent cancer development. This case presentation highlights a 70 yo female patient who developed reactivation of VZV as well as DVT and subsequently was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. A 70 yo female was seen in our geriatric clinic presenting with a 3 week history of rash on her lower lip. She was subsequently diagnosed with shingles involving the right V3 nerve. During her hospitalization, she was treated with IV Acyclovir. Her recovery was significant for post-herpetic pain. In a follow up clinic visit patient was noted to have painful right leg swelling and subsequently diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis. Patient recalled that leg symptoms had initially started with the onset of her facial rash. Although she noted less activity, patient denied being bed bound. She was started on Coumadin anticoagulation. Within 1 month after facial rash development, patient was seen for routine screening mammogram and noted to have microcalcifications- biopsy confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ. Prior case studies have depicted a similar progression from zoster to malignancy, particularly hematological cancers. Herpes zoster has also been implicated in some cases of lymphoma, pseudolymphoma, angiosarcoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Recent studies have also identified herpes zoster as a risk factor for stroke and transient ischemic attacks. A study in 2013 demonstrated correlation between zoster and a subsequent diagnosis of cancer in all age groups. It also noted markedly large incidences in the first 90 days following diagnosis and in patients over the age of 65 years. Our patient was successfully surgically treated with lumpectomy with intraoperative radiation and sentinel lymph node sampling. This unique presentation of reactivation of VZV and concurrent DVT development, both known independent risk factors for malignancy, in a 70 female subsequently diagnosed with early stage breast cancer suggests a likely cumulative effect for increased risk for malignancy.

Methodology: A retrospective chart review was performed on 21 women with stage I or II breast cancer who underwent breast conserving treatment (BCT) with lumpectomy or quadrantectomy, axillary lymph node dissection and IORT boost from 1984-1999 at the University of Toledo Medical Center. The electron beam was directed to the tumor bed through the surgical incision with a sterile applicator and IORT was delivered as a single fraction. Patients then received the conventional course of post-operative external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) after adequate wound healing. Adjuvant chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy followed when indicated. Results: Eighteen Caucasian and 3 African-American patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated with IORT as part of their BCT between 1984-1999. Median age was 60 years (Range: 37-72). Seventeen patients were Stage I, 3 were Stage IIA, and one was Stage IIB. Nineteen patients were diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, one patient had mucinous carcinoma, and one patient had medullary carcinoma. Nineteen patients received 10 Gy for their IORT boost, with 3 patients receiving 15 Gy. Patients were treated with adjuvant EBRT with 45-46.8 Gy in 23-26 fractions of 1.8 Gy for a median total dose of 55 Gy (Range: 55-61 Gy). Median interval between IORT and EBRT was 27 days (Range: 12-124 days). One patient experienced post-operative mastitis which was treated with IV antibiotics; no other patients experienced any surgical complications. Median follow-up is 10 years (Range: 1-21 years). All patients had Acceptable"" to ""Excellent"" cosmetic results in follow-up. One patient developed a second breast cancer in the contralateral breast and another was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the treated breast. No patients experienced a recurrence of their treated breast cancer. Three patients with right-sided breast cancers have since died due to cardiac causes and one patient died due to complications of multiple myeloma which was diagnosed after completing BCT. Ten-year overall and disease-specific survival is 81.2% and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: IORT offers advantages including accurate and precise delivery of radiation to the tumor bed and improved sparing of surrounding normal breast tissues including the skin. Most importantly, long-term results of our series indicate excellent survival with no recurrences and minimal complications compared to recurrence rates of 8-10% in patients treated with conventional therapy.""",,0

This technique, commonly used for breast irradiations, presents two main advantages: better targeting of tumor cells and drastic reduction of total treatment time. For the same reasons, prostate bed IORT should be an interesting alternative of External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT). Homogeneous breast composition leads to a uniform irradiation of targeted tissues around applicator. On the contrary,pelvic area is composed of various tissues and organs, such as rectum, bladder,urethra, symphysis, etc. Accurate 3D dose distribution must be calculated to evaluate the feasibility of IORT in prostate bed. The aim of this work was to adapt and validate a Monte Carlo (MC) model of the INTRABEAM system for the study of IORT in prostate bed. Materials and Methods: The Gate (v6.2) MC model of INTRABEAM was adapted from Bouzid et al. [Phys. Med. (40) 2013]. Mathematical model was validated in water for X-Ray Source (XRS) and three spherical applicators (4cm,4.5cm and 5cm), by comparing simulations with theoretical data. Using this model, a Phase-Space File (PSF) was created at the surface of the 5cm applicator to be used with voxelized geometry, as CT images. Validation of MC dosimetric calculation in pelvic area was based on comparison between absolute dose simulation and measurements with EBT3 Gafchromic films placed in areas of interest in a cadaver (rectum, bundle, bladder, urethra and symphysis). 20Gy were delivered at the surface of applicator. A 2D gamma analysis was made using a local gamma criterion of 5%-1mm and 10%-1mm. Distance to agreement (1mm) and dose (5% and10%) criteria were adapted from EBRT (3mm to 5mm, 3% to 5%) to take into account the high dose gradient at low energy range and the statistical uncertainties. Results: MC dose distribution in water was closed to theoretical data for XRS and spherical applicators with a maximal discrepancy about 3%. PSF scored from mathematical geometry can be used in voxelized geometry. No significant differences were observed between mathematical and voxelized geometry in water. In vivo measurements and simulations presented heterogeneous dose distributions of about [21-4Gy] for rectum, [22-8Gy] for bundle, [11-4Gy] for bladder, [22-13Gy] for urethra and [3-0Gy] for symphysis. Gamma analysis gave a range of percent of pixel failed for 5%-1mm and 10%-1mm criterion about [36%-9%] and [10%- 0.1%] respectively. In vivo validation yielded satisfactory results taking into account the difficulty to accurately extract EBT3 planes from CT images and the high dose gradient. Conclusions: Our specific MC-based dosimetric environment was validated in clinical conditions. This tool is able to provide 3D accurate dose distribution and dose-volume histogram (DVH) from CT images allowing the dosimetric evaluation of IORT in prostate cancer with INTRABEAM system.

Materials and Methods: One limiting factor in MammoSite balloon brachytherapy is the unacceptable high dose to the skin for balloon- lumpectomy geometries in which there is inadequate separation between the balloon surface and the skin. The SenoRx ConturaTM applicator because of the multi-lumen design (5 catheters, 4 offset 5mm from the central lumen) introduces additional dosimetric flexibility that can allow dose shaping to achieve better target conformality while reducing the dose to adjacent normal structures such as the skin and the chest wall. For the single lumen MammoSite applicator, RTOG B39 protocol recommends a minimal balloon surface-skin distance of >7 mm. However, the ConturaTM MLB applicator may not require this restriction. We examined the impact of balloon orientation on the target dose coverage and normal tissue sparing achieved in 3 patients who received ConturaTM MLB brachytherapy at our center. We applied the guidelines and dose volume objectives from the RTOG B39 protocol to outline volumes of interest and evaluate the implant quality. Three cases were analyzed: MBL case 1: balloon close to skin surface <10 mm and balloon surface-rib >10mm; MBL case 2: balloon and Rib close to skin surface <10 mm; and, MLB case 3: balloon well spaced between skin and rib > 10 mm. Plans were optimized on the Nucletron Oncentra brachytherapy treatment planning system (Nucletron B.V., Veenendaal, The Netherlands) utilizing inverse planning by simulated annealing (IPSA) module. Results: Figure 1 presents the three cases of balloon orientations analyzed showing the MLB in the lumpectomy cavity, the PTV-EVAL and the isodose distribution obtained from IPSA optimization. The resulting corresponding dose volume statistics are given in Table 1, labeled MLB case 1, MLB case 2, and MLB case 3, respectively; compared with dose objectives tolerance values from RTOG B39 for the single lumen MammoSite balloon. For MLB case 1, the D<inf>90</inf> = 98.63%, D<inf>95</inf> = 96.61%, and D<inf>100</inf> = 90.89%. The V<inf>150</inf> = 29.37cc and V<inf>200</inf> = 2.73 cc and the skin and rib doses are 95% of prescribed dose. Both the target dose coverage and normal tissue dose volumes meet exceed the B39 tolerance values. For MLB case 2, the target dose coverage was D90 = 98.75%, D<inf>95</inf> = 96.24%, and D<inf>100</inf> = 90.61%. The normal tissue dose volumes were V<inf>150</inf> = 28.41cc, V<inf>200</inf> = 4.34cc. The maximum skin and rib dose was 145% of prescribed dose to a limited area. PTV-EVAL meets and exceeds the B39 target dose coverage but barely satisfies the skin dose objective. Attempts to reduce the skin dose below 145% resulted in reduced target dose coverage. In MLB case 3, D<inf>90</inf> = 99.61%, D<inf>95</inf> = 98.16%, D<inf>100</inf> = 91.5%. V<inf>150</inf> = 29.59cc, and V<inf>200</inf> = 2.63cc. Both target dose coverage and normal tissue dose volumes are excellent and exceed the B39 dose objectives. Conclusions: The results confirm that the ConturaTM MLB can achieve target dose coverage of D<inf>95</inf>>95% and normal tissue sparing of V<inf>150</inf>< 30cc and V<inf>200</inf><5cc for a wide range of implant geometry in which the balloon surface-skin/rib distance is >10mm. The skin and rib doses can be kept below 125% of prescribed dose. In cases where both the skin and the chest wall are very close to the balloon surface (<10 mm) however, the maximum target volume coverage may not be achieved without violating the normal tissue dose volume objectives.",,0

Montgomery,2010.0,Initial experience with the ConturaTM multi-lumen balloon applicator for accelerated partial breast irradiation: Analysis of dose volume parameters,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&AN=70150366","Purpose: The clinical efficacy of SenoRx Conturax multi-lumen balloon applicator for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has been established. The applicator eliminates many limitations associated with the single-lumen MammoSite balloon, i.e., patient eligibility due to inadequate balloon surface-to-skin distance, tissue-balloon conformance, and balloon symmetry. We report our initial clinical experience of using this applicator with emphasis on analysis of dose volume parameters associated with implant quality in balloon brachytherapy. Materials and Methods: At our institution, a total of 20 patients have been treated with the SenoRx multi-lumen balloon applicator. A 4-5 cc size SenoRx balloon was surgically placed in the lumpectomy cavity and inflated with saline diluted with contrast. A vacuum port provided with the applicator was routinely used to remove air/fluid surrounding the balloon ensuring maximum skin-balloon conformance. CT images were acquired on a GE LightSpeed scanner and sent to Nucletron Oncentra 3D inverse treatment planning system (Nucletron B.V., Veenendaal, The Netherlands). Following the B39 protocol, a planning target volume (PTV) was outlined and modified to create PTV-EVAL which represents a 1 cm rind of tissue around the balloon. For each patient, an optimized 3D plan was created, DVH computed, and then evaluated with respect to meeting planning objectives for target volume coverage of D<inf>90</inf> > 90%, normal tissue volume parameters of V<inf>150</inf> <50 cc, V<inf>200</inf> <10 cc and skin and rib dose not exceeding 125% of 340 cGy prescribed dose at any point. Treatment was delivered with a Nucletron V2 remote afterloading unit (Nucletron B.V., Veenendaal, The Netherlands) with a high activity <sup>192</sup>Ir source at 340 cGy, twice a day for 5 days. We examined the relative ease and or difficult of achieving an acceptable plan based on the location of balloon in the breast and the adjacent constraining normal tissue structures. Results: The median balloon size was 54.96 cc (range: 43-63 cc), the median distance separating the skin from PTV-EVAL was 4 mm (range: 2-14 mm), and the median closest distance between lung and PTV-EVAL was 9.7 mm (range: 3-52 mm) as measured from axial CT images. All plans met and exceeded the target volume coverage objective of D<inf>90</inf> > 90% (percent of prescribed dose covering 90% of PTV), regardless of balloon location in the breast and the distance separating the skin or rib from the PTV-EVAL. The median D<inf>90</inf> coverage was 99.3% (range: 91.7-100%). The median maximum skin dose of 100% of prescribed dose with a range of 10-105% was achieved in 95% of implants without violating other objectives. One case in which the skin and the chestwall were very close to the PTV-EVAL, 2mm and 3mm respectively, a maximum skin dose of 110% was achieved in order to maintain acceptable target volume coverage. The median V<inf>150</inf> (normal tissue volume receiving 150% prescribed dose) was 28.6 cc (range: 15.6-36.7 cc). The median V200 (normal tissue volume receiving 200% of prescribed dose) was 4.5 cc (range: 1-9.6 cc). Conclusions: Dose volume parameters presented here confirm findings of other investigators that balloon brachytherapy with the SenoRx Conturax applicator results in better target dose coverage with acceptable doses to adjacent skin and lung tissues. In general, however, there is a tradeoff between maximum target coverage and normal tissue sparing that can be achieved depending on the relative location of the balloon in the breast and the adjacent constraining normal tissue structures. Also, our experience showed that more time was required to generate an acceptable plan if the skin and the chestwall were very close to the PTV-EVAL.",,0

We improved the PTV coverage by varying multiple dwell positions and weights. We assumed that the diameter of spherical balloons varied from 4.0 cm to 5.0 cm, that the PTV was a 1-cm thick spherical shell over the balloon (reduced by the small portion occupied by the catheter path), and that the number of dwell positions varied from 2 to 13 with 0.25-cm steps, oriented symmetrically with respect to the balloon center. By assuming that the perfect PTV coverage can be achieved by spherical dose distributions from an isotropic source, we developed an optimization program to minimize two objective functions defined as: (1) the number of PTV-voxels having more than 10% difference between optimized doses and spherical doses, and (2) the difference between optimized doses and spherical doses per PTV-voxel. The optimal PTV coverage occurred when applying 8-11 dwell positions with weights determined by the optimization scheme. Since the optimization yields ellipsoidal isodose distributions along the catheter, there is relative skin sparing for cases with source movement approximately tangent to the skin. We also verified the optimization in CT-based treatment planning systems. Our volumetric dose optimization for PTV coverage showed close agreement to linear or multiple-points optimization results from the literature. The optimization scheme provides a simple and practical solution applicable to the clinic.",,0

The current article describes the largest series of patients in United States undergoing liver resective therapy with the use of microwave technology for liver precoagulation. Glisson's capsule was incised after securing inflow and outflow control. Two antennae, 2 cm apart, connected to a 915-MHz generator, were inserted 5 cm into liver parenchyma at a 130 degrees angle. Once the parenchyma was firm and changed its color to gray, the antennae were advanced along the line of transection. The parenchyma was divided with electrocautery. Intra- and postoperative data were analyzed. Thirty-five patients (24 men) underwent liver resections. Diseases treated were colorectal metastases (n = 9), hepatic adenoma (n = 3), gallbladder cancer (n = 3), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 4), neuroendocrine tumor (n = 2), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 5), hemangioma (n = 2), focal nodular hyperplasia (n = 2), metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 1), hydatid cyst (n = 1), hepatoid carcinoma (n = 1), hepatolithiasis (n = 1), and suspected metastatic breast cancer (n = 1). Resections done were right hepatectomy (n = 19), segmental resection (n = 5), left hepatectomy (n = 4), extended right hepatectomy (n = 4), Segment IVb and Segment V resections during radical cholecystectomy (n = 2), and left lateral sectionectomy (n = 1). Median operative time for major resection was 188 and 251 minutes for minor resection. There was one postoperative mortality. Bile leak needing stenting occurred in one patient. Median blood loss for major resection was 500 mL and 265 mL for minor resection. Intraoperative transfusion was required in nine major and one minor resections. Other complications were ileus in four, deep vein thrombosis in two, intra-abdominal abscess in one, and cardiac events in two patients.

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of IORT as a tumour bed boost after whole breast irradiation (WBI) in breast conserving therapy. Methods: This was a single-arm prospective trial for women with breast cancer measuring <3cm. After breast-conserving surgery, a single IORT dose of 5Gray (Gy) prescribed to 10mm from the applicator surface was delivered to the breast tissues using 50kV X-ray followed by standard WBI. The feasibility rate of protocol therapy was defined as the percentage of all women who completed both IORT and WBI. A desirable completion rate was >90%. The protocol therapy would be considered unsuitable for further development if the completion rate was <75% or severe acute toxicity occurred in >15% of women who received IORT. Results: Sixty patients were recruited for the study. IORT and WBI were delivered in 58 and 55 patients, respectively. Thus, the feasibility rates of IORT alone and both IORT and WBI were 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 89-99%) and 92% (95% CI, 83-97%), respectively. A severe surgical complication or grade 3 or 4 acute radiation toxicity were identified in 10% (6/58) of women who had IORT. Conclusion: Tumour bed boost using IORT in women with early breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and WBI was shown to be feasibly consistent with previous studies. © 2010 The Authors.

A IORT boost allows higher radiation doses to tumor bed, avoiding the skin with low incidence of local recurrences and good esthetical results compared to external beam boost. The aim of this study is to present the twelve years results on local control, esthetic evaluation and toxicity of a randomized study on early stage breast cancer patients treated with 10 Gy IORT versus the same external beam dose. Materials and Methods: A randomized study on IORT versus external beam boost in early breast cancer patients was carried on in our Institution. Endpoints of the study were the evaluation of local recurrence (LR), toxicity and cosmetic result. From April 1999 to April 2004 244 patients were enrolled: 126 in IORT arm (131 treatments for 5 bilateral) and 118 inno IORT arm. The average age was 49.2 and 50 7 respectively. (Table presented). Toxicity valuation was assessed using EORTC/RTOG scale. The cosmetic result was detected on five parameters: hyperpigmentation, telangiectasias, hypertrophic scar, profile asymmetry and difference in consistency Results: The median follow-up was 124,7 months (range 96-148 months). Sixty women (24,6%) were younger than 45 years, 33 in IORT and 27 in no IORT arm. Two and four local recurrences were observed in IORT and no IORT arm respectively: both of the IORT arm recurrences were observed at more than 100 months follow up, while the mean time to recurrence in no IORT group was earlier (45 months). No local failures were observed in the group of IORT young women. As acute toxicity 12 patients developed post-surgical seromas and 7 wound healing problems occurred (7,8%). No late complications associated with IORT were observed, but three cases of liponecrosis in the treatment area. In 5 patients, a secondary mastectomy was performed for tumour multicentricity or excessive intraductal component. Cosmetic result was very good (objective valuation 92,8% good or excellent, subjective valuation 86,4%) and comparable to patients treated with external boost (87,4% good or excellent). The DFS was 92,1% and 88,7% in IORT and no IORT arm, 20 patients developed distant metastasis and 18 died (thirteen of them for disease). Ten patients were lost at the follow up. Conclusions: Our data suggest that IORT as anticipated boost after breast-conserving surgery is a reliable alternative to conventional postoperative external beam fractionated boost, particularly in younger women, for whom published studies indicate higher risk of local recurrence. The incidence of recurrence with the IORT boost, for any age, including young women, is quite low. Further research is required to clarify several issues such as identification of the most appropriate subgroups of patients for IORT as boost or complete replacement of postoperative radiotherapy.",,0

Materials and Methods: A nationwide online survey was conducted between October and December 2011 by AIRO Giovani group (members under 40 yrs-old of the Associazione Italiana Radioterapia Oncologica - Italian Society of Radiation Oncology). The survey included a total of 80 questions regarding general, demographic data and specific educational/training issues, focused on duration, organization, content and quality of residency programs. Main investigated aspects were: acquired skills in clinical oncology (CO), RO technical expertise, communication with patients and with other Oncology specialists, managing and research attitudes. All questionnaires were based on physicians' self-perception of personal training experience. Results: A total of 223 questionnaires (out of 450, 49.5%) were started, with 194 completed and considered for the present analysis (87%). The mean age was 32 yrs (range 27-40). Most of the RO fulfilling the questionnaire were female (70.5%), AIRO members (98%), young specialists (64.4%) and received their training at University Hospitals (73%), with a previous clinical experience in other clinical specialties (70.5%). In general, a substantial amount (85%) of respondents is satisfied with the decision of training in RO and is strongly motivated by the interest in oncology. Quality of training is globally considered good in the investigated areas (CO, relationship with patients, collaboration, managing, science; 67%). Education in RT-specific aspects such as 3D-CRT planning and in special procedures such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and stereotactic radiotherapy is judged good (70%). Training in other complex scenarios (radio-chemotherapy, intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT) and brachytherapy) still deserves optimization (27%), as for training in radiobiology and radioprotection, which is considered sufficient only by few respondents. Quality is perceived good for certain disease sites (breast, lung, prostate and gastrointestinal cancers; 75%), sufficient for others (brain, head and neck; 50%) and insufficient for pediatric and hematologic malignancies (50-60%). Training organization in terms of time schedules, rotational/educational plans, regular teaching sessions, scientific activities is generally judged good (81%). Conclusions: RO training quality in Italy is generally perceived as satisfactory for clinical aspects; education in some radiotherapy specific areas (high-tech, rare tumor sites) is perceived as lacking and could be implemented in the future. The STYRO Project, designed to obtain information regarding quality of training and needs in RO at a young level, could be compared with similar European experiences and could be useful for new educational programs implementation.",,0

However, long-term outcomes on toxicity (e.g. telangiectasia) and cosmesis remain a major concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the dosimetric feasibility of using targeted non-toxic radiosensitizing gold nanoparticles (GNPs) for localized dose enhancement to the planning target volume (PTV) during electronic brachytherapy APBI while reducing normal tissue toxicity. We propose to incorporate GNPs into a micrometer-thick polymer film on the surface of routinely used lumpectomy balloon applicators and provide subsequent treatment using a 50 kVp Xoft device. An experimentally determined diffusion coefficient was used to determine space-time customizable distribution of GNPs for feasible in-vivo concentrations of 7 mg/g and 43 mg/g. An analytical approach from previously published work was employed to estimate the dose enhancement due to GNPs as a function of distance up to 1 cm from the lumpectomy cavity surface. Clinically significant dose enhancement values of at least 1.2, due to 2 nm GNPs, were found at 1 cm away from the lumpectomy cavity wall when using electronic brachytherapy APBI. Higher customizable dose enhancement was also achieved at other distances as a function of nanoparticle size. Our preliminary results suggest that significant dose enhancement can be achieved to residual tumor cells targeted with GNPs during APBI with electronic brachytherapy. Copyright © 2015.",,0

RESULTS: Accuracy in identifying dominant perforators was 91.3 % for both techniques and mean error in calibre measurement 1.18 +/- 0.35 mm for CTA and 1.63 +/- 0.39 mm for MRA. Accuracy in assessing perforator IMCs was 97.1 % for CTA and 88.4 % for MRA, DVC 94.4 % for both techniques, SVC 91.3 % as well, and DIEA branching type 100 % for CTA and 91.3 % for MRA. Image acquisition and interpretation time was 21 +/- 3 min for CTA (35 +/- 5 min for MRA). CONCLUSIONS: In a strategy to optimise DIEP flap planning avoiding radiation exposure, MRA can be proposed alternatively to CTA. KEY POINTS: * Identification of deep inferior epigastric perforators (DIEP) is important before breast reconstruction. * Both CT and MR angiography are accurate in identifying DIEA perforator branches. * CTA and MRA are equivalent in demonstrating perforator-venous connections. * MRA can be proposed as an alternative to CTA in DIEP planning.",eng,0

A multidisciplinary working group of the Italian Association for Medical Physics applied FMEA to electron beam intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) delivered using mobile linear accelerators, aiming at preventing accidental exposures to the patient. Methods and Materials: FMEA was applied to the IORT process, for the stages of the treatment delivery and verification, and consisted of three steps: 1) identification of the involved subprocesses; 2) identification and ranking of the potential failure modes, together with their causes and effects, using the risk probability number (RPN) scoring system, based on the product of three parameters (severity, frequency of occurrence and detectability, each ranging from 1 to 10); 3) identification of additional safety measures to be proposed for process quality and safety improvement. RPN upper threshold for little concern of risk was set at 125. Results: Twenty-four subprocesses were identified. Ten potential failure modes were found and scored, in terms of RPN, in the range of 42-216. The most critical failure modes consisted of internal shield misalignment, wrong Monitor Unit calculation and incorrect data entry at treatment console. Potential causes of failure included shield displacement, human errors, such as underestimation of CTV extension, mainly because of lack of adequate training and time pressures, failure in the communication between operators, and machine malfunctioning. The main effects of failure were represented by CTV underdose, wrong dose distribution and/or delivery, unintended normal tissue irradiation. As additional safety measures, the utilization of a dedicated staff for IORT, double-checking of MU calculation and data entry and finally implementation of in vivo dosimetry were suggested. Conclusions: FMEA appeared as a useful tool for prospective evaluation of patient safety in radiotherapy. The application of this method to IORT lead to identify three safety measures for risk mitigation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,0

Patients and methods: Between December 2000 and June 2001, 54 patients affected by early-stage breast cancer underwent exclusive IOERT to the tumour bed using a Novac7 mobile linac, after quadrantectomy. Electron beams (5, 7, 9MeV) at high dose per pulse values (0.02-0.09Gy/pulse) were used. The prescribed single dose was 21Gy at the depth of 90% isodose (14-22 mm). In 35 cases, in vivo dosimetry was performed. The entrance dose was derived from the surface dose measured with thin and calibrated MD-55-2 radiochromic films, wrapped in sterile envelopes. Films were analysed 24-72 h after the irradiation using a charge-coupled-device imaging system. Field disturbance caused by the film envelope was negligible. Results: The mean deviation between measured and expected doses was 1.8%, with one SD equal to 4.7%. Deviations larger than 7% were found in 23% of cases, never consecutively, not correlated with beam energy or field size and with no evidence of linac daily output variation or serious malfunctioning or human mistake. The estimated overall uncertainty of dose measurement was about 4%. In vivo dosimetry appeared both reliable and feasible. Two action levels, for unexplained observed deviations larger than 7 and 10%, were preliminary defined. Conclusions: Satisfactory agreement between measured and expected doses was found. The implementation of in vivo dosimetry in IOERT is suggested, particularly for patients enrolled in a clinical trial. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",,0

The Liac delivers electron beams at 4, 6, 8 and 10 MeV. A radiation survey to determine photon leakage and scatter consisted of air kerma measurements on a spherical surface of 1.5 m radius, centered on the titanium exit window of the accelerating structure. Measurements were taken using a 30 cm3 calibrated cylindrical ion chamber in three orthogonal planes, at the maximum electron energy. For each point, 10 Gy was delivered. At selected points, the quality of x-ray radiation was determined by using lead sheets, and measurements were performed for all energies to investigate the energy dependence of stray radiation. The photon scatter contribution from the metallic internal patient-shielding in IORT, used to protect normal tissues underlying the target, was also evaluated. At seven locations outside the OR, the air kerma values derived from in-room measurements were compared to measurements directly performed using a survey meter. The results, for a delivered dose of 10 Gy, showed that the air kerma values ranged from approximately 6 microGy (upper and rear sides of the Liac) to 320 microGy (lateral to beam stopper) in the two orthogonal vertical planes, while values lower than 18 microGy were found in the horizontal plane. At 10 MeV, transmission behind 1 cm lead shield was found to be 42%. The use of internal shielding appeared to increase the photon scatter only slightly. Air kerma values outside the OR were generally lower than 1 mGy for an annual workload of 200 patients. Thus, the Liac can safely work in a conventional OR, while the need for additional shielding mainly depends on patient workload. Our data can be useful for centers planning to implement an IORT program using a mobile linear accelerator, permitting radiation safety personnel to estimate in advance the shielding required for a particular workload.",,0

In the present study, a further step was made, aiming at the improvement of the effectiveness of in vivo dosimetry, based on a real-time check of the dose. Materials and methods: Entrance dose was determined using micro-MOSFET detectors placed inside a thin, sterile, transparent catheter. The epoxy side of the detector was faced towards the beam to minimize the anisotropy. Each detector was plugged into a bias supply (standard sensitivity) and calibrated at 5 Gy using 6 MeV electrons produced by a conventional linac. Detectors were characterized in terms of linearity, precision and dose per pulse dependence. No energy and temperature dependence was found. The sensitivity change of detectors was about 1% per 20 Gy accumulated dose. Correction factors to convert surface to entrance dose were determined for each combination of energy and applicator. From November 2004 to May 2005, in vivo dosimetry was performed on 45 patients affected by early-stage breast cancer, who underwent IOERT to the tumour bed. IOERT was delivered using electrons (4-10 MeV) at high dose per pulse, produced by either a Novac7 or a Liac mobile linac. Results: The mean ratio between measured and expected dose was 1.006+/-0.035 (1 SD), in the range 0.92-1.1. The procedure uncertainty was 3.6%. Micro-MOSFETs appeared suitable for in vivo dosimetry in IOERT, although some unfavourable aspects, like the limited lifetime and the anisotropy with no build-up, were found. Prospectively, a real-time action level (+/-6%) on dose discrepancy was defined. Conclusions: Excellent agreement between measured and expected doses was found. Real-time in vivo dosimetry appeared feasible, reliable and more effective than the method previously published. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",,0

To avoid the deleterious effects of PMRT, surgeons will often delay reconstruction until after PMRT is complete. Drawbacks to this approach include additional surgery, recuperation, cost, and an extended reconstructive process. Even if a tissue expander is used to preserve the skin envelope during irradiation, the post-PMRT breast pocket is often distorted or constricted necessitating some skin replacement, resulting in a compromised aesthetic outcome. Therefore, a systematic approach to mitigate the deleterious effects of PMRT was developed, and primary DIEP flap reconstruction was offered to patients requiring PMRT. This study evaluates the outcome of this approach in a cohort of patients undergoing immediate bilateral DIEP flap reconstruction with unilateral PMRT, allowing comparison between irradiated and nonirradiated flaps. METHODS: One hundred twenty-five patients who underwent immediate DIEP reconstruction between 2009 and 2011 were identified. Eleven consecutive patients had bilateral DIEP reconstructions by a single surgeon and received unilateral PMRT. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative steps were taken in all patients to ensure flap vascularity, prevent uncontrolled contracture, and limit radiation damage to the breast mound. Results were documented photographically and the irradiated and nonirradiated breasts were compared. The complication rates, incidence of clinically significant fat necrosis, and need for reoperation were examined. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 18 months (range, 8-21 months). Complications were minor and did not require readmission to the hospital or reoperation. There was no incidence of clinically significant fat necrosis in either the irradiated or nonirradiated DIEP flaps. Four operative revisions for breast symmetry were required in 3 of 11 patients. Aesthetic outcomes were deemed satisfactory in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Primary reconstruction with DIEP flaps can be performed successfully in patients who require PMRT if steps are taken to ensure flap vascularity, minimize fibrosis, optimize contour, and modulate radiation dosing.",eng,0

Kronowitz,2012.0,Acellular dermal matrix in irradiated tissue expander/implant-based breast reconstruction: evidence-based review,10.1097/PRS.0b013e318265f690,"BACKGROUND: The benefits of acellular dermal matrix for breast reconstruction have been well described. However, its clinical impact for breast reconstruction in the setting of radiation therapy has not been well reported. METHODS: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were reviewed for articles published between January of 2005 and February of 2012 on breast reconstruction using acellular dermal matrix in the setting of radiation therapy. The authors also reviewed their institutional experience of consecutive patients who met these criteria between January of 2008 and October of 2011. RESULTS: Thirteen articles were identified for review: three animal studies on acellular dermal matrix and 10 with level III evidence of its use in humans. The 10 clinical studies included 246 irradiated patients. The M. D. Anderson experience included 30 irradiated acellular dermal matrix patients for a total of 276 irradiated patients evaluated in this review. Use of acellular dermal matrix in implant-based breast reconstruction in the setting of radiation therapy did not predispose to higher infection or overall complication rates or prevent bioprosthetic mesh incorporation. However, the rate of mesh incorporation may be slowed. Its use allowed for increased intraoperative saline fill volumes, which improved aesthetic outcomes and allowed patients to awake from surgery with a formed breast. CONCLUSIONS: Use of acellular dermal matrix for implant-based breast reconstruction does not appear to increase or decrease the risk of complications, but it might provide psychological and aesthetic benefits. Multicenter or single-center randomized controlled trials that provide high-quality, level I evidence are warranted.",eng,0

Target volume (PTV) homogeneity and dose coverage are important parameters to evaluate a brachytherapy implant. Homogeneity is normally determined using the dose homogeneity index (DHI). In this work we discuss about whether DHI is or not the best index to evaluate homogeneity on intracavitary implants, like balloon brachytherapy techniques. DHI is defined in the scope of interstitial techniques. In addition, there is a dependence between DHI and irradiated volumes that can imply non-conclusive results. Dose volume histograms (DVH) are the best tools to evaluate those parameters. Materials: The applicator is placed in the lumpectomy cavity and the balloon is inflated, shaping the PTV as a 1 cm thick shell spherically distributed surrounding the balloon. The treatment is delivered with a prescription dose of 340 cGy f fraction in ten fractions. A multiple dwell position technique has been used to compensate the anisotropy of the source, and improve the dose coverage in PTV. Dosimetric results for treated patients have been collected in DVH. DHI, defined as DHI = V100 - V150 f V100 by Wu et ai, have been calculated for these patients. Results: DVH for fourteen patients treated with MammoSite applicator and two interstitial cases are shown in the figure (solid and dashed lines, respectively). Dose coverage has been improved compared to interstitial techniques. Calculated DHI has a mean value of 0.66 (s = 0.03 %) for MammoSite implants, comparable to those of other authors, and 0.91 (s = 0.01 %) for interstitial techiques. According to these results, MammoSite implants are less uniform than interstitial case. Nevertheless smaller values of V100 imply greater values of DHI, specially if the difference between V100 and V150 is great. In case of brachytherapy with MammoSite applicator, that situation is not necessary correlated with a correct level of homogeneity, as the fictitious case in figure (DHI = 0.94, pointed line). (Graph presented) Conclusions: Homogeneity and dose coverage have been evaluated based on DVH. DHI does not contain all implant characteristics. Results referred to these parameters should be extracted from the information contained in DVH.",,0

The sentinel node biopsy (SN) technique has received much attention as a possible alternative to axillary lymph node dissection. The aim of this study is to identify the sentinel node by periareolar and subdermal injection of the radiopharmaceutical in four points, independent of tumor topography and the presence of biopsies and/or previous surgery. The peritumoral injection technique was carried out for comparison purposes. This study was performed on 115 patients, divided into 2 groups: Group A (25 patients, peritumoral injection) and Group B (90 patients, injection in four points). All the SN biopsies were studied by both imprint cytology and H&E staining. Control axillary lymph-node dissection was followed in all patients from Group A and in these positive cases from Group B. Twenty-two out of the twenty-five (88%) SNs were identified in Group A. There was no false negative; the sensitivity and specificity were 100%. Eighty-two of the ninety (91.1%) SNs were identified in Group B. Lymphoscintigraphy showed radiopharmaceutical migration to axilla in 93.7% of the cases. Hotspot area was 10 to 100 times the intensity of the background radiation. Among the 92 cases with negative sentinel nodes at intraoperative examination (TP), the SN histopathology confirmed the absence of cancer cells in 89 patients, whereas 3 were positive for metastatic cells. This study shows that periareolar injection in four points seems to be a good lymphatic mapping method for SN identification. We suggest standardizing this site of injection to identify the SNs.

Burnet,2005.0,Reduction of radiotherapy-induced late complications in early breast cancer: the role of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and partial breast irradiation. Part II--Radiotherapy strategies to reduce radiation-induced late effects,", ","Radiotherapy after conservation surgery has been proven to decrease local relapse and death from breast cancer, and is now firmly established in the management of early breast carcinoma. Currently, the challenge is to optimise the therapeutic ratio by minimising treatment-related morbidity, while maintaining or improving local control and survival. The second part of this review examines the role of two approaches: intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and partial breast irradiation, as means of improving the therapeutic ratio. Discussion of IMRT includes both inverse- and forward-planned methods: the breast usually requires minimal modulation to improve dose homogeneity, and therefore lends itself to simpler forward-planned IMRT techniques; whereas inverse-planned IMRT may be useful in selected cases. There are many dosimetry studies reporting the superiority of IMRT over conventional breast radiotherapy, but there is still a paucity of clinical data regarding patient benefit from these techniques. A critical literature review of clinical partial breast radiotherapy studies focuses on the influence of irradiated breast volume, dose and fractionation, and patient selection on normal tissue side-effects and local control. Clinical reports of partial breast irradiation show several encouraging, but some concerning results about local recurrence rates. Therefore, mature results from randomised trials comparing partial breast irradiation with whole-breast radiotherapy are required. Accurate localisation of the tumour bed and application of appropriate clinical target volumes and planning target volumes are discussed in detail, as these concepts are fundamental for partial breast irradiation.",eng,0

Based on the hypothesis a modified radiotracer injection technique was established and could increase the visualization rate of the IM-SLN significantly. To verify the hypothesis, two kinds of tracers were injected at different sites of breast. The radiotracer was injected with the modified technique, and the fluorescence tracer was injected in the peritumoral intra-parenchyma. The location of IM-SLN was identified by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma probe. Then, internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) was performed. The fluorescence status of IM-SLN was identified by the fluorescence imaging system. A total of 216 patients were enrolled from September 2013 to July 2015. The overall visualization rate of IM-SLN was 71.8% (155/216). The success rate of IM-SLNB was 97.3% (145/149).

Systematic and random setup uncertainties of 3.0 mm and 2.6 mm, respectively, were found for VM-DIBH treatment from the chest wall measurements. Intrabeam breath-hold stability was found to be good, with over 96% of delivered fields within 3 mm. Average treatment MHD was significantly larger for those patients where some of the heart was planned in the field compared to patients whose heart was completely shielded in the plan (p &lt; 0.001). No evidence for a minimum BHL was found, suggesting that all patients who can tolerate DIBH may yield a benefit from it.",eng,0

Methods and Materials: The MOSFET system response in terms of reproducibility, energy, dose rate and temperature dependence, dose-linearity from 1 to 25 Gy, angular response, and dose perturbation was analyzed in the 6-9-MeV electron beam energy range produced by an intraoperative radiotherapy-dedicated mobile accelerator. We compared these with the 6- and 9-MeV electron beams produced by a conventional accelerator. MOSFETs were also used in clinical dosimetry. Results: In experimental conditions, the overall uncertainty of the MOSFET response was within 3.5% (+/-SD). The investigated electron energies and the dose rate did not significantly influence the MOSFET calibration factors. The dose perturbation was negligible. In vivo dosimetry results were in accordance with the predicted values within +/-5%. A discordance occurred either for an incorrect position of the dosimeter on the patient or when a great difference existed between the clinical and calibration setup, particularly when performing exit dose measurements. Conclusion: Metal oxide silicon field effect transistors are suitable for in vivo dosimetry during intraoperative radiotherapy because their overall uncertainty is comparable to the accuracy required in target dose delivery. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.",,0

SETTING: (1) TARGIT-A randomised clinical trial (ISRCTN34086741) which compared TARGIT with traditional EBRT and found similar breast cancer control, particularly when TARGIT was given simultaneously with lumpectomy, (2) 2 additional UK centres offering TARGIT. PARTICIPANTS: 485 UK patients (249 TARGIT, 236 EBRT) in the prepathology stratum of TARGIT-A trial (where randomisation occurred before lumpectomy and TARGIT was delivered simultaneously with lumpectomy) for whom geographical data were available and 22 patients treated with TARGIT after completion of the TARGIT-A trial in 2 additional UK breast centres. OUTCOME MEASURES: The shortest total journey distance, time and CO2 emissions from home to hospital to receive all the fractions of radiotherapy. METHODS: Distances, time and CO2 emissions were calculated using Google Maps and assuming a fuel efficiency of 40 mpg. The groups were compared using the Student t test with unequal variance and the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test. RESULTS: TARGIT patients travelled significantly fewer miles: TARGIT 21 681, mean 87.1 (SE 19.1) versus EBRT 92 591, mean 392.3 (SE 30.2); had lower CO2 emissions 24.7 kg (SE 5.4) vs 111 kg (SE 8.6) and spent less time travelling: 3 h (SE 0.53) vs 14 h (SE 0.76), all p<0.0001.

We aimed to understand preferences for this evolving radiotherapy treatment for early breast cancer (EBC) in health professionals, and how they changed over time and in response to emerging data. Preferences for single dose IORT or EBRT for EBC were elicited in 2004 and 2011, together with factors that may be associated with these preferences. Methods: Western Australian health professionals working with breast cancer patients were invited to complete a validated, self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire used hypothetical scenarios and trade-off methodology to determine the maximum increase in risk of local recurrence health professionals were willing to accept in order to have a single dose of IORT in the place of EBRT if they were faced with this decision themselves. Results: Health professional characteristics were similar across the two time points although 2011 included a higher number of nurse (49% vs. 36%) and allied health (10% vs. 4%) participants and a lower number of radiation therapists (17% vs. 32%) compared to 2004.Health professional preferences varied, with 7.5% and 3% judging IORT unacceptable at any risk, 18% and 21% judging IORT acceptable only if offering an equivalent risk, 56% and 59% judging IORT acceptable with a low maximum increase in risk (1-3%) and 19% and 17% judging a high maximum increase in risk acceptable (4-5%), in 2004 and 2011 respectively. A significantly greater number of nurses accepted IORT as a treatment option in 2011.Conclusions: Most Western Australian health professionals working with breast cancer patients are willing to accept an increase in risk of local recurrence in order to replace EBRT with IORT in a hypothetical setting. This finding was consistent over two time points spanning 7 years despite the duration of clinical experience with IORT and the publication of the early clinical results of IORT in 2010. These results need to be compared with preferences elicited from patient groups, and further investigation into the impact of personal preferences on health professionals' advice to patients is warranted. © 2014 Corica et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,0

The primary endpoint is LR rates; the a priori hypothesis is that IORT will give a non-inferior risk of LR compared with EBRT. Early results suggest non-inferiority however mature results are not yet available. It is unclear what LR risk patients and clinicians consider 'non-inferior'. In order to guide women and their doctors making choices about radiotherapy for EBC, a Patient Preference study was performed to determine what increased risk of LR, without detriment to survival, women who have completed radiotherapy for EBC would accept, in return for the increased convenience and possibly decreased toxicity of IORT. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of patient preferences and their determinants in 209 women who had radiotherapy on the TARGIT trial in Western Australia. Preferences were obtained from 108 participants who received IORT and 101 who received EBRT. Preferences were determined by a self-rated questionnaire using validated trade-off methodology. Disease, treatment, and demographic details were collected, and quality of life during radiotherapy was self-rated by patients. Results: While 36% of patients were prepared to accept a 4%-6% increase in risk of LR for the increased convenience of IORT, 22% would not accept IORT at all. Multivariate Poisson regression identified treatment received as the only significant determinant of patient preferences (p < 0.0001). This is despite significant differences found in two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of quality of life scores during treatment all favouring IORT. Comparison of the treatment groups found that 60% of IORT patients would accept IORT at an increased risk of 4%-6% in contrast to 12% of patients in the EBRT group. Only 2% of IORT patients indicated they would not have IORT at all, in contrast to 43% of EBRT patients. Conclusion: Willingness of patients to accept IORT was discordant between the two treatment groups. The EBRT group were risk-averse, whilst patients who had IORT valued the convenience of IORT highly. Participants of this study have justified the treatment they were randomly allocated to, which questions the validity of post-treatment patient preference studies. Further research targeting patients who have not yet received radiotherapy will now follow, in order to better inform future patients and their clinicians. Given the early results of the TARGIT trial however, it is unlikely that the clinical difference in LR between IORT and EBRT will exceed what patients will accept.",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Longitudinal cosmesis and QOL data were collected from a subset of TARGIT-A participants who received TARGIT-IORT as a separate procedure (postpathology). Patients completed a cosmetic assessment before radiation therapy and annually thereafter for at least 5 years. Patients also completed the combined European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire and Breast-Specific Module in addition to the Body Image after Breast Cancer Questionnaire at baseline and annually thereafter. The combined EORTC questionnaires were also collected 3, 6, and 9 months after wide local excision. RESULTS: An Excellent-Good cosmetic result was scored more often than a Fair-Poor result for both treatment groups across all time points. The TARGIT-IORT patients reported better breast-related QOL than EBRT patients. Statistically and clinically significant differences were seen at month 6 and year 1, with EBRT patients having moderately worse breast symptoms (a statistically significant difference of more than 10 in a 100-point scale) than TARGIT-IORT patients at these time points. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with TARGIT-IORT on the TARGIT-A trial have similar self-reported cosmetic outcome but better breast-related QOL outcomes than patients treated with EBRT. This important evidence can facilitate the treatment decision-making process for patients who have early breast cancer suitable for breast-conserving surgery and inform their clinicians.",eng,1

Crowe,2014.0,Conservative axillary surgery in breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy: long-term results,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2013.12.041,"BACKGROUND: Recently, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial demonstrated that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) could be safely avoided in selected breast cancer patients with limited nodal disease and having breast conservation therapy. However, for node positive (N+) mastectomy patients, full ALND remains the standard of care. Hypothesizing that omission of complete ALND is safe in many N+ breast cancer patients, a hybrid procedure called conservative axillary regional excision (CARE) was developed, consisting of removal of sentinel nodes and other palpable nodes (without intraoperative frozen section or reoperation for N+). STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of patients undergoing mastectomy with CARE between 2002 and 2010 was performed. Data collected included demographics; staging; number of lymph nodes removed; adjuvant, antihormonal, and radiation therapies; recurrence; lymphedema; and survival data. Recurrence-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using Cox proportional hazards. RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty-seven patients underwent mastectomy with CARE. Mean follow-up was 5.1 years. A median of 8 nodes were removed. There were 7 patients with local recurrence, of which 3 were axillary recurrences. Lymphedema developed in 20 (3.4%) patients, 75% of which had neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Lymphedema development was associated with the number of lymph nodes removed (p = 0.05) and radiation therapy (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Conservative axillary regional excision is an excellent model for understanding the role of limited axillary surgery in mastectomy patients. The locoregional recurrence rate among N1 patients having CARE is low (3.4%). Conservative axillary regional excision is also associated with low rates of lymphedema. These data support the use of limited ALND in selected N+ mastectomy patients.",eng,0

Nicosia,1997.0,Cytologic evaluation of lumpectomy margins in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ: clinical outcome,", ","BACKGROUND: Breast conservation therapy is controversial for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) due to recently reported high recurrence rates. We believe that cytologic evaluation of lumpectomy margins improves efficiency and leads to a lower recurrence rate following lumpectomy for DCIS. METHODS: A prospectively accrued database of 1255 breast cancer patients at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute was found to have 218 patients with DCIS (17.4%). Of those 218 cases, 114 were treated with lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and radiation therapy; the remaining 104 patients were treated with mastectomy with or without reconstruction. Imprint cytology was used to evaluate all lumpectomy margins. Permanent sections and imprint cytology were reviewed by the same pathologist. RESULTS: All lumpectomy specimens (116 tumors in 114 patients) were evaluated. The median follow up was 57.5 months (range 2-110 months). One hundred and three patients with 104 tumors were selected on the basis of pure DCIS (with or without microinvasion), and treated with lumpectomy, axillary dissection and radiation therapy. Of the 104 tumors utilizing attempted breast conservation therapy, 7 (6.6%) required mastectomy. There were 6 recurrences (6.1%) with a median time for recurrence of 47.5 months (range 27-85 months); four recurrences were comedo and two were noncomedo at original diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The determination of lumpectomy margins in DCIS patients using imprint cytology leads to an overall recurrence rate of 6.1% with reduction in operative time, and re-excision rate. Significant recurrence rates were associated with microinvasion and multifocal tumors (28%) versus simple DCIS at 5 years. Breast conservation therapy and surgical margin determination with imprint cytology for DCIS is a cost-effective and reliable method of treatment for simple DCIS.",eng,0
Journal Article,C. E. Cox; S. Pendas; N. N. Ku; D. S. Reintgen; H. S. Greenberg; S. V. Nicosia,1998.0,Local recurrence of breast cancer after cytological evaluation of lumpectomy margins,", ","Successful breast conservation therapy with optimal cosmesis requires adequate tumor excision and negative tumor margins. Therefore, more sensitive techniques are being developed to identify lumpectomy margins intraoperatively with greater accuracy. Unidentified microscopic disease is seemingly responsible for a local recurrence rate of up to 25 per cent 3 to 5 years after lumpectomy and radiotherapy for breast cancer patients. As a result, Moffitt Cancer Center has routinely used an intraoperative touch preparation cytology (TPC) protocol to evaluate the entire resected surface of all lumpectomies. In addition, resection margins were also evaluated by gross examination and by standard histology. In rare instances frozen sections were used to evaluate tumor margins. In this study 701 consecutive lumpectomy specimens were evaluated by TPC during the period of 9 years with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years. Local cancer recurrence was 2.7 per cent (mean recurrence, 2.53 years), in women whose lumpectomy margins were evaluated by TPC. Of interest, a local recurrence rate of 14.6 per cent was observed in patients who had referral lumpectomies evaluated by conventional histopathology. This study suggests that accurate margin assessment with TPC plays an important role in the control of local recurrence after breast conservation therapy. Therefore, we conclude the routine use of intraoperative TPC provides rapid, reliable, topographically accurate identification of residual microscopic disease at lumpectomy margins.",eng,0

In selected patients with early stage breast cancer, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has emerged as an alternative treatment option to WBI. Early trials of APBI have demonstrated an excellent local control rate and an associated good-to-excellent cosmetic outcome. APBI can reduce both the treatment volume and overall treatment time of adjuvant radiation therapy, which potentially overcomes logistical barriers associated with WBI that have previously prevented eligible women from pursuing breast-conserving therapy. Likewise, the addition of new modalities for APBI delivery has increased the number of patients who might be eligible for this adjuvant treatment - in the setting of breast-conserving surgery - despite the limited availability of long-term data on APBI outcomes compared to historical WBI outcomes. Ongoing phase III trials aim to compare APBI with WBI and also point the practitioner to the appropriate APBI patient selection criteria. Here, we review available modalities, patient selection criteria and consensus guideline recommendations, and current controversies in APBI. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Conservative breast surgery (CBS) is one of the preferred surgical options, because both the oncologic and esthetic needs of the patient can be addressed. CBS surgical outcomes tend to be more effective with reduced chances of disease recurrence when radiotherapy (RT) treatment is considered as an adjunct treatment, either applied during surgery (IORT) and/or after (EBRT). The purpose of our study was to compare surgical outcomes between IORT and EBRT after CBS. In the past 5 years, we performed CBS in 489 patients in our clinic. Of these patients, 83 underwent adjunct treatment with IORT and 109 were treated with EBRT in accordance with our university approved clinical protocol. Surgical outcomes, early complication rates, and esthetic results were compared between these two groups of CBS patients, with a mean follow-up time of 17 months. IORT allowed breast irradiation treatment to be performed without effecting overlying skin, thus cosmetic outcomes tended to be favorable. Esthetic postoperative results assessed with the Breast Cancer Conservation Treatment (BCCTcore) software showed that the differences between IORT and EBRT were not statistically significant (including those patients that underwent further oncoplastic techniques after EBRT). The disease recurrence rates between the two groups were not significantly different. IORT is a safe, fast, and feasible technique that provides effective and comparable CBS outcomes for patients with breast cancer. Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,1

The machine provides a 50 kVp X-ray beam, currently used to treat the cancers of skin, eyelid or rectum. The system can be mounted with various applicators of different diameters or shapes. These applicators can be fixed over the main rod tube of the unit in order to deliver the prescribed dose into the tumour with an optimal dose distribution. Materials and Methods: We have analyzed depth dose curves and dose profiles for the naked tube and for a set of three applicators with SSD of 28.7mm, 32.3mm and 38.3mm. Dose measurements were made with an ionization chamber (PTW type 23342) and Gafchromic films (EBT2). We have also compared the measurements with Monte Carlo simulations (code PENELOPE) which have been used with a detailed geometrical description of the experimental setup. Results: The depths of the 50% isodose in water for the various applicators are respectively 6.0, 6.6 and 7.1 mm. Results showed a good agreement between simulations and physical measurements. Simulations are able to provide an accurate evaluation of the dose delivered. The following figure illustrates the close correlation between the measurements performed with a PTW ion chamber and the data from Monte Carlo PENELOPE simulations for depth dose curve using a 3 cm straight end applicator. (Figure presented) Moreover, we design a specific software named 'MC2Plan' that uses a pre-calculated dose distribution data from Monte Carlo simulations. MC2Plan can be useful to display isodoses when combining contact Xrays radiotherapy and external beam radiotherapy in order to help radiation oncologists to optimize treatments. Conclusions: The Monte Carlo PENELOPE simulations are in accordance with the measurements for a 50 kV X-ray system. Simulations are able to confirm the measurements provided by Gafchromic films or ionization chambers. Results also demonstrate that Monte Carlo simulations could be helpful to validate the future applicators designed for other applications such as intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) for breast cancer. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations could be a reliable alternative for a rapid evaluation of the dose delivered by such a system that uses multiple designs of applicators.",,0

Device interrogation was performed after the first and last radiation treatment, with comparative cardiac monitoring performed before and after the first three treatments. Results: Eight patients were treated and have a mean follow-up of 6 months. Three patients received HDRBB delivering 34 Gy in 10 fractions. Mean planning target volume for evaluation (PTV-EVAL) coverage was 93.6%. The maximum radiation dose delivered to any device was 1.03 Gy, with a mean pacemaker distance to lumpectomy cavity (DLC) of 9.1 cm. Five patients received 3D-CRT consisting of 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions. The mean 90% PTV-EVAL coverage was 97.3%. Maximum dose delivered to any device was 1.68 Gy at a DLC of 9 cm. Local toxicity did not exceed grade 1, and no adverse device events were noted. Conclusions: APBI in patients with pacemakers or AICDs who desire breast preservation seems to be a technically safe and reasonable application of targeted radiation therapy. © Society of Surgical Oncology 2011.",,0

Methods: An IRB approved review was performed of prospectively obtained data on early-stage breast cancer patients with an implanted pacemaker or AICD treated between April 2007 and July 2010. Patients were treated with either 3-D CRT or HDR based on the NSABP-B39 protocol. Treatment planning and simulation data, as well as treatment records were evaluated. Device interrogation was performed after the first and last radiation treatment with comparative cardiac monitoring performed prior to and following the first three treatments. Results: There were 8 patients treated by lumpectomy with a median of 7 months (range, 0 to 23 months) of follow- up. 3 patients received balloon brachytherapy with either a MammoSite single-lumen balloon catheter (n=1), or a Contura multi-lumen balloon catheter (n=2) delivering 34 Gy in 10 fractions. Mean lumpectomy cavity volume (LCV) was 53.4cc (range 49.3 to 59.8cc) with a planning target volume for evaluation (PTV-eval) coverage of 93.6% (range, 90.2 to 96.3%). The maximum dose of radiation delivered to the device was 103 cGy (range 39- 103 cGy) with a mean pacemaker distance to lumpectomy cavity (DLC) of 9.1cm (range 4.3- 23.2cm). 5 patients received 3-D CRT consisting of 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions. The mean LCV was 67.8cc (range 13.5-132.7cc). The mean PTV-eval coverage was 97.3% (range, 92.5- 99.8%). The maximum dose delivered to the device was 168 cGy (range, 23-168 cGy) at a DLC of 9cm (range, 1.8-24.3cm)(fig. 1). No delays in treatment or local toxicities greater than grade I were identified. No adverse events were noted during or after treatment related to the pacemaker or AICD. Conclusions: The ability to safely deliver appropriate PBI therapy in patients with pacemakers or AICDs who desire breast preservation is supported by these data.(Figure presented).",,0

Literature databases were searched up to March 2002 inclusive. IORT studies of any design and breast conserving therapy randomised controlled trials with sample sizes greater than 500 patients (with at least one arm of breast conserving therapy (BCT)) and systematic reviews on BCT published since 1992, were included for comparison. Seven unique IORT studies were located; one randomised controlled trial, one study with a concurrent control group and five case series. Minor postoperative complications were reported following IORT. Short-term results were similar for both treatment modalities in terms of local recurrence, disease-free and overall survival. However, the current evidence base is poor, making definitive assessment on IORT very difficult. Further research is required to clarify several issues such as identification of the most appropriate subgroups of patients for IORT, a comparison of the currently available mobile IORT technologies, establishing whether IORT is most appropriate as a boost replacement dose or replacement for all postoperative radiotherapy, the examination of how biological repair processes may differ between the two treatment modalities and determining precisely where local recurrences originate with respect to the original tumour site.",,0

To avoid these problems, we developed a novel radiolabeled blue dye that can be injected intraoperatively. METHODS: We performed a phase I/II trial (IND#70627) of sterile pyrogen-free I-methylene blue to identify sentinel nodes in patients with breast cancer. Twelve women were studied. Two women each were given peritumoral or circumareolar injections of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, or 1000 microCi of I methylene blue. RESULTS: Sentinel nodes were detected in 11 of 12 patients, with a low-dose 200 microCi patient being the single exception. The number of sentinel nodes detected per patient ranged from 0 to 3 (mean = 1.66 nodes/case). Radioactivity at the tumor injection site [counts per second (cps) averaged over 10 seconds] ranged from 3346 to 47,300 cps and was highly dose-dependent (r = 0.90, P = 0.0002). In contrast, the in vivo node counts ranged from 0 to 1228 cps, while ex vivo counts ranged from 0 to 1516 cps. The in vivo nodal counts were dose-dependent (r = 0.67, and P = 0.0231). Radiation was carefully monitored inside the operating room and in pathology. Even with the 1-mCi dose, the radioactive blue dye produced significantly lower personnel exposure than historically seen with Tc. CONCLUSIONS: This method eliminates the painful preoperative injections of Tc colloid, is performed by the surgeon in the operating room, is associated with lower radiation exposures for personnel, and avoids the delays caused by nonoperating room personnel. These observations warrant a more extensive trial of this method using the 1000-microCi dose of I methylene blue dye for sentinel lymph node biopsies.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Three hundred forty-two evaluable patients were enrolled by 23 institutions between January 2008 and February 2011. All patients received 34 Gy in 10 fractions, delivered twice daily. Rigorous target coverage and normal tissue dose constraints were observed. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 36 months (range, 1-54 months). For the entire patient cohort of 342 patients, 10 patients experienced an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Eight of these IBTR were classified as true recurrences/marginal miss (TRMM), and 2 were elsewhere failures (EF). Local recurrence-free survival was 97.8% at 3 years. For the entire cohort, 88% of patients had good to excellent overall cosmesis. The overall incidence of infection was 8.5%. Symptomatic seroma was reported in only 4.4% of patients. A separate analysis was performed to determine whether improved outcomes would be observed for patients treated at high-volume centers with extensive brachytherapy experience. Three IBTR were observed in this cohort, only 1 of which was classified as a TRMM. Local recurrence-free survival at high-volume centers was 98.1% at 3 years. Overall cosmetic outcome and toxicity were superior in patients treated at high-volume centers. In these patients, 95% had good to excellent overall cosmesis. Infection was observed in only 2.9% of patients, and symptomatic seroma was reported in only 1.9%. CONCLUSION: Use of the CMLB for APBI delivery is associated with acceptable long-term local control and toxicity. Local recurrence-free survival was 97.8% at 3 years. Significant (grade 3) toxicity was uncommon, and no grade 4 toxicity was observed. Treatment at high-volume centers was associated with decreased late toxicity.",eng,0

However, skin distance only approximates the skin dose. With a single lumen device, the dose will depend not only on skin thickness but also on balloon diameter and dwell position location/weighting. On the currently accruing national phase III trial (RTOG 04-13/NSABP B-39), treatment is considered acceptable if the maximum skin dose is <145% of the prescription dose. This dose was not based on patient outcome data but was chosen as it corresponds to the dose delivered to the skin with a small balloon of average diameter with a skin distance of 5-6 mm. No publications have as yet described the relationship between actual maximum skin dose and outcome with either interstitial or balloon brachytherapy. This report is a detailed analysis of the maximum skin dose delivered with breast brachytherapy and late toxicity in a large cohort of patients with prolonged followup. Materials and Methods: 96 patients treated with breast brachytherapy from 2000-2007 for which complete planning and followup data were available were included in this analysis. Median followup was 41 months (range 15-100 months). 40 patients were treated with multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, and 56 were treated with MammoSite. The maximum doses delivered to the skin and chest wall were obtained from the 3D treatment planning system. Outcome measures including overall cosmesis, hyperpigmentation, edema, telangiectasia, pain, and fibrosis were recorded. A multivariate statistical analysis was performed to determine the relationship between the maximum doses delivered to the skin and chest wall and the outcome variables. Results: Treatment was well tolerated, with 98% of patients experiencing good to excellent cosmesis. Chronic edema or significant pain occurred in only 1% and 4.2% of patients, respectively. Moderate to severe hyperpigmentation occurred in 12.5%. Moderate to severe fibrosis occurred in 12.5%. Any degree of telangiectasia was observed in 3.3%. The maximum dose delivered to the chest wall was not associated with any outcome measures. The maximum dose delivered to the skin was significantly associated with the incidence of telangiectasia (p=0.0018) and with the incidence of moderate to severe fibrosis (p=0.0216). The incidence of fibrosis was significantly increased when the dose to the skin exceeded 4.07 Gy (120%). Conclusions: The present dosimetric guidelines used for planning breast brachytherapy are not based on actual patient outcome data. This investigation demonstrates that the maximum skin dose delivered is associated with telangiectasia and fibrosis. The development of fibrosis in patients with higher skin doses may result from the associated dose to the subcutaneous tissue. These results suggest that patients may benefit if more rigorous constraints are applied and if the skin dose is reduced as low is as achievable. The newer multi-lumen intracavitary devices may allow the control of skin dose while preserving target coverage.",,0

Arthur,2005.0,CT-guided multi-catheter insertion technique for partial breast brachytherapy: reliable target coverage and dose homogeneity,10.1016/j.brachy.2004.11.002,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and dosimetric reliability of a CT-guided method of catheter insertion for accelerated partial breast brachytherapy (APBB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1995 to 2002, 77 patients were treated with APBB using a multi-catheter low-dose-rate or high-dose-rate approach. Within that timeframe, 29 patients with early stage invasive breast cancer were treated with high-dose-rate partial breast brachytherapy and had CT scans of the brachytherapy implant available for analysis. Initially, catheter insertion was accomplished in the operating room at the time of lumpectomy using standard free-hand insertion techniques under fluoroscopic guidance and subsequent orthogonal film dosimetry. To improve the efficiency and quality of the technique, the procedure was moved to the departmental CT-simulation suite where the catheters were placed with CT guidance. Basic guidelines of needle insertion and implant construction were followed to assure appropriate intercatheter and interplanar spacing that allowed optimal dosimetric coverage of the target volume. Target volumes were delineated and a treatment plan generated using a 3D planning system (Varian Brachyvision). PTV 1 cm was defined as the lumpectomy cavity plus 1 cm and PTV 2 cm as the lumpectomy cavity plus 2 cm. Target coverage goals were set as delivery of 100% of the prescribed dose to >95% of PTV 1 cm and >90% of the dose to >90% of PTV 2 cm. Dose homogeneity index (DHI) was defined as (V150%-V100%/V100%) with a goal of achieving >0.75. Fifteen patients were treated using the initial method and 14 patients using the CT-guided technique. Targets were retrospectively entered in the initial group and dose volume histogram analysis completed on all patients. The ability of each technique to achieve the target coverage and homogeneity goals was compared. RESULTS: With the change from traditional techniques to a CT-guided technique, the percentage of patients satisfying all dosimetric goals increased from 42% to 93%. Mean dose coverage (defined as the percentage of PTV 2 cm receiving 90% of the prescribed dose) increased from 89% to 95% (p=0.007) and the mean DHI increased from 0.77 to 0.82 with the new technique (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Reproducible target coverage and dose homogeneity were achieved with CT-guided catheter insertion and 3D planning software. Catheters can be optimally placed with intraoperative CT evaluation and 3D planning software allows improved implant visualization resulting in optimized dosimetry. Improvements in target coverage and DHI may translate into optimized local control and improved cosmesis with a corresponding reduction in the risk of complications.",eng,0

This investigation compared the ability to control skin and chest wall doses between patients treated with multicatheter (MC), Contura multilumen balloon (CMLB), and MammoSite (MS) brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 43 patients treated with the MC technique, 45 patients treated with the CMLB, and 83 patients treated with the MS were reviewed. The maximum doses delivered to the skin and chest wall were calculated for all patients. RESULTS: The mean maximum skin doses for the MC, CMLB, and MS were 2.3 Gy (67% of prescription dose), 2.8 Gy (82% of prescription dose), and 3.2 Gy per fraction (94% of prescription dose), respectively. Although the skin distances were similar (p = 0.23) for the two balloon techniques, the mean skin dose with the CMLB was significantly lower than with the MS (p = 0.05). The mean maximum rib doses for the MC, CMLB, and MS were 2.3 Gy (67% of prescription dose), 2.8 Gy (82% of prescription dose), and 3.6 Gy per fraction (105% of prescription dose), respectively. Again, the mean rib dose with the CMLB was significantly lower than with the MS (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The MC and CMLB techniques are associated with significantly lower mean skin and rib doses than is the MS. Treatment with the MS was associated with significantly more patients receiving doses to the skin or rib in excess of 125% of the prescription. Treatment with the CMLB may prove to yield less normal tissue toxicity than treatment with the MS.",eng,0

Accelerated partial breast irradiation limits the radiation target to the volume of tissue immediately surrounding the lumpectomy cavity and reduces the overall treatment time from approximately 6 weeks to 5 days. Balloon brachytherapy was introduced in 2000. Since that time, several clinical experiences have demonstrated excellent outcomes in carefully selected patients. Modern intracavitary brachytherapy offers patients with early-stage breast cancer a promising new option for radiation therapy.

This formalism, based on a water approximation, neglects various heterogeneous materials present during treatment. Various studies have suggested that these heterogeneities should be taken into account to improve the treatment quality. The present study sought to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating Monte Carlo (MC) dosimetry within an inverse planning algorithm to improve the dose conformity and increase the treatment quality. Methods and Materials: The method was based on precalculated dose kernels in full patient geometries, representing the dose distribution of a brachytherapy source at a single dwell position using MC simulations and the Geant4 toolkit. These dose kernels are used by the inverse planning by simulated annealing tool to produce a fast MC-based plan. A test was performed for an interstitial brachytherapy breast treatment using two different high-dose-rate brachytherapy sources: the microSelectron iridium-192 source and the electronic brachytherapy source Axxent operating at 50 kVp. Results: A research version of the inverse planning by simulated annealing algorithm was combined with MC to provide a method to fully account for the heterogeneities in dose optimization, using the MC method. The effect of the water approximation was found to depend on photon energy, with greater dose attenuation for the lower energies of the Axxent source compared with iridium-192. For the latter, an underdosage of 5.1% for the dose received by 90% of the clinical target volume was found. Conclusion: A new method to optimize afterloading brachytherapy plans that uses MC dosimetric information was developed. Including computed tomography-based information in MC dosimetry in the inverse planning process was shown to take into account the full range of scatter and heterogeneity conditions. This led to significant dose differences compared with the Task Group report 43 approach for the Axxent source. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,0

This study aims to develop a treatment planning system (TPS) for IORT based on pre-treatment CT images and pre-calculated Monte Carlo dose distributions. The TPS should allow the selection of the appropriate energy, applicator diameter and beveling angle, position and incidence angle of the beam. Based on this information the dose distribution should be calculated in a reasonably short time in order to be used during the pre-treatment simulation phase as well as in the surgical room. Materials: The TPS has been developed using the results of Monte Carlo simulations in water using EGSnrc/BEAMnrc for the Light Intra-Operative Accelerator (LIAC, SORDINA, Italy). A look-up table of dose distributions, one for each energy, applicator diameter and beveling angle has been calculated in water in a cartesian grid with a 2mm resolution and stored in a database. The TPS allows to import the CT images in DICOM format from any scanner, delineate Regions of Interest (ROIs) and reconstruct a 3D model of the patient and the accelerator to easily select the optimal ballistic. For each ROI an arbitrary electronic density can be assigned in order to mimic missing tissue (surgically removed) or protective devices, such as a protection discs. A fast ray tracing algorithm has been applied in order to obtain the dose distribution in the patient taking into account the in-homogeneities from CT images, based on a appropriate calibration curve. The code has been written in Assembler in order to reduce as much as possible the computational time as well as to improve graphical performances. The software has been tested on two mathematical heterogeneous phantoms (with density in-homogeneities) and on the CT images of 4 patients, one for each of the tumour sites/pathologies that most frequently require a IORT treatment (breasts, head and neck, prostate and sarcomas). Calculation times have been registered. Results: Snapshots of the 3D graphical environment and of a calculated distribution are shown in the figure below. The agreement between the dose distribution calculated with Monte Carlo and the TPS is within 1% and 7% for homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms respectively. Calculation times have always been less than 4 minutes. (Figure presented) Conclusions: The software has been proven to be easy to use in handling patient images, in delineating ROIs, in selecting the optimal beam ballistic and in evaluating the expected dose distributions. Calculation times are consistent with routine use in the surgical room.",,0

Methods: From July 2006 to December 2009, 226 patients suitable for BCT were enrolled in a phase II trial with IOERT as radical treatment immediately after surgical resection. All patients had biopsy-proven cancer. After the surgeon temporarily re-approximated the excision cavity, a dose of 21 Gy using IOERT was delivered to the tumor bed with a margin of 2 cm laterally. Results: No acute reactions were reported after irradiation. Three patients experienced a transient edema. In 7 others a haematoma was observed. No cases of liponecrosis were observed. With a mean follow-up of 49 months (range 31-66 months), only one case of local recurrence has been reported. The observed toxicity was considered acceptable. As to cosmetic results, at 6 months after the end of IORT, 71/226 patients (31.4.%) had a score of 2 for symmetry and contour (asymmetry exhibited by 1/3 or less of volume breast), while 19/226 (8.4%) had a score 3 (asymmetry greater than 1/3 of breast volume). These findings remained unchanged at the following examinations. No breast oedema, discoloration at site or scar prominence were observed. Conclusions: IOERT offers the advantage of an excellent delineation of the tumor bed under visual control and high sparing of normal tissue, including the skin. IOERT delivers a very high biologically dose at the time of the surgery, when residual tumor cells are more rapidly proliferating. IOERT is insensitive to chemotherapy sequencing since all of the radiation is given during the surgery. The absolute recurrence rate of 0.4% and the recurrence rate per year of 0.2% of the present study are very encouraging. APBI using a single dose of IOERT can be delivered safely in women with early, low-risk breast cancer.

Despite the positive evidence and outcomes for breast-conserving therapy (BCT), many women are unable or unwilling to undergo 5-7 weeks of external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT). We report the results of a single-institution phase II trial of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using a single dose of intraoperative electron radiotherapy (IOERT) in patients with low risk early stage breast cancer. Methods and materials: From July 2006 to December 2009, 226 patients suitable for BCT were enrolled in a phase II trial with IOERT as radical treatment immediately after surgical resection. All patients had biopsy proven cancer. After the surgeon temporarily re-approximated the excision cavity, a dose of 21 Gy using IOERT was delivered to the tumor bed with a margin of 2 cm laterally.

These findings remained unchanged at the following examinations. No breast oedema, discoloration at site or scar prominence were observed. Discussion: IOERT has significant advantages compared to other post-operative APBI approaches. The surgical re-approximation of the tumor bed, combined with the high quality of electron beam radiation, generates substantially more uniform dose distributions. IOERT offers the advantage of an excellent delineation of the tumor bed under visual control and high sparing of normal tissue, including the skin. IOERT delivers a very high biologically dose at the time of the surgery, when residual tumor cells are more rapidly proliferating. IOERT is insensitive to chemotherapy sequencing since all of the radiation is given during the surgery. IOERT offers low-risk women the possibility of a one-day procedure to treat their cancer and preserve their breast. The results of our study are very encouraging compared with other series with IOERT or APBI. The absolute recurrence rate of 0.4% and the recurrence rate per year of 0.2% of the present study are lower compared to the ones from the largest series with IOERT ever published (3.6% and 1.2%, respectively) (1). Conclusion: APBI using a single dose of IOERT can be delivered safely in women with early, low risk breast cancer. A longer follow-up is needed to ascertain its efficacy compared to that of the current standard treatment of whole breast irradiation.",,0
Journal Article,J. M. Daly; J. J. Decosse,1984.0,Horizons in surgical oncology,", ","Future horizons in surgical oncology relate to advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the patient with cancer. New diagnostic modalities may make complete surgical staging unnecessary. Perioperative support of patients given multimodality treatment will become more critical as the limits of surgical resection are reached and combined treatment with radiation and chemotherapy become more frequent. The current treatment of cancer at several organ sites reflects the evolving approach to treat both local and systemic manifestations of the malignancy. Use of intraoperative radiation therapy with electron-beam and/or brachytherapy has been proved safe and future prospective trials will determine efficacy in local control of disease.

We hypothesized that the two techniques would produce equivalent doses under pre-established conditions of activity and exposure time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simulations of implants with (99m)Tc-filled and HDR (192)Ir-filled balloons were performed with the Siscodes/MCNP5, modeling in voxels a magnetic resonance imaging set related to a young female. Spatial dose rate distributions were determined. In the dosimetric analysis of the protocols, the exposure time and the level of activity required were specified. RESULTS: The (99m)Tc balloon presented a weighted dose rate in the tumor bed of 0.428 cGy.h(-1).mCi(-1) and 0.190 cGyh(-1).mCi(-1) at the balloon surface and at 8-10 mm from the surface, respectively, compared with 0.499 and 0.150 cGyh(-1).mCi(-1), respectively, for the HDR (192)Ir balloon. An exposure time of 24 hours was required for the (99m)Tc balloon to produce a boost of 10.14 Gy with 1.0 Ci, whereas only 24 minutes with 10.0 Ci segments were required for the HDR (192)Ir balloon to produce a boost of 5.14 Gy at the same reference point, or 10.28 Gy in two 24-minutes fractions. CONCLUSION: Temporary (99m)Tc balloon implantation is an attractive option for adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer, because of its availability, economic viability, and similar dosimetry in comparison with the use of HDR (192)Ir balloon implantation, which is the current standard in clinical practice.

The main advantage of brachytherapy compared with external beam radiation (EBR) is the improved localized delivery of dose to the target volume of interest, thus normal tissue irradiation is reduced. The precise and targeted nature of brachytherapy provides a number of key benefits for the effective treatment of cancer such as efficacy, minimized risk of side effects, short treatment times, and cost-effectiveness. Brachytherapy devices have yielded promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. However, brachytherapy can only be used in localized and relatively small tumors. Although the introduction of new delivery devices allows the treatment of more complex tumor sites, with wider range of dose rate for improving treatment efficacy and reduction of side effects, a better understanding about the safety, efficacy, and accuracy of these systems is required, and further development of new techniques is warranted. Therefore, this review focuses on the delivery devices for brachytherapy and their application in prostate, breast, brain, and other tumor sites. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",,0

Harris,1992.0,Are cosmetic results following conservative surgery and radiation therapy for early breast cancer dependent on technique?,", ","To assess the cosmetic results in relation to treatment technique, we retrospectively reviewed the results for 1159 Stage I-II breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy between 1970-1985. All patients underwent gross excision followed by radiation therapy including an implant or electron beam boost. The total dose to the primary site was greater than or equal to 60 Gy. Because of technical modifications introduced over time after 1981, the population was divided arbitrarily into two cohorts: 504 patients treated through 1981 and 655 treated between 1982-1985. Median follow-up time for surviving patients in the two cohorts were 107 months and 67 months, respectively. Cosmetic outcome was evaluated by the examining physician and scored as excellent, good, fair or poor. Excellent results at 5 years were scored in 59% of early cohort patients and 74% of the latter cohort (p = 0.002). Acceptable results (either good or excellent) were seen in 84% and 94%, respectively (p = 0.02). In the latter cohort, the likelihood of achieving an excellent result, but not an acceptable result, was significantly related to the volume of resected breast tissue and the use of chemotherapy. The number of fields (three-field technique, provided that fields are precisely matched, compared to tangents only) and boost type (implant vs electrons) did not influence the cosmetic outcome. We conclude that our current technique using breast RT to 45-46 Gy and a boost to the primary site of 16-18 Gy is associated with a high likelihood of acceptable cosmetic results and that this likelihood is not diminished by the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, a large breast resection, the use of a third field, or boost type.",eng,0

It allows wide excisions and prevents breast deformities by immediate reconstruction of large resection defects. The procedures are mostly useful for resection of 20-40% of the breast -a group of patients normally treated by mastectomy in the past. Four features are integral to oncoplastic breast surgery: (i) Appropriate surgery for cancer excision. (ii) Partial reconstruction to correct wide excision defects. (iii) Immediate reconstruction with the full range of available techniques. (iv) Correction of volume and shape asymmetries relative to the contra-lateral healthy breast. There are two fundamentally different approaches: (i) volume-replacement procedures, which combine resection with immediate reconstruction by using local flaps (glandular, fasciocutaneous, and latissimus dorsi mini-flaps), and (ii) volume-displacement procedures, which combine resection with a variety of different breast reduction and reshaping techniques, according to the location of the tumor. Oncoplastic surgery increases the oncological safety of breast-conserving treatment because a much larger breast volume can be excised and wider surgical margins can be achieved. Moreover, a surgical screening"" of the contra-lateral breast allows the diagnosis of occult cancers. Among oncoplastic approaches, a very unique technique is the possibility of implant use (augmentation mammaplasty) in case of quadrantectomy and simultaneous delivery of intraoperative radiotherapy to the tumor bed. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.""",,0

Vicini,1997.0,The use of ultrasonography in the localization of the lumpectomy cavity for interstitial brachytherapy of the breast,", ","PURPOSE: To determine the value of breast ultrasonography (US) in defining the lumpectomy cavity for patients treated with interstitial brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In March 1993, a protocol of low dose rate (LDR) interstitial brachytherapy as the sole radiation modality in selected patients with early breast cancer was initiated at William Beaumont Hospital. To date, 60 patients have been entered in this protocol, and 38 have undergone US assisted placement of interstitial brachytherapy needles. The lumpectomy cavity was outlined in all dimensions and corresponding skin marks were placed for reference at time of implantation. These US dimensions were compared to the physician's clinical estimate of the location of the lumpectomy cavity, the patient's presurgical mammogram, and the position of the surgical scar. In the intraoperative setting, the dimensions of the lumpectomy cavity were also obtained and the placement of the deep plane of interstitial needles was verified by US. RESULTS: The full extent of the lumpectomy cavity was underestimated by clinical examination (physical exam, operative report, mammographic information and location of the surgical scar) in 33 of 38 patients (87%). The depth to the chest wall was also incorrectly estimated in 34 (90%) patients when compared to US examination. Intraoperatively, US was performed in nine patients and was useful in verifying the accurate placement of the deepest plane of interstitial brachytherapy needles. In 7 of 9 patients (75%), clinical placement of needles did not ensure adequate coverage of the posterior extent of the lumpectomy cavity as visualized by intraoperative US. CONCLUSIONS: In breast cancer patients considered for interstitial brachytherapy, US appears to be a more accurate means of identifying the full extent of the lumpectomy cavity when compared to clinical estimates. In addition, US allows real-time verification of needle placement in the intraoperative setting.",eng,0

The intent of treatment in the majority of these patients with metastatic disease is palliation, which can be achieved in most patients with moderate-dose radiation treatment. Occasional patients with solitary metastatic disease, favorable survival prospects, or histologies that do not respond well to radiation may benefit by aggressive surgical intervention, as may patients with progressive or recurrent disease after prior radiation therapy. For the less common occurring primary tumors of the spine and paraspinal soft tissues, the oncologic goal of achieving a resection with negative"" (tumor-free) margins through a surgical approach that does not violate tumor or pseudocapsule can be difficult to achieve, primarily because of the close anatomic proximity of the dura and spinal cord. Widely ""negative"" margins are rarely achieved. It is worth noting that tumors arising in other anatomic sites such as the extremities, urinary bladder, and the breast have been effectively treated with gross resection of tumor in conjunction with radiotherapy to achieve high rates of local tumor control. The use of this strategy for treatment of spinal tumors has been limited in the past by the ability of surgeons to achieve a gross resection of tumor and radiation oncologists to deliver effective doses of radiation. Gross resection of tumor has long been seen to be important in control of these tumors and has become more readily achievable in recent years by oncologic surgeons with spine tumor expertise. Recent advances in radiation treatment technology have allowed significant radiation dose escalation to tumors abutting the dura; these developments appear to be improving the treatment outcome in this patient group. Novel radiotherapy approaches including intensity modulated radiation therapy, intraoperative radiation therapy, brachytherapy (placement of radiation sources into or around tumor), and proton beam radiation therapy will be reviewed. © 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.""",,0

Materials: Between June 2004 and December 2005, 96 premenopausal women with a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer were treated with breast-conserving surgery. During surgery, an electron intraoperative therapy boost of 12 Gy was administered to the tumour bed. Adjuvant local treatment was completed with HEBRT, consi sting of 13 daily fractions of 2.85 Gy to the whole breast to a total dose of 37.05 Gy. HEBRT was performed using 3-dimens ional conformal radiotherapy technique based on the computer tomography scan simulation. During the first treatment all patients had in vivo dosimetry and a portal verification. HEBRT started between 16 and 36 days after surgery (median 22 days). Adjuvant systemic treatment consisted of chemot herapy for 13 patients, chemo and endocr ine therapy for 33 patients, endocrine treatment only for 49 while one patient did not receive any systemic treatment. In all cases, adjuvant chemotherapy was started after the completion of HEBRT. After the end of the treatment all patients underwent follow-up visits every 6 months with the breast surgeon. Late toxicity using SOMA/LENT criteria for breast and skin was recorded at 6, 12 and 24 months from the end of HEBRT. Results: late toxicity data is available for 74 (77%) of the 96 patients. Median follow-up was 12.4 months (range, 6-53 months). late toxicity included fibrosis (GO44.6%; Gl 37.8%; G2 17.6% G3 0%); atrophy (GO 66.2%; Gl 28.4%, G2 5.4%; G3 0%); breast oedema (GO 75.7%; Gl 18.9%; G2 5.4%; G3 0%); leleangec1asy (GO 90.5%; G1 5.4 %; G2 4.1%; G3 0%) and arm oedema,(GO 98.6%; Gl 1.4%; G2 0% G3 0%).

This study is specifically addressed to postmenopausal patients not deemed suitable for full-dose intraoperative radiotherapy due to histological and biomolecular parameters of high-aggressiveness preoperatively gathered. This scheme has been developed on the basis of the favorable experience of regimen including IORT + 13-fraction external WBRT, dedicated to premenopausal women, which has been applied since 2004 at the European Institute of Oncology Materials and Methods: The study consists of an anticipated boost with intraoperative electrons, delivering a dose of 12 Gy at 90% isodose , to the tumor bed during surgery, followed , after 3 weeks, by short-course WBRT. The external radiotherapy schedule consists of 4 Gy/fraction in 8 fractions over 1 week and a half. The enrolled population includes postmenopausal early breast cancer patients undergoing conservative surgery (T1-T2, No-N1). The external treatment is delivered using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), exploiting the advantage of Tomotherapy modality direct. The primary endpoint is based on acute toxicity (proportion of patients with severe side effects within 6 months of treatment completion measured with RTOG scale), the secondary endpoints on chronic toxicity and cosmesis. The toxicity resulting from the administration of ELIOT boost + short-course WBRT will be investigated through the 'optimal Simon's'two-stage design' for stage II clinical trials. The assessment of toxicity is done in two stages. The first stage consists of 73 patients. The second stage consists of 104 patients to a total of 177 patients. Results: We reported the acute toxicity data on the first 16 patients treated between May 2012 and October 2013. All patients completed the planned radioterapy course. The mean and the median volume of the breast receiving more than 95% % of the prescribed dose was 97.1% and 99% , respectively (range 86- 100%).

Methods and Materials: The applicator consists of an inflatable silicone balloon reservoir attached to a positionable catheter that is intraoperatively implanted into the resection cavity and postoperatively filled with a liquid radionuclide solution. A simple dosimetric model, valid in homogeneous media and based on results from Monte Carlo photon-transport simulations, was used to determined the dosimetric characteristics of spherical geometry balloons filled with photon- emitting radionuclide solutions. Fractional depth-dose (FDD) profiles, along with activity densities, and total activities needed to achieve specified does rates were studied as a function of photon energy and source-containment geometry. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated to compare idealized balloon-applicator treatments to conventional <sup>125</sup>I seed volume implants. Results: For achievable activity densities and total activities, classical low dose rate (LDR) treatments of residual disease at distances of up to 1 cm from the resection cavity wall are possible with balloon applicators having radii between 0.5 cm and 2.5 cm. The dose penetration of these applicators increases approximately linearly with balloon radius. The FDD profile can be made significantly more or less penetrating by combining selection of radionuclide with source-geometry manipulation. Comparisons with <sup>125</sup>I seed-implant DVHs show that the applicator can provide a more conformal therapy with no target tissue underdosing, less target tissue overdosing, and no healthy tissue 'host spots;' however, more healthy tissue volume receives a dose of the prescribed dosage or less. Conclusions: This device, when filled with <sup>125</sup>I solution, is suitable for classical LDR treatments and may be preferable to <sup>125</sup>I interstitial-seed implants in several respects. Manipulation of the dosimetric properties of the device can improve its characteristics for brain tumor treatment and may make it suitable for boosting the lumpectomy margins in conservative breast cancer treatment.",,0

The Intrabeam delivery system demonstrated similar recurrence to WBI with a lower toxicity profile on short-term follow up. Recently introduced in the United States, we report on our early surgical experience using the Intrabeam radiotherapy delivery system. Methods: Prospectively gathered ER-positive, clinically node-negative patients (pts) with invasive breast cancer <3 cm receiving IORT using Intrabeam were reviewed after IRB approval. IORT-related effects and early post-operative outcome were assessed. Results: Twenty-eight pts (median age 72.5 yrs) underwent lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) and concurrent IORT from 1/2011-7/2011. Ninety-three % of pts had invasive ductal histology with median tumor size of 0.95 cm (range 0.2-2.0). Subcutaneous tissue flaps were created in 68% to achieve skin-to-applicator distance >1 cm. IORT was delivered using a 3cm (79%) or 3.5cm (21%) applicator. All pts received 20 Gy IORT administered over a median duration of 25 minutes (range 15-25) with median operative time of 123 minutes (range 90- 153). Seven pts (28%) had close (<2 mm) or positive microscopic margins after treatment, for which 6 had re-excision. A negative microscopic final margin (>2 mm) was obtained in 96%. Three pts (11%) received additional WBI (close final margin with (+) SLN N=1, (+) SLN on IHC without ALND N=2), 11% received adjuvant chemotherapy. Physical exam findings at 1st post-operative follow up included: localized IORT-related hyperemia (46%), asymptomatic seroma (29%), and cellulitis (7%). The one pt with cellulitis required operative abscess drainage. Four pts received planned 6 month post-IORT breast ultrasound; 2 had evidence of an asymptomatic seroma. Conclusion: Early operative experience with IORT is well tolerated with low morbidity. Delivery of IORT adds moderate operative time, and may require creating subcutaneous tissue flaps. The addition of WBI may be necessary for positive residual margins or microscopic nodal disease in pts who do not undergo additional surgery.",,0
Journal Article,J. W. Denham; C. S. Hamilton; P. Cross,1991.0,"Breast conservation, the problem of treating the excision site effectively: physical criteria for the choice of technique used",", ","This paper examines how physical factors such as the depth of the excision cavity below the skin surface and its distance from the underlying lung may impact upon the choice between the use of an electron field (from a Varian Clinac 1800) or an implant (using a double plane of iridium-192 wires). Data have been derived from a phantom dosimetry experiment simulating different permutations of breast size and depth of excision cavity. An anthropomorphic female phantom with two different-sized wax breast phantoms has been used to simulate the clinical circumstances envisaged and isodose distributions have been estimated from an array of TLD readings. The biological significance of doses measured in skin and lung have been examined using the linear-quadratic (LQ) model. Both on physical and biological grounds, the results favour the implant under the experimental conditions adopted. The use of the electron beam to definitively treat the excision cavity (omitting breast tangents) to 60 Gy would result in unacceptable late effects in the skin and an observable incidence of pneumonitis if the excision cavity were near the chest wall. Small carcinogenic risks, particularly to the lung, are apparent with each modality, but may be moderated for the iridium-192 implant by a reduced carcinogenic potential associated with low-dose rate radiation. The use of the newer radionuclides iodine-125 and samarium-145, with less penetrating gamma ray emissions, might be preferred to iridium-192 from the point of view of bronchial carcinogenesis if definitive treatment of the excision cavity became widespread practice.",eng,0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 60 patients with breast cancer stage I or II, the excision cavity boundaries were marked by clips at surgery. Patients received a boost with brachytherapy (n = 51) or electron beam (n = 9) after whole breast irradiation. The boost target volume was first planned using clinical, mammography and operative information and its accuracy evaluated by screening the surgical clips and, if necessary, adjusting the field to encompass all clips and to include the scar. Dosimetry was retrospectively performed for each brachytherapy patient and for each surgical clip. RESULTS: It was necessary to modify the target volume field in 11 cases (18%). The average dose received by the surgical clips was 116.1% of the dose delivered to the reference isodose (median: 101.75%, range: 16-457%). However, dose heterogeneity was important in the same patient and between patients. CONCLUSION: Delineation of the boost target volume with surgical clips is more accurate than with clinical landmarks alone but this technique does not allow measurements of the clip-chest wall and clip-skin distances. Virtual simulation with CT-scan cuts is recommended for optimising boost planning.",fre,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1980 to 1990, 118 T1 and 171 T2 lesions of breast were treated definitively by radiotherapy, following conservative surgery. External irradiation dose of 45 Gy was delivered either with 2.5 Gy or 1.8 Gy per fraction to the entire target volume, plus boost to the primary tumor. Boost dose of 15 to 30 Gy was given to the primary tumor either with iridium-192 implants or electrons. The implant dose-rate varied between 20 cGy/hr to 160 cGy/hr. RESULTS: The minimum follow-up was of 12 months and maximum of 11 years (median: 56 months). Out of 273 tumors boosted with implants, the 270 patients were divided into five groups according to dose-rate as, groups 1 (20-29 cGy/hr, n = 17), group 2 (30-49 cGy/hr, n = 144), group 3 (50-69 cGy/hr, n = 69), group 4 (70-99 cGy/hr, n = 27) and group 5 (100-160 cGy/hr, n = 13). The local failure rate was significantly increased in the group of patients treated with implant dose-rate < 30 cGy/hr (p < 0.05). While the incidence of late normal tissue complications and poor cosmetic outcome was significantly higher in the group of patients treated with implant dose-rate > 100 cGy/hr (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The present analysis indicate that the implant dose-rate should be maintained between 30-70 cGy/hr to maximize local control and reduce the late normal tissue injury. Also the increase in dose per fraction of external irradiation while not influencing local control rate was crucial for incidence of late complications and cosmetic outcome.",eng,0

Radiations can stimulate the immune system via the early activation of cytokine cascades, which can greatly affect cellular radio-sensitivity. Our aim is to analyze inflammatory response induced by high ionizing radiation (IR) doses, generated by intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) treatment, to identify several potential targets that may influence cell radio-response. Methods: MCF10, MCF7 and MDA-MB231 BC cell lines have been exposed to high IR (23 Gray and 9 Gray), delivered by IORT treatments. Conditioned media (CM) were assayed at the time points: 0', 30', 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours, for production of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors by using Luminex technology. Results: We observed a very low cytokine concentration in MCF7 CM and a greater expression, of TH1 and TH2 cytokines, IL-7, G-CSF and MCP-1 in MCF10A CM. MDA-MB231 CM showed a reduced expression of TH1 and TH2 cytokines, IL-7, G-CSF, MCP-1 and an up-regulation of GM-CSF, IL-6 and IL-8 factors. Conclusions: Our results indicate that cytokine production in most cases is dose independent and time and cell type dependent. In particular, an over production at 24 hours after IORT treatment was observed. In addition, we speculate that MCF10A cells potentially exhibit an increased capacity to activate the immune system after IR exposure, and that MDAMB231 cells could have a role in radio-resistance phenotype through IL-6 and IL-8 high production activated by IR.",,0

Xoft Axxent electronic brachytherapyTM (eBX) is a novel method of accelerated partial-breast irradiation that utilizes an electronic source to produce x-rays. eBX does not require a high dose rate afterloader unit or a shielded vault and, thus, may appeal to a larger number of patients undergoing the accelerated partial-breast irradiation procedure. eBX is associated with a lower radiation dose to normal tissues and larger 'hot spots' than treatment with the MammoSite device.

The mobile nature of the XB controller, as well as, the limited shielding requirements make XB a logical modality to be utilized for intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). We report the initial results of the first trial to utilize XB to deliver IORT in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. Materials/Methods: The study population consists of 12 patients with early-stage breast cancer enrolled in a multi-center trial utilizing XB. Inclusion criteria included patients > 45 years of age, tumors < 3 cm, tumors with infiltrating ductal or DCIS histology, and patients with uninvolved lymph nodes by frozen section at the time of surgery. All patients had an ultrasound performed at the time of surgery to verify a minimum 1-cm of balloon-to-skin distance and evaluate the conformance of the balloon to the surrounding breast tissue. A pliable lead shield was placed over the chest wall before radiation treatment. Pre-loaded radiation plans for balloon inflation sizes of 40 cc, 50 cc, 60 cc, and 70 cc were utilized. The radiation prescription dose was 20 Gy delivered to the balloon surface. Results: The mean time to deliver the radiation was 22 minutes (range, 17-27 minutes). The total procedure time including lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, balloon catheter placement, XB controller calibration, radiation treatment, and closing was a mean time of 1 hour and 42 minutes (range, 1 hour 22 minutes - 2 hours 15 minutes). The mean balloon-to-skin distance by ultrasound for the 12 patients was 1.5 cm (range, 1.0 cm - 1.9 cm). All margins of excision were negative on final pathology. At a median follow-up of 15 months, overall cosmesis was rated as excellent in 10 of 12 patients and good in the remaining 2 patients. Three patients reported mild breast pain, 3 patients developed mild erythma of the skin, 1 patient developed grade 2 fibrosis, and 2 patients developed grade 1 fibrosis. To date, there have been no incidences of infection, fat necrosis, desquamation, or rib fracture. To date, no patient has developed a recurrence. Conclusions: IORT utilizing XB is feasible and can be accomplished in a total procedure time of approximately 2 hours. At short follow-up, XB IORT appears to be well tolerated.",,0

Nguyen,2004.0,Treatment volume and dose optimization of MammoSite breast brachytherapy applicator,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2003.10.046,"PURPOSE: Limited information has been reported on the dosimetry achieved with the MammoSite breast brachytherapy applicator. We present our results regarding the volume of treatment and a comparison of a single prescription point, single dwell position optimization technique with a six prescription point, multiple dwell position method. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 14, 2002 and February 28, 2003, 21 patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated using the MammoSite device. The treatment was delivered in 10 fractions of 3.4 Gy/fraction, b.i.d., with a minimum of 6 hours between the daily fractions. CT of the lumpectomy cavity was obtained both with and without the inflated balloon. A planning target volume was constructed using a three-dimensional planning system. A three-dimensional expansion of the balloon surface was performed using the chest wall and skin as limiting structures. The volume of the inflated balloon was removed from this volume, and the volume of tissue treated in each patient was determined. A sequential expansion in 1-mm increments around the empty lumpectomy cavity was performed until the closest equivalent volume to the planning target volume was obtained. The treatment for the patients in this study was planned using both a single prescription point, single dwell position optimization technique and a six-prescription point, multiple dwell position technique. The single prescription point method has been described in a previous publication. The six-prescription point method used six points placed 1 cm from the balloon surface. Four points are in a plane transverse to the balloon axis perpendicular to the axis of the catheter, and two points are placed along the axis of the catheter. The prescription points along the catheter axis are used to compensate for the decreased dose coverage owing to anisotropy dose distribution of the source. The Nucletron HDR Plato Brachytherapy planning system was used to optimize the source positions and dwell times. RESULTS: The volume of breast tissue treated by the MammoSite device was equal to the volume encompassed by a mean 1.6-cm (SD, 0.1) margin around the empty lumpectomy cavity. Compared with the single prescription point optimization method, the six prescription point method provided better dose coverage, with a mean percentage of volume receiving 90% of the prescription dose of 97.2% (SD = 2.1) vs. 89.5% (SD = 4.6) for the single-point method. The mean percentage of volume receiving 100% of the prescription dose was 88.9% (SD = 3.3) for the six-point method vs. 77.6% (SD = 6.1) for the single-point method. However, compared with the single-point method, the six-point optimization method resulted in treatment that was less uniform, with a mean dose homogeneity index of 0.62 (SD =.07) vs. 0.66 (SD =.08) for the single-point method. CONCLUSION: The volume of normal breast tissue treated by the MammoSite device is comparable to other methods of interstitial brachytherapy that treat a 1-2-cm margin of tissue around the excision cavity. The six-prescription point, multiple dwell position method improved dose coverage with a slight decrease in dose homogeneity. The six-point method offers greater reliability of dose coverage compared with the single-point method by providing an increased number of reference points.",eng,0

In addition, factors associated with cosmetic outcome and infection are analyzed. The study population consisted of 30 patients with early stage breast cancer treated using the MammoSite device from October 28, 2002, to February 13, 2004. Cosmetic outcome was analyzed for its association with the following parameters: volume of the balloon, balloon-to-skin distance, maximal skin point dose per fraction, V100 (percent of volume that received 100% of the prescription dose), V150 (percent of volume that received 150% of the prescription dose), and V200 (percent of volume that received 200% of the prescription dose). The occurrence of infection at the time of treatment and during follow-up was also recorded. At a median follow-up of 13 months (range 1-16 months), 53.3% of the patients (16/30) were reported to have an excellent cosmetic outcome and 40.0% (12/30) had a good cosmetic outcome. Excellent cosmetic outcome was associated with a greater mean balloon-to-skin distance compared to those who achieved a good cosmetic outcome (1.5 cm versus 1.2 cm) (p = 0.164). The mean V100, V150, and V200 of those in the excellent cosmetic outcome group were 92.1%, 34.5%, and 7.6% versus 93.0%, 34.7%, and 7.6% in the good cosmetic outcome group (p = 0.642, 0.926, and 0.853), The mean balloon volumes were 47.7 cm3 and 56.9 cm3, respectively (p = 0.063) in the excellent and good outcome groups. The mean maximal skin doses per fraction in the excellent and good outcome groups were 354.8 cGy and 422.3 cGy (p = 0.286), respectively. Infection occurred in 13.3% of the patients (4/30). An excellent or good cosmetic outcome was achieved in 93.3% of patients and infection occurred in 13.3% of patients treated with the MammoSite breast brachytherapy applicator.

Materials and Methods: We analyzed the planning computed tomography (CT) of 20 patients who underwent external WBI after having received an intraoperative boost of 12 Gy with electrons at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO, Milan, Italy). As per clinical practice, breast surgeons positioned 4surgical clips to mark the excision site (3 along the surgical breech and 1deeply on the fascia) after tumor removal and IORT delivery. Three weeks laterpatients had CT simulation to plan WBI. These images were processed in order tocreate a virtual CT scan with hidden clips. Clips were blurred using a fully automated MATLAB script (version 7.12.0, The MathWorks Inc) that appoint to each voxel of the clip contour a value obtained from a normal pseudo-random distribution with mean value corresponding to the mean value of a 3 mm outer ring of the clip (an example is in figure). Results: Mean (+/- standard deviation, SD)DICE values obtained in case of hidden and visible clips are 0,40 (+/- 0,17) and0,63 (+/- 0,10). MCD is 13,16 (+/- 8,16) mm in the first case, and 6,52 (+/- 5,10) mm in the second case. The increase of contours overlap and the decrease of mean MCD between operators was highly statistically significant (p<0.001, T-test). The mean (+/- SD) difference in volume size was 20 (+/- 19) cc and 32 (+/- 31)cc with and without the guidance of surgical clips (p-value=0.056). The first operator tended to outline greater volumes compared to the second one, but the difference between them decreased when surgical clips were made visible. Conclusions: The correct identification of the IORT boost region allows physicists to optimize dose distribution during ERT planning with great care of avoiding any hot spot in the area which has been already received one high-dose fraction during surgery. In addition, to our knowledge, itis the first analysis that investigates the role of surgical clips as guidance to radiation oncologist in the same series of patients, in two different conditions (with and without visible clips). In this study we demonstrated that inter-operator variability decrease with surgical clips aid. Further effort will aim to increase the sample-survey by recruiting a higher number of patients and operators, in order to enhance the interobserver analysis. An evaluation of intra-operator analysis is also foreseen as further development. (Figure Presented).",,0

This study compared the complication rates following mastectomy and immediate reconstruction with intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) angiography evaluation to those with clinical assessment only. METHODS: We performed a single-institution retrospective study of mastectomy patients who underwent immediate tissue expander-based reconstruction between September 2009 and December 2013. ICG angiography was adopted in March 2012. The rates of complications in the ICG and clinical assessment only groups were compared. Factors associated with complications were identified with the Fischer exact test and univariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were identified; clinical assessment only, 53 patients; ICG angiography, 61 patients. The overall complication rates were not significantly different between the two groups (ICG angiography, 50.8 %; clinical assessment, 43.4 %; p = 0.46). There was no significant difference in the rates of unexpected return to the operating room, cellulitis, hematomas, and seromas. The overall rates of flap necrosis were not significantly different (ICG angiography, 27.9 %; clinical assessment, 18.9 %; p = 0.28). However, the rates of severe flap necrosis were significantly lower with intraoperative ICG angiography (4.9 %) than with clinical assessment only (18.9 %, p = 0.02). On univariate analysis, breast weight (>/=500 g) was significantly associated with increased rates of severe flap necrosis (p = 0.04), whereas body mass index, age, smoking status, prior breast surgery, history of radiation therapy, and receipt of nipple-sparing mastectomy were not. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that the implementation of intraoperative ICG angiography was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of severe flap necrosis.",Eng,0

DESIGN: Prospective consecutive case series. SETTING: Tertiary multidisciplinary referral center. PATIENTS: Forty selected patients with invasive breast carcinoma undergoing breast conserving surgery and MammoSite device placement. INTERVENTIONS: Breast conserving surgery, sentinel and/or axillary node dissection, placement of the new balloon catheter applicator (MammoSite device), and APBI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Infection, early and late seroma, device explantation, time to initiating APBI, acute toxic effects on the skin, and cosmesis using the Harvard Scale. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients underwent MammoSite device placement at the time of lumpectomy; 1 patient underwent percutaneous device placement after lumpectomy. Nineteen patients (49%) had drainage catheters placed in the breast cavity at the time of lumpectomy. Wound infection developed in 3 patients (8%). Five devices (12%) were explanted because of unfavorable final pathological findings or infection. The mean time to the start of APBI in patients who did not undergo simultaneous drain placement was 7.2 days (range, 5-12 days), compared with 5.1 days (range, 3-8 days) in patients who did (P = .008). With a mean follow-up of 13.3 months (range, 2-28 months), patients completing APBI had limited toxic effects on the skin, with excellent or good cosmetic results in 39 patients (97%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of the MammoSite system in APBI has favorable short-term outcomes. Infection and radiation treatment delay are common and may warrant use of perioperative antibiotics and drain placement, respectively. A small number of patients who have device placement at the time of lumpectomy will require explantation because of unfavorable final pathological findings.

This approach involves local excision of the malignancy with tumor-free margins, followed by 5-7 weeks of external beam whole breast (WB) radiotherapy (XRT) to minimize the risk of an in-breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Though clearly beneficial, the extended course of almost daily postoperative radiotherapy interrupts normal activities and lengthens care. Additional options are now available that shorten the radiotherapy treatment time to 1-5 days (accelerated) and focus an increased dose of radiation on just the breast tissue around the excision cavity (partial breast). Recent trials with accelerated, partial breast irradiation (APBI) have shown promise as a potential replacement to the longer, whole breast treatments for select women with early-stage breast cancer. Current APBI approaches include interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary (balloon) brachytherapy, and accelerated external beam (3-D conformal) radiotherapy, all of which normally complete treatment over 5 days, while intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) condenses the entire treatment into a single dose delivered immediately after tumor excision. Each approach has benefits and limitations. This study covers over 2 decades of clinical trials exploring APBI, discusses treatment variables that appear necessary for successful implementation of this new form of radiotherapy, compares and contrasts the various APBI approaches, and summarizes current and planned randomized trials that will shape if and how APBI is introduced into routine clinical care. Some of the more important outcome variables from these trials will be local toxicity, local and regional recurrence, and overall survival. If APBI options are ultimately demonstrated to be as safe and effective as current whole breast radiotherapy approaches, breast conservation may become an even more appealing choice, and the overall impact of treatment may be further reduced for certain women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.",,0

Circumscribed wound infection occurred in one patient (4.3%). Only 3 patients (13%) experienced acute skin toxicity Grade 1. We observed no teleangiectasias or pigmentations. The cosmetic outcome at last follow-up visit was rated as excellent/good, in 82.6%, fair, in 13% and poor in 4.4% of patients, respectively. There was no evidence of disease recurrence after median follow-up of 43. 4 months. Systematic integration of the perioperative fractionated 3D CT-based HDR brachytherapy as a boost for patients with breast cancer after BCS is feasible and seems safe. It might be beneficial especially for women with high risk of local recurrence.",,0

There is limited data about the use and outcomes of IORT for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The objective of this study is to define early outcomes, toxicities, and adjuvant therapy of patients treated in a multi-institutional registry. Methods A multi-institutional retrospective data collection registry was created. Institutions using low-kilovoltage IORT for the treatment of breast cancer were invited to participate and enter data on patients treated prior to 2013. Patients with pure DCIS who were treated with IORT were analyzed as a subset of the total 1,086 patients enrolled. Results Nineteen centers entered data on patients treated from 2007 to 2013. Ninety-five patients entered in this registry were treated with lumpectomy and IORT for DCIS and were evaluated. The median age was 65 years with a mean follow-up of 1.3 years (range, 0.6-4.9 yr). The median size was 0.8 cm (range, 0.1 cm-2.5 cm). Most women had estrogen receptor positive (78%), progesterone positive (69%), and low-grade (73%) DCIS. The type of IORT performed was primary IORT (93%), as a secondary procedure (4%), or as a planned boost (3%). Adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) was given to 26% (n = 25) of patients. Nine patients had a margin re-excision and 5 had mastectomies. Anti-estrogen therapy was used in 44% of those treated. Complications were low and included seroma requiring aspiration (8%), hematoma (1%), and infection requiring IV antibiotics (2.6%). Local in-breast recurrence for DCIS occurred in 3 (3%) patients and 92 (97%) patients are disease-free at time of this analysis. Of the 3 reported local failures, 1 occurred out of quadrant (4 cm away from lumpectomy site), 1 occurred in a patient with positive margins who refused further surgery or WBRT, and 1 occurred in a 40-year-old premenopausal patient with high-grade DCIS. None of the patients with a recurrence received adjuvant WBRT. Two of the patients did receive adjuvant hormonal therapy. Conclusion This is the largest study to evaluate IORT for the treatment of breast DCIS. Short-term safety and oncologic results are favorable and suggest that IORT may be an emerging therapeutic option for select patients with DCIS. Continued follow-up of this unique registry will allow further insight into patient selection and to the oncologic safety of this approach.",,0

This study evaluated the population currently receiving IORT at our institution, the acute and long-term complication rates, as well as possible associated patient- and therapy-related factors. Method: We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective chart review of patients who underwent IORT delivered by the Zeiss Intrabeam System at our institution from 2009-2012. Radiation dose to the skin was measured using Nanodot dosimeter. Acute skin toxicity was determined using CTCAE version 3.0 and RTOG cooperative group common toxicity criteria. RTOG/EORTC was used to grade late radiation morbidity. Pearson's chi-square and Wilcoxon tests were used to assess the association of skin toxicity and clinical-pathologic factors. Results : Forty-six patients were identified. The median age was 68 years and median follow-up was 15 months. Thirty-six of patients had mobility deficits or previous radiation which precluded breast preservation with standard external beam radiation. Fifteen percent had serious medical co-morbidities. The median pathologic tumor size was 1.02 cm. All patients received 20 Gy prescribed to the applicator surface. The median applicator size was 4 cm. Seventy-five percent of patients had more than 1 operation (lumpectomy and re-excisions) prior to the Intrabeam delivery. Six percent of patients also received whole-breast radiotherapy due to positive axillary lymph nodes or close final margins. Thirty-nine percent of patients developed grade 2 toxicities, including wound healing difficulties and recurrent seromas. Acute Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed in 10% of the patients. Nine percent of patients had grade 3 or 4 late-radiation toxicity. There were no significant correlations between skin toxicity and depth of tumor from skin, number of procedures, applicator size, tumor size, or patient BMI. There was a trend toward complication with increased radiation skin dose (P = 0.06). One patient developed a local recurrence of breast cancer. Conclusions : At our institution, IORT made breast preservation an option for elderly, immobile, co-morbid patients, and patients who have had prior breast irradiation who would otherwise receive a mastectomy. Severe complication rates are similar to rates seen in external beam radiation. Moderate toxicities are common and could have a greater impact on this fragile patient population. No predictive factors of acute or long-term toxicity were identified. Decreasing the radiation dose to the skin may reduce acute and or late skin complications.",,0

Patient and tumor characteristics as well as the lumpectomy technique can influence patient eligibility for APBI. This report describes a lumpectomy procedure and examines patient, tumor, and surgical characteristics from a prospective, multicenter study of electronic brachytherapy.Methods: The study enrolled 65 patients of age 45-84 years with ductal carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, and 44 patients, who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were treated with APBI using the Axxent<sup> </sup>electronic brachytherapy system following lumpectomy. The prescription dose was 34 Gy in 10 fractions over 5 days.Results: The lumpectomy technique as described herein varied by site and patient characteristics. The balloon applicator was implanted by the surgeon (91%) or a radiation oncologist (9%) during or up to 61 days post-lumpectomy (mean 22 days). A lateral approach was most commonly used (59%) for insertion of the applicator followed by an incision site approach in 27% of cases, a medial approach in 5%, and an inferior approach in 7%. A trocar was used during applicator insertion in 27% of cases. Local anesthetic, sedation, both or neither were administered in 45%, 2%, 41% and 11% of cases, respectively, during applicator placement. The prescription dose was delivered in 42 of 44 treated patients.Conclusions: Early stage breast cancer can be treated with breast conserving surgery and APBI using electronic brachytherapy. Treatment was well tolerated, and these early outcomes were similar to the early outcomes with iridium-based balloon brachytherapy. © 2011 Dooley et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,0

Dosimetric data from the EBT treatment plans were compared with those based on iridium-192 HDR brachytherapy. Material and methods: Medical records of 63 patients with early stage breast cancer (Tis, T1a, T1b, T1c, and T2) who were treated post-lumpectomy with EBT alone or in combination with external beam radiation therapy were reviewed. The prescribed EBT dose was 34 Gy (10 fractions over 5 days, 3.4 Gy each) to 1 cm from the balloon surface. Dosimetry data from 12 patients were compared with these of treatment plans using an iridium-192 source prepared for the same 12 patients. Results: The majority of patients (90.5%) were older than 50 years and had one or more risk factors for breast cancer (80.6%). Tumor sizes were 0.1 cm to 3.5 cm (mean 1.3 cm). Median follow-up was 7 months (1 to 18 months) post-EBT. Balloon applicators were implanted 0 to 85 days (mean 13.4 days) post-lumpectomy/re-excision. The most common adverse events were erythema, rash dermatitis, and pain or breast tenderness. No recurrences were reported. Dosimetric analyses demonstrated comparable target coverage, increased high-dose regions, and a significantly reduced dose to the ipsilateral breast and lungs as well as the heart with EBT as compared with the iridium-192 treatment plans. Conclusion: This retrospective, multicenter study showed that postsurgical adjuvant radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer can be administered using the EBT system with similar toxicity outcomes to those reported with iridium-192 brachytherapy. EBT offers a convenient, portable, nonisotope alternative to HDR brachytherapy using iridium-192. © 2011 Dooley et al. publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",,0

Jenrette,2005.0,Chest wall dose in MammoSite breast brachytherapy: radiobiologic estimations of late complication risk based on dose-volume considerations,10.1016/j.brachy.2005.05.001,"PURPOSE: To estimate the risk of late effects in women treated with MammoSite brachytherapy (MBT), the balloon catheters of which were placed near the ribs. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Upon reviewing 93 plans, 16 patients (17%) treated with MBT were considered to have received a high chest wall dose (>or=120% isodose line in contact with a rib). A dose-volume histogram was generated for this rib, and its distance from the MBT balloon measured. Using the linear quadratic equation, the equivalent dose, delivered in 10 fractions, to the dose that causes a 5% and 50% risk of rib late effects at 5 years using 2Gy per fraction, was calculated to be 37 and 44Gy, respectively. The rib volume receiving greater than or equal to these doses (V37 and V44) was correlated to the balloon-to-rib distance. Chest wall signs, symptoms, and radiologic findings for all 16 patients were recorded. RESULTS: The median balloon-to-rib distance was 4.8mm. The median values of V37 and V44 were 13.5% and 3.3%, respectively. All patients with a V37>or=15% and V44>or=5% had a minimum balloon-to-rib distance of <5mm. Two patients reported treatment-related chest wall tenderness (both had balloons placed <5mm from the chest wall), but neither presented with radiologic complications. CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen patients considered to receive relatively high chest wall doses had less than one-third of their primary rib volume being exposed to the estimated TD 5/5 and TD 50/5 doses. Therefore, we estimate the risk of late effects in women treated with MBT, the balloon catheters of which placed near the ribs were negligible, and believe that MBT remains a safe and effective treatment for selected patients with early stage breast cancer.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred patients with Stage 0, I, or II adenocarcinoma of the breast underwent adjuvant therapy using MBT. A dose of 34 Gy, delivered in 10 fractions twice daily, was prescribed to 1-cm depth using (192)Ir high-dose-rate brachytherapy. Patients were assessed for acute toxicity on the day of therapy completion, 4 weeks after therapy, and at least every 3 months by radiation, surgical, and/or medical oncologists. All available data were reviewed for documentation of cosmesis and rated using the Harvard Scale. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 6 months (median = 24 months). RESULTS: Of 100 patients treated, 90 had adequate data and follow-up. Cosmesis was excellent in 62 (68.9%), good in 19 (21.1%), fair in 8 (8.9%), and poor in 1 (1.1%) patient. Using stepwise logistic regression, the factors that predicted for excellent cosmesis were as follows: the absence vs. presence of infection (p = 0.017), and the absence vs. presence of acute skin toxicity (p = 0.026). There was a statistically significant association between acute skin toxicity (present vs. absent) and balloon-to-skin distance (<8 vs. >8 mm, p = 0.001). Factors that did not predict for cosmesis were age, balloon placement technique, balloon volume, catheter days in situ, subcutaneous toxicity, and chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.

The 5- and 10-year survival rates (52.7% and 36.5%, respectively, for all patients) were directly correlated with the size and location of the breast tumor, and the extent of lymph node involvement. Locoregional recurrence was observed in 39.8% of the cases, metastasis alone in 26.8% of the cases, and a combination of local recurrence and distant metastasis in 14.5% of the cases. The local recurrences and metastases were directly correlated with the extent of locoregional involvement. Late complications and sequelae were mostly minor and occurred in less than 25% of the cases; severe sequelae occurred in no more than 2% of the cases. They depended on the initial tumor volume and the tumor dose. Our results, along with those in the literature, indicate that radiotherapy administered alone is a valid therapeutic option in breast cancer.",eng,0

Losken,2014.0,An outcome analysis of intraoperative angiography for postmastectomy breast reconstruction,10.1177/1090820x13514995,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative angiography is a useful tool for predicting both tissue perfusion during postmastectomy breast reconstruction and mastectomy flap and free flap survival. OBJECTIVES: The authors determine whether the routine use of laser-assisted indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence angiography (SPY Imaging; LifeCell Corp, Branchburg, New Jersey) in breast reconstruction decreases the incidence of complications and whether this new technology is cost-effective. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted for 184 consecutive patients who underwent breast reconstruction using intraoperative ICG angiography from April 2009 to December 2011 at Emory University (Atlanta, Georgia). The incidence of complications (including mastectomy skin necrosis, flap necrosis, fat necrosis, unexpected reoperations, infections, and dehiscence) among these patients was compared with data for 184 consecutive patients who underwent breast reconstruction at Emory University from October 2007 to April 2009, prior to the introduction of ICG angiography. Patient data recorded included age, body mass index, smoking status, and history of preoperative radiation as well as the timing and type of reconstruction, along with complications. The cost of unexpected reoperations for perfusion-related complications and associated hospital stays was calculated. RESULTS: The 184 patients who underwent procedures using ICG angiography imaging had a lower incidence of mastectomy skin necrosis (13% vs 23.4%; P = .010) and unexpected reoperations for perfusion-related complications (5.9% vs 14.1%, P = .009). The 184 patients who underwent procedures without ICG angiography had a higher mean degree of severity of mastectomy skin necrosis (2.22 vs 1.83 on a scale of 1-3; P = .065). There were no significant differences in the degree of flap necrosis, nipple necrosis, fat necrosis, dehiscence, infection, implant exposure, flap loss, seroma, hematoma, or the number of overall complications between the 2 groups. The use of ICG angiography saved patients an average of $610. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ICG angiography during postmastectomy breast reconstruction decreased the incidence and severity of mastectomy skin necrosis as well as the incidence of unexpected reoperations for perfusion-related complications.

This study demonstrates the necessity of IMN removal when suggested by intraoperative radioguided surgery detection. METHODS: From April 1998 to July 2000, 1273 patients underwent LM for breast cancer. LM was performed using the combined dye and radiocolloid technique. Patients were scanned operatively with a gamma probe over the IMN area, and most underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. Nodes were removed from patients in whom radioactivity was detected in the internal mammary area. RESULTS: Thirty of the 1273 (2.4%) patients mapped had at least one IMN removed. Twenty-two of 30 (73.3%) had inner quadrant lesions. Five of 30 (16.7%) patients had IMNs that were positive for metastatic disease. Three of these five had no metastatic spread to the axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN). One of thirty (3.3%) patients with IMN localization had neither hot nor blue nodes detected in an SLN procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Radioguided SLN detection should be attempted in the IMN basin with all tumors. If an IMN is identified, it should be removed. IMN biopsy is a feasible, low-risk procedure when directed by radioguided LM and provides a guide for radiotherapy for patients with positive IMNs.",eng,0

The recent 5-years results of the non inferiority trial TARGIT-A suggest that with a short follow-up the 5-years risk for local recurrence is greater for the IORT arm. Several options can be suggested to improve those results. Objectives We choose to enhance surgical comprehension of IORT with IntrabeamTM by performing in vivo measurements comparing to external dosimetry taking into account tissues heterogeneities using a preoperative CT scan. Material and Methods Nine patients enrolled in french randomised trial RIOP-InCA underwent IntrabeamTM procedure for breast cancer treatment. Each patient had a preoperative CT scan to simulate the treatment on a Monte Carlo platform using an x-ray source model; in order to calculate the dose actually delivered by the IntrabeamTM system which takes into account the tissues heterogeneities. In vivo measurements using thermoluminescent dosimeters are also performed to evaluate the dose to the skin. Comparisons are done between simulated and measured data. Relative depth dose curves are also compared. Results The median age was 68.3 years [58-87]. The mean maximal diameter of lumpectomy was 71.3 mm [50-125]. The median size was 10.8 mm [5-19] and the median margin status was 12.8 mm [2-32]. 2 patients had micro metastatic involvement of sentinel lymph node without axillary clearance. SBR score was 1 for 5 patients and 2 for 2 patients. All histological subtype were ductal, one patient presented associated DCIS. 6 patients presented luminal A phenotype, 2 luminal B and 1 luminal B with HER-2 neu over-expression. 2 patients received supplemental EBRT (HER-2 neu over expression and SLN micro metastatic involvement). 2 patients had adjuvant sequential chemotherapy and all had adjuvant ani-aromatase hormono-therapy. In vivo measurements on the skin using TLDs gives a mean dose of 1.3 Gy +/- 1.1 Gy [0.1-4.9 Gy] in comparison with external dosimetry which had a mean dose of 1.5 Gy +/- 0.8 Gy [0.3-6.2 Gy] at the same positions. No patient received a dose superior to the prescription of 6 Gy. Relative depth dose curves give a mean deviation of +36.7% +/- 24.8% and +50.6% +/- 16.8% in the tangential and perpendicular axes respectively from the manufacturer. Using the shielding allow a reduction of the dose by 10 concerning the ribs. Conclusions Results about the dose as a function of depth show clearly that we cannot consider breast as equivalent to water at this energy and may taking in account breast density .It seems to be important to spread the skin correctly from the incision, to recover carefully the applicator and use the shielding in order to avoid secondary effects as skin necrosis and ribs failures. Our X-ray source model allows to have realistic dose distribution wich hepls in better surgical comprehension of IORT particularly in the set up of the applicator.",,0

Journal Article,D. J. Eaton,2015.0,Electronic brachytherapy--current status and future directions,10.1259/bjr.20150002,"In the past decade, electronic brachytherapy (EB) has emerged as an attractive modality for the treatment of skin lesions and intraoperative partial breast irradiation, as well as finding wider applications in intracavitary and interstitial sites. These miniature X-ray sources, which operate at low kilovoltage energies (<100 kV), have reduced shielding requirements and inherent portability, therefore can be used outside the traditional realms of the radiotherapy department. However, steep dose gradients and increased sensitivity to inhomogeneities challenge accurate dosimetry. Secondly, ease of use does not mitigate the need for close involvement by medical physics experts and consultant oncologists. Finally, further studies are needed to relate the more heterogeneous dose distributions to clinical outcomes. With these provisos, the practical convenience of EB strongly suggests that it will become an established option for selected patients, not only in radiotherapy departments but also in a range of operating theatres and clinics around the world.",eng,0

Chamber calibration factors, N(K), and chamber correction factors, k(ch), were determined based on HVL, according to the IPEMB code of practice and addendum. Depth doses were also measured using an ionization chamber and GafChromic EBT film. HVL was measured as 0.85-1.30 mm Al across the range of applicator sizes. Values for N(K) and k(ch) were found to be similar for the two units and all INTRABEAM applicator sizes. Therefore, calibration of ionization chambers, radiochromic film and other relative dosimeters could be performed on the superficial unit. This has the advantage of higher dose rates and lower dependence on small variations in detector positioning. Depth dose measurements performed using film also agreed with chamber values, published and manufacturer data, giving a simple and robust method for commissioning and regular quality assurance.",,0

Methods: To investigate the shielding requirements for this unit, attenuation measurements were carried out with manufacturer-provided tungsten-rubber sheets, lead, plasterboard and bricks. A prospective environmental dose rate survey was also conducted in the designated theatre. Results: As a result of isotropic geometry, the scattered dose around shielding can be 1% of primary and thus often dominates measured dose rates compared with transmission. The absorbed dose rate of the unshielded source at 1 m was 11.6 mGy h<sup>-1</sup> but this was reduced by 95%with the shielding sheets. Measured values for the common shielding materials were similar to reference data for the attenuation of a 50 kVp diagnostic X-ray beam. Two lead screens were constructed to shield operators remaining in the theatre and an air vent into a service corridor. A lead apron would also provide suitable attenuation, although a screen allows greater flexibility for treatment operators. With these measures, staff doses were reduced to negligible quantities.

Method: Patients accrued to the TARGIT trial of intraoperative breast radiotherapy had tissue samples taken from the resection wall before and after delivery of 5-6 Gy of 50 kV X-rays. Samples were sectioned and stained for phosphorilated gammaH2Ax, representative of DNA repair, to assess sub-lethal damage (SLD) before and after irradiation. The proportion of stain was recorded on multiple slides spanning samples from 130 patients. Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations were used to determine the spectra of secondary electrons at the samples in situ. These spectra were used as input to a damage simulation code producing expected levels of lethal and SLD. In combination with expected repair rates, theoretical estimates of residual SLD at the end of irradiation were made based on the linear-quadratic model of radiation damage with repair. Results: Considerable variability was found in change in gammaH2Ax expression between pre and post-irradiation sections, though there is a trend for decreased accumulation with longer irradiation time, consistent with increased proportional repair. The theoretical results suggest a reduction in SLD with increasing applicator size due to both increased beam hardening and longer irradiation times. The resulting trends with applicator size are consistent with the experimental results. Conclusion: In vivo assessment of radiobiological modeling is rare and impeded by the practicalities and constraints of patient treatment. It is likely that insufficient time was available post irradiation for accumulation and equilibrium of gammaH2Ax. With potentially slow SLD repair and a diversity of cell types present in sections, larger numbers of patients may allow differences in in vivo normal tissue repair with dose-rate to be distinguished above levels of noise and uncertainty in both the measurements and the model.",,0

Two dosimetric models are considered-an analytical model considering only the primary x-ray beam, and a Monte Carlo model utilizing the EGSnrc code and a spherical simulation geometry. Both models prove reliable for verifying measured dose distributions for the device. The Monte Carlo model is necessary for examining spectral variations and the influence of inhomogeneities. The predictions of the Monte Carlo model are utilized to examine points of consideration for a multi-center clinical trial using the Intrabeam in the intra-operative, single fraction post-resection treatment of low-risk breast cancer.

In this study, a theoretical assessment was made of DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction in normal breast tissue after intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT), which is now an accepted form of adjuvant radiotherapy for selected patients with early breast cancer. DSB rates and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) were calculated as a function of dose, radiation quality and dose rate, each varying based on the applicator size used during IORT. The spectra of primary electrons in breast tissue adjacent to each applicator were calculated using measured X-ray spectra and Monte Carlo methods, and were used to inform a Monte Carlo damage simulation code. In the absence of repair, asymptotic RBE values (relative to <sup>60</sup>Co) were approximately 1.5. Beam-quality changes led to only minor variations in RBE among applicators, though differences in dose rate and overall dose delivery time led to larger variations and a rapid decrease in RBE. An experimental assessment of DSB induction was performed ex vivo using pre- and postirradiation tissue samples from patients receiving breast intraoperative radiation therapy. Relative DSB rates were assessed via gamma-H2AX immunohistochemistry using proportional staining. Maximum-likelihood parameter estimation yielded a DSB repair halftime of 25.9 min (95% CI, 21.5-30.4 min), although the resulting model was not statistically distinguishable from one where there was no change in DSB yield among patients. Although the model yielded an in vivo repair halftime of the order of previous estimates for in vitro repair halftimes, we cannot conclude that it is valid in this context. This study highlights some of the uncertainties inherent in population analysis of ex vivo samples, and of the quantitative limitations of immunohistochemistry for assessment of DSB repair.

The origin of seroma formation remains unclear. While intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) has been shown to be an alternative to whole breast irradiation, the influence on seroma production is unclear. Therefore, this analysis compares seroma production in patients with breast conserving surgery with or without IORT as tumour bed boost during breast conserving surgery. Method: A retrospective analysis of seroma production in patients with nodal-negative (pN0sn) pT1/2 primary breast cancer treated between September 2010 and October 2013 at the Breast Cancer Centre, University Hospital Ulm was performed. Patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, previous breast/axillary surgery or more than one intervention were excluded. IORT was applied as a tumour bed boost with 50-kV X-rays (Intra beam<sup></sup>) delivering 9 Gy at the applicator surface. Seroma formation was measured using wound drains placed in breast and in axilla. Results: Data of 152 patients (99 -IORT; 53 +IORT) were available for analysis. No significant differences between patients with or without IORT with regard to seroma production and number of days until drain removal were found (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: Patients with IORT encountered no increased seroma production and removal of the drains was not delayed compared to patients with breast conserving surgery only.

This is largely the result of new concepts tested in a steady stream of large, well-designed, coordinated clinical trials. Early trials showed that extended surgery (local therapy"") does not improve mortality over less aggressive surgery. Trials conducted in the 1970s and 1980s clearly showed that radical surgery involving removal of the breast provides no outcome advantage over breast-conserving therapy (BCT). One concern with BCT has been a higher rate of local recurrence compared with mastectomy, with initial studies before the routine use of systemic therapy reporting rates of 10% to 20% with BCT. Modern series define a risk of local recurrence after BCT of 2% to 5%, about the same as with mastectomy. The improvement is partly due to improved standards in surgery, radiation oncology, and pathology. However, it is primarily due to the use of systemic endocrine and chemotherapy. BCT is appropriate for most women with breast cancer. This article explores the advancements in breast surgery over the past 10 years.

Although the standard breast radiation regimen has historically been delivered over 5-7 weeks; more novel, shorter courses of breast radiation are currently being employed, offering the advantage of more convenience and less time-commitment. Herein, we review the recent literature substantiating these abbreviated radiation treatment approaches and the methods of delivery thereof. In addition, we discuss imaged guided techniques currently being utilized to further refine the delivery of adjuvant breast radiation therapy. © 2011 Sophia M. Edwards-Bennett et al.",,0

Peak age was 61-65 years' old and 56-60 years old, respectively for males and females. The most frequent primary site of disease for radiation therapy was the head and neck, followed by trachea, bronchus and lung, crevix uteri, breast, and esophagus. Frequency of squamous cell carcinoma was 38.0%; that of adenocarcinoma was 20.9%. Radical treatment was performed in 32.0% of patients in the first session, but this figure decreased to 24.7% for all sessions. There were many cases of secondary and primary palliative treatment, i.e., 31.8%. Radiotherapy was done in 70% of patients by megavoltage X-ray, with 9.4% treated by electron beam. Crude 5-year survival rates for each classification of malignant disease respective to the category of treatment policy from 1962 to 1978 were obtained.

Using time tracking to ascertain hours spent with each treatment technique Methods and Materials: As an alternative to the standard 6-week radiation protocol after breast-conserving surgery, Intraoperative Radiation therapy, promises comparable outcomes in early randomized trials. Other advantages of IORT versus external beam are overall treatment time, logistics, comfort, and quality of life in general. The literature lacks significant studies comparing IORT to conventional breast cancer therapy with regard to physician and radiation department workload. We did a series of time studies for nursing physician, physicist, therapist, dosimetrist and administrative staff to analyze the difference in these two techniques. Department members were asked to qualify and track time spent with treatment planning, scheduling, and coordination with other departments, QMP documentation and treatment delivery for these cases. We selected 10 cases of each type to analyze and averaged the data. We did not include post treatment care in this analysis or implementation efforts. Results: Department workload is increased for IORT when compared to a 7 week course of XRT. Physics time is increased due to QA of the machine and chargers for Intraoperative electronic brachytherapy as well as the need for second physics check due the high dose nature of treatment. Physician time is increased because of the variability of the OR schedules. There is more administrative time due to the coordination with other offices, patient's family, equipment issues and overall complexity when working with multiple departments and surgeons. The actual delivery time of treatment is 30- 40 minutes depending on balloon size but the physician and physics needsdesign chest wall shielding. There is increased time stress associated with the IORT procedure because the patient is anesthetized and the high treatment dose. Conclusions: Intraoperative radiation therapy close, multidisciplinary collaboration to assure excellent dose delivery. The coordination between radiation oncology and other departments is more time consuming than treatment delivery in a single department. Despite the treatment having only one fraction for the patient, the physician time is more than for 6 weeks of treatment and the physicist and ancillary staff time is increased due to QA/QMP issues. This is due to the complexity of treatment, the high dose of radiation given, and the Intraoperative nature that adds increasing time factors as well as the coordination of care and demand for quality assurance that is even in excess of any existing radiation oncology procedure.",,0

Two large, contemporary randomized trials have demonstrated breast intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) to be noninferior to whole breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) when assessing for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence in select patients. Additionally, IORT and other PBI techniques are likely to be more widely adopted in the future because they improve patient convenience by offering an accelerated course of treatment. Coupled with these novel techniques for breast radiotherapy (RT) are distinct toxicity profiles and unique cosmetic alterations that differ from conventional breast EBRT and have the potential to impact disease surveillance and patient satisfaction. This paper will review the level-one evidence for treatment efficacy as well as important secondary endpoints like RT toxicity, breast cosmesis, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and surveillance mammography following BCT with IORT.

By irradiating preoperatively this can lead to more accurate tumor delineation and smaller irradiated volumes. As the tumor remains in situ during irradiation, more precise delivery of the radiation dose is guaranteed with CT cone beam linear accelerators, avoiding the uncertainties of the original tumor position in the operation cavity as is the case in postoperative RT. Tumor excision 6 weeks after RT removes the high dose volume tissue and can lead to better cosmesis. B. By assessing tumor response to radiotherapy, an additional goal of the study is to develop a gene expression profile that predicts breast cancer radiosensitivity. This gene signature of breast radiosensitivity would further design optimal treatment strategies for individual breast cancer patients treated with BCT. Inclusion citeria: Patients 60 years or older with a cT< = 3cm, ductal carcinoma (no in situ component), unifocal on mammogram and MRI, pN0(sn) (sentinel node procedure before RT), will be treated by preoperative RT (CTV = GTV + 2 cm, 10 x 4 Gy IMRT/VMAT over two weeks). Six weeks after pre-operative RT, a wide local excision will be performed. Skin toxicity and fibrosis is scored using EORTC/RTOG criteria. Patients are followed during RT and on a 3-monthly basis. Cosmesis is scored and photographs are taken for analysis (BCCT.core project score). To study radiosensit ivity, gene expression profiling from RNA and DNA isolated from biopsies (mRNA gene expression profiles, the miRNA expression profiles and the DNA copy number changes) taken of the tumor before radiotherapy and at time of surgery will be correlated with response to radiotherapy, defined as pathologic response at the time of the lumpectomy. Response of the tumor will be evaluated by MRI scan and PET (before radiotherapy and before surgery) and classical pathology. Endpoint : The main objective is to investigate the impact of a short fractionated schedule given preoperatively on cosmesis and breast fibrosis. Therefore, it is anticipated that the percentage of moderate or severe fibrosis will decrease from 27% as found in the boost arm of the EORTC boost-no boost trial to 15% (Collette et al EJC 2008). The total sample size of 120 patients will provide in excess of 80% power to detect the difference between the null hypotheses (a rate of fibrosis of 27%) and the alternative hypothesis (a rate of fibrosis of 15%) with an exact binomial test at 0.05 2-sided significance level. In addition, the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion of patients without local recurrence will extend 0.035 from the observed proportion for an expected proportion of 96%. An additional objective is to build a classifier (genomic or proteomic or any kind of molecular signature) to identify responders and non-responders. A total of 120 patients will be included in the study. The main analysis will include 60 patients in the training set and 60 in the validation set.",,0

Methods and Materials: Patients < 60 years, T < 3 cm, pN0 (sn) (sentinel node procedure before RT), ductal carcinoma (no DCIS), unifocal on mammogram and MRI, undergo preoperative PBI (CTV = GTV + 2 cm, 10x4 Gy IMRT/VMAT over two weeks); 6 weeks hereafter a wide local excision is performed. Skin toxicity and fibrosis is scored using EORTC/RTOG criteria. Patients are followed during RT and on a 3-monthly basis. Cosmesis is scored and photographs are taken for analysis (BCCT.core project score). Results: From May 2010- 2013, 75 patients (pts) were included. For 52 pts follow up information is available up to at least 3 months after treatment; mean age 67.2 years (59-80); mean tumor size 1.4 cm (0.4-3.2); differentiation grade: grade I (n = 23), grade II (n = 24), grade III (n = 1), unknown (n = 4); mainly ER+PR+neu- (n = 48); 32 pts received hormonal therapy, 2 chemotherapy. No acute RT toxicity was seen. In the first year 9/52 pts developed localized oedema at the RT side fading away within 9 months. Postoperative complications were noted in 9/52 pts (17%): 2/52 had direct post-operative bleeding needing re-surgery; 1/52 developed a hematoma two months after surgery, needing re-surgery; 6/52 (11.5%) had a postoperative wound infection and received oral antibiotics. Of these 6, 1 wound abscess needing re-surgery, 1 small fistula closing within ten months. Fibrosis score at 1 year (n = 35): grade 0 (9), grade 1 (21), grade 2 (4) grade 3 (1). Cosmetic outcome was scored at 1 year (n = 49): excellent/good (37; 89%), fair (11; 22%) and poor in 1 patient. At 2 years follow up (n = 20): 18 (90%) patients excellent/good (n = 18; 90%) and fair in 2 (10%). Fibrosis was noted in a limited volume. One ipsi-lateral breast tumor recurrence was diagnosed after 12 months at skin entry of the biopsy tract. Discussion: The short term results of this PAPBI trial are promising in terms of acute treatment-related toxicities, complications and cosmetic outcome. Our complication rate of 17% (11% wound infection, 8% hematoma) is comparable with others [1]. Excellent or good cosmetic outcome was found in 90%, improving over time.

This has caused an increased interest in accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), because if radiation is delivered directly to the tumor bed there should be better local control. Patients greater than age 50 with core biopsy confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma were enrolled. They had preoperative ultrasound defining margins of less than 3.5 cm. Intraoperative ultrasound was also performed in an effort to ensure good surgical margins. After excision of the tumor, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with the Intrabeam System was delivered to the tumor bed. The procedure has been performed on 67 patients. Sixty-one patients had it with the original surgery, while 6 had the procedure after re-exploration of the segmental mastectomy site. Because of the final pathology (surgical margins, tumor biology, and nodal status) 4 patients later had total mastectomy and 11 received total breast irradiation. When total breast irradiation is done the IORT serves as the radiation boost. The cosmetic results have been good to excellent, and there have been no serious surgical or radiation complications. To date there have been no local failures. IORT with the Intrabeam System is feasible, user friendly, versatile, with few complications, good cosmetic results, and great patient acceptance.

The rationale for the evaluation was that local failure after breast conserving surgery (BCS) and total breast radiation usually occurs at the site of the original tumor and therefore delivering radiation directly to the tumor bed should result in better local control. Methods: Starting in 2004, patients over age 50 with invasive ductal carcinoma confirmed by core biopsy were enrolled. Preoperative MRI was used to rule out multifocal disease and ultrasound was used to define margins. Only patients with tumors less than 3.5 cm received intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT). In an effort to achieve adequate surgical margins intraoperative ultrasound was utilized. After resection of the tumor, IORT was delivered to the tumor bed with the Intrabeam System. Results: The procedure has been performed on 94 patients. Eighty-four patients had IORT with the primary surgery, while 10 had IROT during re-exploration of the segmental mastectomy site. Because of final pathology (surgical margins, tumor biology and/or nodal status) 4 patients later had total mastectomy and 18 received total breast irradiation. The IORT serves as the radiation boost when total breast irradiation was done. There have been no serious surgical or radiation complications. Cosmetic results were evaluated by the Harvard criteria and have been good to excellent. To date there have been no local failures. However, the follow-up is not long enough to determine the efficacy of preventing local recurrence. Conclusions: The IORT Intrabeam System is easy to use, versatile, accomplishes excellent cosmesis with few complications, and has great patient acceptance.

Our aim was to compare follow-up mammographic findings and rates of adjunctive ultrasound and biopsy between the two groups. Methods: Follow-up mammograms from TARGIT trial participants were independently reviewed by two radiologists blinded to the treatment received. Between-group differences were compared using chi-square test. Results: The cohort consisted of 141 patients (EBRT n=80/IORT n=61). Patient and disease characteristics were similar between the two groups, as were the number of follow-up mammograms and length of follow- up (EBRT/IORT n=2.0/2.4; 4.3yr/5.1yr; p=0.386). There were no significant differences in mammographic scar or calcification appearances of the post-operative site. However, increased breast density and generalised skin thickening were more common in the EBRT compared to the IORT group (p=0.002; p= 0.030 respectively). Ultrasound at follow-up was required slightly more frequently in the IORT group (15 of 61 (24.6%) versus 11 of 80 (13.8%)) but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.100). No disease recurrence was demonstrated on any of the breast biopsies taken. Only one biopsy was reported as fat necrosis in the IORT group. Conclusions: Generalised reactions on mammography are more common following EBRT compared with IORT. A slight, non-statistically significant increase in the need for ultrasound at follow-up was seen in the IORT group.

Our mathematical model of the stepwise development of breast cancer verifies the idea that the normal mutation rate in genes is only sufficient to give rise to a tumour within a clinically observable time if a high number of breast stem cells and TSGs exist or genetic instability is involved as a driving force of the mutation pathway. Furthermore, our model shows that if a mutation occurred in stem cells pre-puberty, and formed a field of cells with this mutation through clonal formation of the breast, it is most likely that a tumour will arise from within this area. We then apply different treatment strategies, namely surgery and adjuvant external beam radiotherapy and targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) and use the model to identify different sources of local recurrence and analyse their prevention. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

With quick development of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in recent years, this question is brought up that which method is more perfect to treat cancer. Methods: Radiation therapy is consisted of several methods including external radiation therapy (e.g. CyberKnife, IMRT, IGRT, SBRT, BNCT, Vero, IORT, Gamma knife, Tomotherapy and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)) and internal radiation therapy (e.g. brachytherapy, endoradiotherapy (target radionuclide therapy): radioimmunotherapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy) that any one has a special function in cancerous cells destroy. Results: Chemotherapy has still its place in cancer treatment and is used as a current and worldwide method. Nowadays, radiation therapy evolves with a surprising growth. By abandoning Cobalt-60, linear and circular accelerators which are able to accelerate particles, could be used for cancer treatment. CyberKnife, IMRT, IGRT, SBRT, VMAT, tomotherapy and Vero are the most advanced methods used to radiation therapy in all angles which had minimum mistake in radiation to the near intact tissues. Today, brachytherapy by increasing production of treatment radioisotopes by cyclotron and reactor is used in the world. Endoradiotherapy (Target radionuclide therapy): Radioimmunotherapy and peptidereceptor radionuclide therapy are two considerable methods in cancer treatment. Conclusion: In this review, we consider principals and application of radiation therapy in the early 21st century. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.",,0

Previous non-randomized studies have observed mammographic changes in the tumor bed to be more pronounced after IORT. The purpose of this study was to reassess the postoperative changes in a randomized single-center subgroup of patients from a multicenter trial (TARGIT-A). In this subgroup (n = 48) 27 patients received BCT with IORT, 21 patients had BCT with standard whole-breast radiotherapy serving as controls. Overall 258 postoperative mammograms (median follow-up 4.3 years, range 3-8) were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists in consensus focusing on changes in the tumor bed. Fat necroses showed to be significantly more frequent (56% versus 24%) and larger (8.7 versus 1.6 sq cm, median) after IORT than those in controls. Scar calcifications were also significantly more frequent after IORT (63% versus 19%). The high incidence of large fat necroses in our study confirms previous study findings. However, the overall higher incidence of calcifications in the tumor bed after IORT represents a new finding, requiring further attention. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,1

Beaulieu,2012.0,Dose to tissue medium or water cavities as surrogate for the dose to cell nuclei at brachytherapy photon energies,10.1088/0031-9155/57/14/4489,"It has been suggested that modern dose calculation algorithms should be able to report absorbed dose both as dose to the local medium, D(m,m,) and as dose to a water cavity embedded in the medium, D(w,m), using conversion factors from cavity theory. Assuming that the cell nucleus with its DNA content is the most important target for biological response, the aim of this study is to investigate, by means of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, the relationship of the dose to a cell nucleus in a medium, D(n,m,) to D(m,m) and D(w,m), for different combinations of cell nucleus compositions and tissue media for different photon energies used in brachytherapy. As D(n,m) is very impractical to calculate directly for routine treatment planning, while D(m,m) and D(w,m) are much easier to obtain, the questions arise which one of these quantities is the best surrogate for D(n,m) and which cavity theory assumptions should one use for its estimate. The Geant4.9.4 MC code was used to calculate D(m,m,) D(w,m) and D(n,m) for photon energies from 20 (representing the lower energy end of brachytherapy for (1)(0)(3)Pd or (1)(2)(5)I) to 300 keV (close to the mean energy of ((1)(9)(2)Ir) and for the tissue media adipose, breast, prostate and muscle. To simulate the cell and its nucleus, concentric spherical cavities were placed inside a cubic phantom (10 x 10 x 10 mm(3)). The diameter of the simulated nuclei was set to 14 microm. For each tissue medium, three different setups were simulated; (a) D(n,m) was calculated with nuclei embedded in tissues (MC-D(n,m)). Four different published elemental compositions of cell nuclei were used. (b) D(w,m) was calculated with MC (MC-D(w,m)) and compared with large cavity theory calculated D(w,m) (LCT-D(w,m)), and small cavity theory calculated D(w,m) (SCT-D(w,m)). (c) D(m,m) was calculated with MC (MC-D(m,m)). MC-D(w,m) is a good substitute for MC-D(n,m) for all photon energies and for all simulated nucleus compositions and tissue types. SCT-D(w,m) can be used for most energies in brachytherapy, while LCT-D(w,m) should only be considered for source spectra well below 50 keV, since contributions to the absorbed dose inside the nucleus to a large degree stem from electrons released in the surrounding medium. MC-D(m,m) is not an appropriate substitute for MC-D(n,m) for the lowest photon energies for adipose and breast tissues. The ratio of MC-D(m,m) to MC-D(n,m) for adipose and breast tissue deviates from unity by 34% and 15% respectively for the lowest photon energy (20 keV), whereas the ratio is close to unity for higher energies. For prostate and muscle tissue MC-D(m,m) is a good substitute for MC-D(n,m). However, for all photon energies and tissue types the nucleus composition with the highest hydrogen content behaves differently than other compositions. Elemental compositions of the tissue and nuclei affect considerably the absorbed dose to the cell nuclei for brachytherapy sources, in particular those at the low-energy end of the spectrum. Thus, there is a need for more accurate data for the elemental compositions of tumours and healthy cells. For the nucleus compositions and tissue types investigated, MC-D(w,m) is a good substitute to MC-D(n,m) for all simulated photon energies. Whether other studied surrogates are good approximations to MC-D(n,m) depends on the target size, target composition, composition of the surrounding tissue and photon energy.",eng,0

Materials/Methods: This was a single-institution, retrospective study that examined our first 322 cases treated with balloon-based APBI devices from November 2004 through December 2011. All patients received a total dose of 34.0 Gy in 10 fractions prescribed 1.0 cm from the balloon surface. Of the 322 cases, 306 (95.0%) were invasive breast cancer (IBC); 16 (5.0%) of the cases were non-invasive. We examined ASTRO consensus statement guidelines for APBI including age, BRCA 1/2 mutations, tumor size, T stage, margins, grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, multifocality, histology, pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), extensive intraductal component (EIC), and nodal status. In addition to variables specified in the ASTRO consensus statement, we analyzed progesterone receptor (PR) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) status, triple negative receptor status (TNRS), APBI balloon malfunction, type of catheter, number of days the catheter was in place, use of hormonal therapy, use of chemotherapy, and body mass index (BMI). No patients who had multicentric cancer or neoadjuvant therapy were treated with APBI. One case had a single microscopic axillary lymph node metastasis. Median follow-up was 45.1 months. Results: Twenty patients (6.21%) developed an IBTR for a 3-year actuarial IBTR rate of 2.87%. Among cases of IBTR, 3 had a nodal failure and 3 cases developed distant metastasis without nodal failure. There were 2 cases of nodal failure alone and 2 cases of distant metastasis alone. Negative PR status (p=0.033), TNRS (p < 0.001), and absence of hormonal therapy (p=0.036) correlated positively with higher rates of IBTR. Of the ASTRO consensus statement factors, cases with younger age (<60 vs > 60) (p=0.010) and negative ER status (p < 0.001) had significantly more cases of IBTR. When cases were scored as suitable (S) (n=133), cautionary (C) (n=166), and unsuitable (U) (n=23) based on all ASTRO consensus statement guidelines, there were no significant differences between groups in rates of IBTR (p=0.161). Conclusions: This community hospital's IBTR rate following APBI delivered via balloon brachytherapy is comparable to other long-term, single-institution studies. Of the factors outlined by the ASTRO consensus guidelines, only negative ER status and age <60 correlated with higher rates of IBTR. In addition, negative PR status, TNRS, and absence of hormonal therapy correlated with higher rates of IBTR.",,0

Douek,2015.0,Intraoperative radiotherapy in early breast cancer,10.1002/bjs.9781,"BACKGROUND: Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) constitutes a paradigm shift from the conventional 3-5 weeks of whole-breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). IORT enables delivery of radiation at the time of excision of the breast tumour, targeting the area at highest risk of recurrence, while minimizing excessive radiation exposure to healthy breast tissue. The rationale for IORT is based on the observation that over 90 per cent of local recurrences after breast-conserving surgery occur at or near the original operation site. METHODS: This article reviews trials of IORT delivered with different techniques and devices. RESULTS: IORT is a very attractive option for delivering radiotherapy, reducing the traditional fractionated treatment to a single fraction administered at the time of surgery. IORT has been shown to be associated with reduced toxicity and has several potential benefits over EBRT. Only two randomized clinical trials have been published to date. The TARGIT-A and ELIOT trials have demonstrated that IORT is associated with a low rate of local recurrence, although higher than that after EBRT (TARGIT-A: 3.3 versus 1.3 per cent respectively, P = 0.042; ELIOT: 4.4 versus 0.4 per cent, P < 0.001). However, the local recurrence rate for IORT fell within the predefined 2.5 per cent non-inferiority margin in TARGIT-A, and the 7.5 per cent equivalence margin in ELIOT. CONCLUSION: Longer follow-up data from existing trials, optimization of patient criteria and cost-effectiveness analyses are needed. Based on the current evidence, IORT can be offered as an alternative to EBRT to selected patients within agreed protocols, and outcomes should be monitored within national registries.",eng,0

Douek,2015.0,Is IORT ready for roll-out?,10.3332/ecancer.2015.516,"Two large randomised controlled trials of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in breast-conserving surgery (TARGIT-A and ELIOT) have been published 14 years after their launch. Neither the TARGIT-A trial nor the ELIOT trial results have changed the current clinical practice for the use of IORT. The in-breast local recurrence rate (LRR) after IORT met the pre-specified non-inferiority margins in both trials and was 3.3% in TARGIT-A and 4.4% in the ELIOT trial. In both trials, the pre-specified estimates for local recurrence (LR) with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) significantly overestimated actual LRR. In the TARGIT-A trial, LR with EBRT was estimated at the outset to be 6%, and in the ELIOT trial, it was estimated to be 3%. Surprisingly, LRR in the EBRT groups has been found to be significantly lower, 1.3% in the EBRT arm of the TARGIT-A and 0.4% in the EBRT arm of the ELIOT trial, respectively. Median follow-up was 2.4 years for the TARGIT-A trial and 5.8 years for the ELIOT trial. However, the initial cohort of patients in the TARGIT-A trial (reported in 2010) now have a median follow-up of 3.8 years and data on LR were available at 5 years follow-up on 35% of patients (18% who received IORT). Although further follow-up will increase confidence with the data, it will also further delay clinical implementation. By carefully weighing the risks and benefits of a single-fraction radiation treatment with patients, IORT should be offered within agreed and strict protocols. Patients deemed at low risk of LR or those deemed suitable for partial breast irradiation, according to the GEC-ESTRO and ASTRO recommendations, could be considered as candidates for IORT. These guidelines apply to all partial breast irradiation techniques, and more specific guidelines for IORT would assist clinicians.",eng,0

Higher rates of local recurrence occur in those elderly patients who avoid radiotherapy. TARGIT-A and ELIOT trials has been reported to not to be inferior to external beam RT in suitable subgroups of patients. The TARGIT-Elderly trial has been launched in order to confirm the efficacy of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in a well selected group of elderly patients who are more likely to decline radiation treatment. Objectives: Current evidence of the medical literature on the clinical reliability and applicability of intraoperative radiotherapy amongst older women diagnosed with early breast cancer is after summarized. Materials and methods: Literature databases were searched up to June 2015. Terms used to retrieve articles were 'breast cancer', 'elderly', 'intraoperative radiotherapy', 'IORT' and 'IOERT'. Results: Elderly patients with pT1N0 tumours are regarded to be suitable for IORT according to ASTRO and GEC-ESTRO recommendations, respectively. Discussion: In the light of the medical literature we can assume that patients benefit from postoperative radiation therapy, but we still do not know who can be spared from it. These issues emphasize the urgent need to develop and support clinical trials for this older population of breast cancer patients. Conclusions: Whether radiotherapy is beneficial in elderly still remains a matter of debate. IORT along with BCS in a selected subgroup of patients (>70years, pT1N0 tumours) could represent a valid option for a better local control. Copyright © 2016 IJS Publishing Group Ltd.",,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 43 of 83 patients treated with partial breast irradiation at our institution from June 1996 to October 2003 were retrospectively reviewed. The images of 27 patients who had received radiation by interstitial catheters and 16 who had received radiation by a single balloon were reviewed. Patients were examined for the presence of skin thickening, diffuse and focal increased density, mass, lucency, and calcifications. Fifteen initial sonograms were ordered to evaluate pain or focal findings on mammograms. In addition, two patients underwent one and one patient underwent three follow-up sonographic examinations. RESULTS: Mild to moderate skin thickening was present in 26 (60%) and no skin thickening in 17 (40%) of the 43 patients. Forty-one (95%) of the 43 patients had focal increased density. Diffuse increased density was seen in only one (2%) of the patients. There was no change in overall density in 2 (5%) of the patients. Fifteen (35%) of the 43 patients had mass or seroma at the first follow-up examination. Central lucency was present in 35 (81%) of 43 patients on at least one follow-up study. Calcification was present in 8 (19%) of 43 cases. CONCLUSION: Imaging findings after breast brachytherapy include the spectrum of findings seen with external beam radiation but are more focal. The focal findings may be alarming both clinically and radiographically, but biopsy can be avoided in most instances if information from the history is correlated with findings from continued follow-up of the patient's case.",eng,0

This practice potentially prevents many people from benefiting from more effective care. Provide a framework for analyzing clinical trial results to determine whether and when early adoption of novel interventions is appropriate. The framework includes the evaluation of three components: confidence in trial results, impact of early, and late adoption if trial results are reversed or sustained. The adverse impact of early adoption, and the opportunity cost of late adoption are determined using Markov modeling to simulate the impact of early and late adoption in terms of quality of life years and resources gained or lost. We applied the framework to the TARGIT-A randomized clinical trial comparing intraoperative radiation (IORT) to standard external beam radiation (EBRT) and considered these results in the context of trials comparing endocrine therapy with and without radiation therapy in postmenopausal women. Confidence in the TARGIT-A trial 4 year results is high because the peak hazard for local recurrence in the trial is between 2 and 3 years. This is consistent with most trials, and no second peak has been observed in similar patient populations, suggesting that the TARGIT-A trial results are stable. The interventions offer approximately equivalent life expectancy. If IORT local recurrences rate were as high as 10 % at 10 years (which is higher than expected), we would project only 0.002 fewer expected life years (less than 1 day) compared to EBRT if IORT is adopted early. However, there is a $1.7 billion opportunity cost of waiting an additional 5 years to adopt IORT in low risk, hormone-receptor-positive, postmenopausal women. EBRT costs an additional $1467 in indirect costs per patient. Applying an evaluative framework for the adoption of clinical trial results to the TARGIT-A IORT therapy trial results in the assessment that the trial results are stable, early adoption would lead to minimal adverse impact, and substantially less resource use. Both IORT and no radiation are reasonable strategies to adopt.",eng,0

Reasons for slow adoption include the disruption of practice routines, doubt about the validity of results, financial disincentive, and resistance to change. We propose a decision-making process to inform adoption that considers three factors: likelihood the trial's conclusions will not change with longer follow up, and consequences of early and late adoption. We apply this framework to the published 4-year results of the international TARGIT-A trial, which compares intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Methods: To find whether the trial results will remain robust, we reviewed the TARGIT-A trial's annual hazards for local recurrence (LR). We then reviewed 5-10 year LR rates from recent clinical trials with similar patient populations undergoing RT, no RT or partial breast RT. To assess the impact of an early change in practice, a Markov model was used to evaluate life expectancy, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost. Sensitivity analysis estimated the impact of varying the LR rate 1-20x the TARGIT-A 4 year results. To estimate the impact of late adoption, we generated the expected number of N0, grades 1 & 2, ductal cancers in postmenopausal women (>50 yrs) from SEER and US Census Bureau data. Using Medicare rates, costs of EBRT vs. IORT were compared and potential savings to the health care system calculated. Results: The TARGIT-A peak hazard for LR for IORT and EBRT occurred at 3 years. In the START and ATAC trials, the peak local recurrence Kaplan Meier estimates are between 2 and 3 years. In other trials (ATAC, and in the 2005 RT Lancet overview) there is no second peak of recurrence, making it unlikely that longer follow up will change the conclusion of the TARGIT-A results. The LRR in similar trials have dropped steadily over time for post menopausal, stage I patients with or without RT. Impact of early adoption: If treatment were adopted early, the impact on life expectancy and QALYs would be minimal unless IORT LR rate exceeds 20% over a 10 year period of time. Impact of late adoption: In the US, 45% of new breast cancer cases fit the described population. EBRT costs $6,400 more than IORT per patient on average. If adoption were delayed 5 years to allow the trial results to mature, 70,136 patients per year are expected to receive EBRT resulting in a societal burden of >$2.2 billion barring the capital investment required for new technology. This also assumes that patients have equal utility for a single dose of IORT as they do for 3-6 weeks of postoperative radiation therapy. If IORT utility is higher than that of EBRT, then the IORT strategy is both more effective and less costly. Conclusion: The process of modeling the impact of both early and late adoption when considering the stability of trial results can serve as a tool to evaluate whether to change practice. This analysis was tested on the results of the TARGIT-A trial, and demonstrated that prompt adoption of the IORT intervention would cause minimal harm, provide an improved quality of life, and offer significant societal savings.",,0

This report presents the use of serial computed tomography (CT) imaging, in addition to planar or ultrasound imaging, for the quality assurance of an APBI treatment using the elliptical MammoSite. METHODS AND MATERIALS: CT images of a patient implanted with a 4cmx6cm elliptical MammoSite balloon were acquired. A treatment plan using multiple, nonequally weighted dwells was generated and delivered on Day 1 of a 10-fraction, twice-daily treatment. Before morning treatments on Days 2-5, the patient was reimaged on CT. Treatment plans on repeat CTs were generated two ways: using the decay-corrected plan from Day 1 (unadapted) vs. modifying the plan to account for changes in implant geometry (adapted). Adapted and unadapted plans on repeat CTs were compared with one another, and to the Day 1 plan. RESULTS: The use of unadapted plans led to increased doses to normal tissues, particularly the skin. Adaptive planning on the repeat CTs was effective for maintaining acceptable dosimetry throughout treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Serial CT imaging was shown to provide a useful tool for the quality assurance of an elliptical balloon implant during the course of treatment. Serial CT imaging, as opposed to planar or ultrasound imaging, was necessary to evaluate skin dose and to facilitate adaptation of the treatment plan to satisfy limits for skin dose.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study evaluated 38 patients who had undergone intraoperative MammoSite catheter placement at lumpectomy or reexcision followed by accelerated partial breast irradiation with 34 Gy in 10 fractions. Data were collected regarding dosimetric parameters, including the volume of tissue enclosed by the 100%, 150%, and 200% isodose shells, dose homogeneity index, and maximal dose at the surface of the applicator. Clinical and treatment-related factors were analyzed, including patient age, patient weight, history of diabetes and smoking, use of reexcision, interval between surgery and radiotherapy, total duration of catheter placement, total excised specimen volume, and presence or absence of postprocedural infection. Seroma was verified by clinical examination, mammography, and/or ultrasonography. Persistent seroma was defined as seroma that was clinically detectable >6 months after radiotherapy completion. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 17 months, the overall rate of any detectable seroma was 76.3%. Persistent seroma (>6 months) occurred in 26 (68.4%) of 38 patients, of whom 46% experienced at least modest discomfort at some point during follow-up. Of these symptomatic patients, 3 required biopsy or complete cavity excision, revealing squamous metaplasia, foreign body giant cell reaction, fibroblasts, and active collagen deposition. Of the analyzed dosimetric, clinical, and treatment-related variables, only body weight correlated positively with the risk of seroma formation (p = 0.04). Postprocedural infection correlated significantly (p = 0.05) with a reduced risk of seroma formation. Seroma was associated with a suboptimal cosmetic outcome, because excellent scores were achieved in 61.5% of women with seroma compared with 83% without seroma. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative placement of the MammoSite catheter for accelerated partial breast irradiation is associated with a high rate of clinically detectable seroma that adversely affects the cosmetic outcome. The seroma risk was positively associated with body weight and negatively associated with postprocedural infection.",eng,0

A standard line source plan is presented to be used in a single catheter or as a starting point for forward planned ML. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study population consists of 12 patients previously treated with a single lumen. Inverse plans were created for 7 patients and used to create a standard line source plan. ML plans were created on the same patient data sets. The dosimetric aims were as follows: PTV_EVAL (planning target volume for evaluation) D95 (dose received [%] by 95% of PTV_EVAL volume)>/=95% of the prescribed dose (PD), the maximum skin and rib dose </=125% of prescription dose, breast V150 (volume [cc] receiving 150% of the PD)</=50cc, and V200 (volume [cc] receiving 200% of the PD)</=10cc. RESULTS: The number of patients fulfilling all dosimetric constraints went from 1 patient of 12 with a single catheter to 6 patients of 12 with inverse planned ML and 7 patients of 12 with forward planned ML. PTV_EVAL D95 increased significantly with the standard line source plans and ML plans when compared with the single-source plans. Forward planning took, on average, 7min longer than inverse planning. CONCLUSION: Multiple sources in a single catheter improve coverage at catheter ends, whereas ML can further improve coverage and reduce dose to organs at risk. Using a standard line source as a starting point for forward planning ML means increase in planning time is kept to a minimum, making it a practicable option for centers without inverse planning software. Patients previously ineligible for treatment with a single catheter may be treated using ML.",eng,0

Two patients required percutaneous nephrostomy tubes, and five required open operations. Good to excellent palliation was achieved in 23 of 24 patients. Mean survival in the group with diffuse metastases was 13 months (range, six to 29 months). Nine patients with localized recurrences underwent surgical procedures. For localized pelvic recurrences, total exenteration (with or without intraoperative radiotherapy) provided excellent palliation with low morbidity. At the time of this report, five of six such patients had no evidence of disease, and one had a small asymptomatic pelvic recurrence, with a mean follow-up of 13 months (range, five to 19 months).",eng,0

Radiotherapy (RT) after lumpectomy significantly reduces the risk of recurrence. We investigated the direct effects of surgery and of RT delivered intraoperatively (IORT), by collecting irradiated and non-irradiated breast tissues from BC patients, after tumor removal. These breast tissue specimens have been profiled for their microRNA (miR) expression, in search of differentially expressed miR among patients treated or not with IORT. Our results demonstrate that IORT elicits effects that go beyond the direct killing of residual tumor cells. IORT altered the wound response, inducing the expression of miR-223 in the peri-tumoral breast tissue. miR-223 downregulated the local expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), leading to decreased activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) on target cells and, eventually, dampening a positive EGF-EGFR autocrine/paracrine stimulation loop induced by the post-surgical wound-healing response. Accordingly, both RT-induced miR-223 and peri-operative inhibition of EGFR efficiently prevented BC cell growth and reduced recurrence formation in mouse models of BC. Our study uncovers unknown effects of RT delivered on a wounded tissue and prompts to the use of anti-EGFR treatments, in a peri-operative treatment schedule, aimed to timely treat BC patients and restrain recurrence formation.Oncogene advance online publication, 15 February 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.23.

This observation suggested that surgery itself could represent a perturbing factor, possibly by altering the local microenvironment by inducing a wound healing response. Recent evidences indicate that, in selected EBC patients, 5 weeks of EBRT can be successfully replaced by a single dose of Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy (TARGIT). Interestingly, TARGIT acts not only affecting tumor cell survival itself, but is also able to alter the tumor microenvironment, by modifying cytokines secretion and activation of several intracellular pathways in breast cancer cells. In order to understand the significance of these modifications in breast tumor microenvironment after exposure to TARGIT we set up a mouse model of TARGIT treatment. Our results highlighted that the act of surgery alone strongly stimulates breast cancer cell growth and the addition of local irradiation completely reverses the surgery-induced breast cancer cell growth. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of TARGIT by analyzing microRNA (miR) expression both in our mouse model and in human specimens. To this aim, we collected paired specimens of peri-tumoral mammary tissues from 30 early breast cancer (EBC) patients, before and after treatment with TARGIT. Microarray approach followed by qRT-PCR validation revealed the presence of specific TARGIT-regulated miRs. Among the others, miR-223 was the most highly and significantly modified. In silico analyses indicated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potential candidate of mR-223 regulation. In vitro experiments, using both normal and tumor derived cell lines validated the bioinformatic prediction, demonstrating that the 3' UTR of EGF is a target of miR-223 and this binding results in the control of EGF production by the cells. Importantly, miR-223 overexpression was able to impair, at least in part, the wound-induced growth of normal and tumor derived breast-cancer cells, eventually influencing breast cancer cell proliferation and survival. Our results suggest that the effects of radiotherapy in the wounded tissue go far beyond the mere killing of residual tumor cells and is able to balance the negative effects of the wound healing process, both in human and mouse breast tissue. TARGIT-induced microenvironment modifications, in particular miR-223 up-regulation, significantly impair breast cancer response to surgery-induced inflammation eventually resulting in recurrence control. Our experimental findings strongly support the notion that the timely application of radiotherapy to the tumor bed, immediately after tumor removal, is critical to counteract the effects of surgery and wound healing process on residual breast cancer cells and normal peri-tumoral breast tissue.",,0

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) allows a shortened overall treatment time for early breast cancer either combined with whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT), or alone. Although the early side effects of IORT are well known, data on clinically important late side effects, which require medical intervention, are scarce. Aim: In this study, we analyze risk factors for seroma evacuation more than 6 months after IORT. Materials and methods: We evaluated 120 patients with a mean follow-up of 27.8 months (range: 7-52 months). Fifty-one patients received IORT only and 69 were additionally treated with WBRT. Results: Seroma evacuation was performed 6-38 months after IORT. Two (3.9%) events were observed in the IORT group and 14 (20%) in the IORT + WBRT group. Univariate (Kaplan-Meier) analysis showed that addition of WBRT to IORT increased the risk of seroma evacuation [hazard ratio = 5.5, 95% confidence interval: 2.0-14.7, P = 0.011]. In a multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards regression), WBRT and axillary lymph node dissection were significant risk factors for seroma evacuation (model P value = 0.0025). Conclusions: WBRT applied after IORT is associated with increased risk of seroma evacuation, which might be considered as a late side effect. Copyright © 2016 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.",,1

This article describes not only the more widespread theoretical concepts on DIN but also the differences in the practical applications of the theory between different countries, different oncology specialists, and different cancer centers. Papers related to the international multicentric-randomized trials and retrospective studies were analyzed. We include articles and papers published between 1993 and 2010 related to patients with DIN, and abstracts and reports from MEDLINE and other sources were indentified. The standard of care for DIN consists of (a) breast conservative surgery (mastectomy is still indicated in large lesions-masses or microcalcifications-in about 30% of cases); (b) radiotherapy (RT) after conservative surgery, and (c) medical treatment in estrogen receptors-positive patients. However, most studies have shown significant differences between theory and practical application. Moreover, there are differences regarding (a) the indications of sentinel lymph node biopsy, (b) the definition and identification of low-risk DIN subgroups that can avoid RT and tamoxifen, and (c) the research into new alternative drugs in adjuvant medical therapy. A general agreement on the best management of DIN does not exist as yet. New large trials are needed in order to define the best management of DIN patients which is (in most respects) still complex and controversial. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,0

Koves,1997.0,[Experience in the treatment of breast sarcomas],", ","Authors operated on 6339 malignant breast tumors at the Department of Surgery, National Institute on Oncology between 1980 and 1994. The records of 14 patients with sarcomas of the breast were analyzed. These included 2 malignant phyllodes tumors, 3 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 2-2 fibrosarcomas and carcinosarcomas and liposarcoma, angiosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans one of each. During this period 5 patients died, 9 are living without evidence of tumor. Analysing these 14 cases authors present their policy in surgical therapy of breast sarcomas compared with literature data. They emphasise the importance of wide resection margins for prevention of tumor progression. The above mentioned principle is valid for local recurrences so radicalization of the previous conservative breast surgery may be necessary in selected cases. Intraoperative histological examination is recommended to verify that the resection margins are tumor free. Axillary block dissection is not necessary except in cases when palpable, firm lymph nodes are present in the region. Depending on the histological grade adjuvant radiotherapy could be considered but its effectiveness is not proven.",hun,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred and twenty-five patients who underwent lymphatic mapping for early breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation (80%) or mastectomy (20%) were evaluated. There were two phases in the study: the validation phase (105 patients, 52 T1, 53 T2 < or = 4 cm), and the application phase (120 patients, 70 T1, 50 T2 < or = 2.5 cm). In the validation, if a drainage pathway to the IMN was identified, no biopsy was performed in this phase. In the application, if the study showed metastases in the IMNs, biopsy was performed. When histologically proven IMN metastases were detected, RT was included on the IMN chain planned with a 3D treatment system using conformal techniques. At the beginning of the study the injection site was subdermal and subsequently, the injection site was changed to peritumoral and intratumoral to search for IMN. RESULTS: In 31 patients of 225 (14%) hot spots were observed in the internal mammary chain (11.5% and 17.2% in the validation and application phases, respectively). In the validation phase, in 11 cases (11.5%) IMN drainage was observed, and in the application phase, in 20 cases (17.2%). Sampling of the internal mammary basin based on lymphoscintigraphy results was successful in 69% of the cases (14 of 20) and revealed metastatic involvement in 14% (2 of 14). This represents incidence of only 1.7% (2 of 116) in early breast cancer patients with SLN study in the application phase. In both cases the axillary SLN was also positive. Both patients with metastatic involvement of the IMN area received RT on the IMN chain next to the remaining breast after conservative surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that 14% of the patients with intraoperative drainage into the IMN surgical examination of the lymph nodes had pathologically positive metastases. The percentage in pathologically proven metastatic involvement of IMN after the SLN technique in early breast cancer is low, but it is not negligible. Moreover, it is expected to increase since the international recommendations have established a 3-cm cutoff for practicing the SLN technique. Although the real value of IMN irradiation in early breast cancer is not known, including this chain in postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended unless pathologically proven IMNs have been produced by the SLN technique. To avoid overdosage or underdosage in the joint between the medial tangential and IMN fields, an individualized 3D dosimetry study is mandatory to enhance dose distribution and reduce the heart volume to lessen side effects.",eng,0

We report our institutional experience with SF IORT in early stage breast cancer with respect to local control and toxicity. Materials/Methods: Records were reviewed for 64 consecutive pts who received SF IORT from 2002 to 2014 at our institution. Of these, 47 pts were prospectively enrolled in an institutional IRB-approved phase 1-2 study between 2002 and 2008. Eligible pts were >40 years with stage 0, I or II breast cancer measuring > 2.5 cm without nodal involvement and were all screened with breast MRI to exclude multifocal or multicentric disease. Eight of the 47 pts did not fully meet eligibility criteria and declined additional surgery or radiation. The remaining 17 pts were treated per protocol guidelines between 2009 and 2014. IORT was delivered using either a 200 kV orthovoltage source or electrons to 15-21 Gy prescribed to the 90% isodose line. Results: The median age at treatment was 61 years (range: 40-84 years). Median f/u time was 81 months (range 1 - 136 months). Two pts had an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), one of whom was treated off protocol. A third patient had a nodal micrometastasis and developed an isolated axillary recurrence. All 3 patients had declined further surgery, radiation, and/or systemic therapy. Overall, 52 of 64 pts (81%) received adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of endocrine therapy (n = 49), chemotherapy (n = 5) and/or trastuzumab (n = 1). For pts who met original protocol guidelines, the IBTR rate was 1.6% at 6 years of f/u. On univariate analysis, the following factors emerged as significant predictors of IBTR: age <50 years (p < 0.001), pathologic nodal involvement (p < 0.001), and lack of any adjuvant systemic therapy (p=0.001). There were 2 cases of isolated distant relapses, which occurred in pts who had also declined adjuvant systemic therapy. Lack of systemic therapy was the only significant predictor of distant relapse (p = 0.01). All 64 pts tolerated IORT well with no evidence of grade III or higher toxicity. Conclusions: APBI using IORT is an inherently desirable option for breast conserving therapy. Our group has an IBTR rate of 1.6% at 6 years of f/u. Lack of systemic therapy emerged as a significant predictor for local, regional, and distant relapse. We conclude that adherence to appropriate clinical guidelines for patient selection and strongly advising adherence to recommendations for additional surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy are critical for successful use of APBI using SF IORT.",,0

Patients were comparable with regard to age, menopausal status, tumor size, histological type, grading and axillary lymph node status. Included were patients with invasive breast cancer pT1 and pT2, N0, N1, N2, M0 and breast conserving surgery with clear margins > 3mm. Excluded were patients with DCIS only, patients with invasive breast cancers larger than pT2, patients after primary systemic therapy and patients with multicentric disease. All patients (group 1 and group 2) received postoperative whole breast irradiation of 51 - 56,1 Gy. Group 1 received postoperative electron boost irradiation of 12 Gy after whole breast irradiation and group 2 received one intraoperative electron boost of 9 Gy in a single fraction during surgery before whole breast irradiation. Results: The 10 - years actuarial rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), true local recurrence (TLR), distant recurrence (DR) and disease free survival (DFS) were 7.1% (95%CI, 3.2-11.0%), 4.8% (95%CI, 1.5- 8.0%), 14.2% (95%CI, 9.1-19,4%) and 82.4% respectively in group 1 and 2.7% (95%CI, 0.0-5.9%, P=0,062), 0.7% (95%CI, 0.0-2.0%, P=0.016), 13.6% (95%CI, 5.0-22,2%, P=0.90) and 84.0% (P=0.76) respectively in group 2. Conclusions: Patients treated with IOERT boost and whole breast irradiation achieve excellent local control rates at 10 years and exhibit statistically significant decreased true local recurrence rates compared to patients treated with whole breast irradiation and conventional electron boost.",,0

Aim of this study was to evaluate the IBTR rate in patients who were treated with preoperative chemotherapy followed by breast conserving surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (IOERT). Materials: 84 patients with clinical stage II or III breast cancer were included in the study. Patients received 3 to 6 cycles of anthracyclin/taxane containing preoperative chemotherapy. All patients had breast conserving surgery with sentinel node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection and received intraoperative radiotherapy with 9 Gy to the 90% reference isodose as an anticipated boost radiation. Whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) was preformed after surgery for all patients. Results: Pathologic complete response was achieved in 18/84 (21%) patients. Mean resection volume was 250 ml. After a median follow-up of 30.5 months (range 6-77 months) no IBTR could be observed. One patient developed a locoregional recurrence an the axilla and nine patients developed distant disease, five of those died of disease. Three patients developed contralateral breast cancer. 71 patients are alive wthout evidence of disease. Conclusions: Breast conserving surgery with IOERT in boost modality after preoperative chemotherapy is a reliable tool for prevention of IBTR. The period between IOERT and WBRT is short as no adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary. Cosmetic outcome is excellent.",,0

A collaborative analysis has been performed by European ISIORT member institutions for long term evaluation of this strategy. Material and methods Until 10/2005, 1109 unselected patients of any risk group have been identified among seven centers using identical methods, sequencing and dosage for intra- and postoperative radiotherapy. A median IOERT dose of 10 Gy was applied (90% reference isodose), preceding WBI with 50-54 Gy (single doses 1.7-2 Gy). Results At a median follow up of 72.4 months (0.8-239), only 16 in-breast recurrences were observed, yielding a local tumor control rate of 99.2%. Relapses occurred 12.5-151 months after primary treatment. In multivariate analysis only grade 3 reached significance (p = 0.031) to be predictive for local recurrence development. Taking into account patient age, annual in-breast recurrence rates amounted 0.64%, 0.34%, 0.21% and 0.16% in patients <40 years; 40-49 years; 50-59 years and >60 years, respectively. Conclusion In all risk subgroups, a 10 Gy IOERT boost prior to WBI provided outstanding local control rates, comparing favourably to all trials with similar length of follow up. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A secondary aim was to examine factors associated with postoperative pain. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of 196 female breast surgery subjects was conducted. Data were collected on: numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and at 1 month and 6-12 months postoperative; age; race; insurance; obesity; radiotherapy; chemotherapy; hypertension; anesthesia care time; and intraoperative and PACU opioid use. Severe postoperative pain was defined as NAS > or = 5. Data were analyzed using chi square, Fisher's exact test or analysis of variance, with alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: PACU pain and the incidence of severe PACU pain increased with surgical complexity (P < 0.005). PACU pain scores averaged 4.71 +/- 0.24 and 57.7% of subjects experienced severe pain. Postoperative pain scores at 1 or 6-12 months did not vary by surgical complexity and averaged 2.21 +/- 0.32 and 0.74 +/- 0.22, respectively. Severe postoperative pain was experienced by 22.1% of subjects at 1 month and 8.2% of subjects at 6-12 months. Older age and systolic hypertension were associated with less PACU pain. Non-White race, obesity, and high PACU opioid use were associated with greater postoperative pain at 1 month. Non-White people also had greater postoperative pain at 6-12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that nearly 60% of breast surgery patients experience severe acute postoperative pain, with severe pain persisting for 6-12 months in almost 10% of patients.",eng,0

Methods: From July 2008 to December 2012, 36 early breast cancer patients underwent breast-conserving surgery plus interoperative radiotherapy on a Mobetron 1000 mobile electron accelerator. Postoperative recurrence and metastases, complications and cosmetic outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Results: During a median follow-up period of 27.9 months, 2 patients(5.56%) underwent mastectomy after local relapses. There was no occurrence of distant metastasis or mortality. Their average wound healing time was 17 days and 2 of them (5.56%) developed infection while another 2 (5.56%) had delayed wound healing. And 1 patient (2.78%) showed wound edema and neither lyponecrosis nor hematoma was found. The evaluation of cosmetic outcome shows 32 patients(88.89% )were graded as excellent or good while another 4(11.11%) fair or poor. None had radiotherapy-related acute hemotological toxicity and 2 patients (5.56%) developed skin pigmentation.

It is a radionuclide approach with (90)Y-biotin combined with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to release a boost of radiation in the tumour bed. Two previous clinical trials using dosimetry based on the calculation of mean absorbed dose values with the hypothesis of uniform activity distribution (MIRD 16 method) assessed the feasibility and safety of IART. In the present retrospective study, a voxel dosimetry analysis was performed to investigate heterogeneity in distribution of the absorbed dose. The aim of this work was to compare dosimetric and radiobiological evaluations derived from average absorbed dose vs. voxel absorbed dose approaches. METHODS: We evaluated 14 patients who were injected with avidin into the tumour bed after conservative surgery and 1 day later received an intravenous injection of 3.7 GBq of (90)Y-biotin (together with 185 MBq (111)In-biotin for imaging). Sequential images were used to estimate the absorbed dose in the target region according to the standard dosimetry method (SDM) and the voxel dosimetry method (VDM). The biologically effective dose (BED) distribution was also evaluated. Dose/volume and BED volume histograms were generated to derive equivalent uniform BED (EUBED) and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values. RESULTS: No cold spots"" were highlighted by voxel dosimetry. The median absorbed-dose in the target region was 20 Gy (range 15-27 Gy) by SDM, and the median EUD was 20.4 Gy (range 16.5-29.4 Gy) by the VDM; SDM and VDM estimates differed by about 6 %. The EUD/mean voxel absorbed dose ratio was >0.9 in all patients, indicative of acceptable uniformity in the target. The median BED and EUBED values were 21.8 Gy (range 15.9-29.3 Gy) and 22.8 Gy (range 17.3-31.8 Gy), respectively. CONCLUSION: VDM highlighted the absence of significant heterogeneity in absorbed dose in the target. The EUD/mean absorbed dose ratio indicated a biological efficacy comparable to that of uniform distribution of absorbed dose. The VDM is recommended for improving accuracy, taking into account actual activity distribution in the target region.

In recent years, there has been a shift in clinical investigational focus toward refinements in the methods of delivering adjuvant radiotherapy that provide shorter, more convenient schedules of external-beam radiotherapy and interstitial treatment. Expedited courses of wholebreast treatment have been demonstrated to be equivalent to traditional lengthier courses in terms of tumor control and cosmetic outcome and to provide an opportunity for cost efficiencies.

Kim,2011.0,Compensator-based intensity modulated brachytherapy,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed13&AN=70481463","Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of compensator-based intensity modulated brachytherapy (CIMBT), which delivers conformal dose distributions to non-radially symmetric targets such as MRI-delineated cervical cancer tumors or non-spherical breast lumpectomy cavities with an electronic brachytherapy (eBT) source. With CIMBT the eBT catheter is wrapped with a patient-specific compensator with spatially-varying thicknesses of an attenuator such as tungsten or lead, enabling IMBT delivery with no additional moving parts. eBT x-rays are sufficiently low-energy (<50 keV) that compensators can be thin enough (<100 microns) to fit between the catheter and applicator. Materials: A 3-D CIMBT treatment planning system prototype was implemented with the MATLAB software, which simultaneously optimizes the compensator thickness distribution and the source dwell times at multiple positions. The dose calculation currently ignores scatter and uses a 50 keV Xoft AxxentTM eBT spectrum. Oblique incidence of x-rays on the compensator is accounted for. Conventional eBT and CIMBT treatment plans were generated for an ellipsoidal tumor with a length of 10 cm, a width of 6 cm, and a height of 4 cm. The compensator ran the full length of the tumor, and twenty-one uniformly-spaced dwell positions were used. Results: The cutaway in the Figure shows that the dose homogeneity on the target surface for (a) conventional eBT is inferior to that of (b) CIMBT. CIMBT reduced the difference between the minimum doses received by the hottest 10% and 90% of the tumor surface from 60% to 25% of the surface prescription dose, improving tumor coverage and reducing dose outside the tumor volume. The total mAs required to deliver CIMBT was twice that of conventional eBT. No benefit was found in CIMBT plan quality for lead compensator thicknesses of above 100 microns, thus a 100 micron compensator thickness constraint could be applied to the compensator optimization and manufacturing process. Plan quality converged with 11.25 azimuthal and 2 mm longitudinal compensator segment increments. Compensators can be rapidly generated from laser- or chemical-etched plastic substrate that is filled with lead or tungsten powder and laminated, or using printed circuit board technology. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the promise of CIMBT using simple dose calculation, optimization, and tumor models. Future studies considering more complicated tumor volumes are underway, and hardware for a CIMBT prototype is currently under development. (Figure presented).",,0

To do so, model based dose calculation algorithms require accurate modelling of the applicator geometry. This can be non-trivial in the case of irregularly shaped applicators such as the Fletcher Williamson gynaecological applicator or balloon applicators with possibly irregular shapes employed in accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) performed using electronic brachytherapy sources (EBS). While many of these applicators can be modelled using constructive solid geometry (CSG), the latter may be difficult and time-consuming. Alternatively, these complex geometries can be modelled using tessellated geometries such as tetrahedral meshes (mesh geometries (MG)). Recent versions of Monte Carlo (MC) codes Geant4 and MCNP6 allow for the use of MG. The goal of this work was to model a series of applicators relevant to brachytherapy using MG. Applicators designed for (192)Ir sources and 50kV EBS were studied; a shielded vaginal applicator, a shielded Fletcher Williamson applicator and an APBI balloon applicator. All applicators were modelled in Geant4 and MCNP6 using MG and CSG for dose calculations. CSG derived dose distributions were considered as reference and used to validate MG models by comparing dose distribution ratios. In general agreement within 1% for the dose calculations was observed for all applicators between MG and CSG and between codes when considering volumes inside the 25% isodose surface. When compared to CSG, MG required longer computation times by a factor of at least 2 for MC simulations using the same code. MCNP6 calculation times were more than ten times shorter than Geant4 in some cases. In conclusion we presented methods allowing for high fidelity modelling with results equivalent to CSG. To the best of our knowledge MG offers the most accurate representation of an irregular APBI balloon applicator.",,0

A single 10-Gy fraction boost was given to the tumor bed after resection followed by whole-breast radiotherapy. After IOERT, three patients required completion axillary lymph node dissection, eight had reexcision resulting from positive margins, and four opted for completion mastectomy. The median follow-up was 10 months (range, 2 to 24 months). Ten patients had Grade 1 and one reported Grade 2 breast pain 2 weeks after IOERT; all resolved at 6 weeks. Two patients had delay in wound healing, but none developed a wound infection. Three patients reported symptomatic fat necrosis. No other toxicities were reported. IOERT resulted in a reduction in treatment time, was not associated with additional toxicity or change in the acute toxicity profile, and is a feasible treatment option in a community hospital setting.",,0

Filippo Neri Hospital in Rome from June 1998 to June 2001 is reported. The aim of this work is to present the facilities encountered in the use of a movable linear accelerator dedicated to the operating room (NOVAC 7, Hitesys SPA) for the organization and clinical activity of intraoperative radiotherapy technique. One hundred and twenty-two patients were treated with IORT technique using Novac7. Thirty-seven of them had rectum cancer, 9 pancreas, 4 gastric cancers, 66 breast cancer and 6 different cancers (one colon, one pelvic sarcoma, one retroperitoneal sarcoma, two adrenal glands and one gallbladder). A pilot randomized study on IORT for stage 1-II breast cancer is going on: it consists of conservative surgery with or withouth 10 Gy IORT boost followed by external radiotherapy standard dose (50.4 Gy) plus a 10 Gy electron boost in patients who didn't receive IORT technique. Procedures and times, technical aspects, clinical set-up and feasibility of the treatment are compared to the classic ones with patient transportation. A minimal time is spent for IORT treatment (the technique adds 10 to 15 minutes to the total anesthesia time and surgical procedures) and it makes IORT technique easier and feasible in different cancers. No major complications were seen: 3 patients presented probable acute toxicity (all of them were breast patients) with surgical scar infection or seroma (no more percentage than controls), 3 patients had doubt toxicity (one bowel anastomotic stenosis, one uretheral obstruction and one liver abscess), and 4 patients probable late toxicity at more than three months from surgery (two of them had a significative delay in scar normalization, one presented ischialgia-paraesthesia and one persistent lymphocoele). At the moment 7 patients dead (one of them for heart attack, one for pulmonary emboli and one for deep venous thrombosis, none of them directly caused by IORT procedure) and 9 patients are alive with disease, four of which with local relapse. We can conclude that the use of Novac7 decreases significantly the total anesthesia time, doesn't imply additional risks of infection, makes positioning of the machine and the technique easier and safer and, as the procedure is related only to the times of surgery, it allows the treatment of a considerable number of patients and neoplasms, with possible reduction in total external radiotherapy dose. As for the technique with patient transportation the clinical role of radiotherapist is prioritary for the indication to the treatments decision making and patient set up. For this reason the use of clinical protocols and standard procedures in the cooperation with surgeons is requested.",,0

Materials and Methods: 99 NSM were performed in 91 patients (eight cases bilateral) from 2003 to 2011, and were retrospectively analyzed. 81/99 cases were performed since 2009. All patients necessitating mastectomy without clinical evidence of nipple-areola complex (NAC) invasion or retraction, and with a minimal 1 cm clinical and radiological distance of the tumor from the NAC were considered eligible. The NAC was radically dissected, and an intra-operative serial histologic exam of the retro-areolar tissue was performed. No intraoperative radiotherapy was considered. Results: Median age was 46 years (29-64) and median tumor diameter 1.9 cm (0.5-7). NSM was performed for multifocality (n = 57), locally advanced disease (n = 31), bilateral cancer (n= 3), prophylactic controlateral surgery (n = 2), or strong familiar history of breast cancer (n = 6). Histology was invasive ductal (n = 63) or lobular (n= 15), in situ (n = 7), phyllloides (n = 5). A positive N status was present in 34/91 cancer cases (37%). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 21/78 invasive cancer patients (27%), while additional 43 patients received adjuvant systemic treatment/ (55%), and 10 patients post-operative chestwall radiotherapy (13%). NAC was removed for neoplasia after intra-op or post-op histologic exam of the retro-areolar tissue in 14 and in 3 cases, respectively (17%). Only 5/17 of these removed NAC showed histologic evidence of neoplasia (29%), while there was one falsepositive of intra-operative exam. Total NAC necrosis occurred in 4 cases (4%), while 10 additional patients (10%) showed minimal necrosis or superficial desquamation, without permanent aesthetic consequences. Breast reconstruction was performed with immediate prostheses (n = 61) or with expander-prostheses (n= 38). Patients judged their aesthetic result (intention to treat analysis) as excellent (n = 28), good (n = 51), sufficient/fair (n = 16) or insufficient (n = 4). At a median follow-up of 23 months there were no loco-regional recurrences, while four patients developed systemic relapse. Conclusions: With a limited follow-up, NSM appears to be safe when performed by a dedicated team. It can offer improved esthetic results, even in heavily treated or advanced tumors, if there is no evidence of cancer in the retroareolar tissue. Eligible patients can retain their NAC in about 80% of cases even if non-restrictive indications are implemented..",,0

The purpose of this study was to determine whether prereconstruction radiation therapy affects the rate of vascular complications in free flap breast reconstruction. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of free flap breast reconstruction performed between 2005 and 2009 by the senior authors. In addition to medical and surgical history, vascular complications were recorded, including intraoperative and postoperative thromboses and technical difficulties resulting in a variation of the standard approach. RESULTS: In total, 226 flaps were placed into an irradiated field, whereas 799 were transposed into a radiation-naive defect. Vascular complications as a whole were more prevalent in the irradiated group (9.6 percent versus 17.3 percent; p = 0.001). In regression modeling, radiation therapy was identified as an independent risk factor (odds ratio, 1.68; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 2.70). In subanalysis, there is a significantly higher rate of intraoperative vascular complications (7.6 percent versus 14.2 percent; p = 0.003), although individual outcomes did not reach formal significance. Previous irradiation had no effect on delayed vascular complications, flap loss, fat necrosis, infection, skin flap necrosis, hematoma, seroma, or delayed wound healing. CONCLUSIONS: Prereconstruction radiation therapy increases the rate of vascular complications in free flap breast reconstruction, the majority of which appear intraoperatively. Although radiation does not hinder the overall success of reconstruction or contribute to postoperative complications, surgeons should be aware that working in a previously irradiated field carries additional technical risk.",eng,0

The goal is to select patients with the lowest risk for tumor spread outside of the original lumpectomy bed targeted by the local internal radiation dose. Therefore, patients with more aggressive types of breast cancer might not be ideal candidates for partial breast irradiation. We discuss the case of a 67-year-old woman who presented with local recurrence of invasive micropapillary breast cancer, a rare aggressive tumor type, 5 years after MammoSite brachytherapy. The patient's primary tumor possessed all favorable indicators except for the histology of invasive micropapillary carcinoma. This is the first report of invasive micropapillary carcinoma recurring after APBI. Although this is a single case, it supports the hypothesis that more aggressive types of breast cancer have a higher risk of local recurrence after APBI. We propose that invasive micropapillary carcinoma be considered a potential exclusion criterion until it can be validated in prospective clinical trials. More aggressive treatment approaches including whole-breast irradiation and/or chemotherapy might be needed to reduce the risk of local recurrence for invasive micropapillary breast cancer.",,0

Materials and Methods: from September 2009 to September 2011 a group of 199 patients candidates for IORT was included in a pilot study conducted at our center to assess tolerance and efficacy to different doses in exclusive IORT in breast cancer conservative treatment, after the approval of the ethics committee. The patients were selected on the basis of indications provided by GEC-ESTRO. The dose was delivered by using a mobile linear dedicated accelerator LIAC (Sordina, Padova, Italy) with electrons beams energy range between 4 and 10 MeV and it was chosen on tumour size evaluated with frozen section examination of the removed neoplasm: 18 Gy in less than 1cm tumour (pT1a-pT1b; 65 pts) and 21 Gy in larger cancer (pT1c-pT2; 134 pts). Using the Linear Quadratic Model a single dose of 21 Gy was estimated equivalent to a fractionated dose of 65-70 Gy while a single dose of 18 Gy was equivalent to 60 Gy: a lower dose might be sufficient to control a more limited disease removed with negative margins (5mm), with fewer side effects of normal tissues.

To report the 5-year minimum follow-up in low-risk breast cancer patients treated with a double-lumen balloon-brachytherapy device in one mono-institutional Italian experience. Local control data and cosmetic outcomes were collected and analyzed. Methods. Between October 2004 and December 2007, we treated 30 early stage breast cancer patients who underwent conservative surgery followed by adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation with a double-lumen balloon-brachytherapy system. Eligibility criteria for the protocol were based on the indications of the American Brachytherapy Society and the American Society of Breast Surgeons. The device was placed inside the lumpectomy cavity during surgery by open technique in all the patients. Computed tomography images and standard X-ray were used for treatment planning. The total irradiation dose was 34 Gy in 10 fractions of 3.4 Gy (twice daily) over 5 days to the lumpectomy cavity. Results. Median follow-up was 80.5 months (range, 60-98). No patient developed local recurrence or distant metastasis. At the end of treatment, there was evidence of a symptomatic seroma in 83% of the total patients, with a yearly decreasing trend. However, the incidence of mild and moderate fibrosis progressively increased. Seventy-seven percent of the patients were satisfied with their cosmetic results. Conclusions. Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that an accelerated double-lumen balloon-breast brachytherapy catheter in selected low-risk patients is safe, and a favorable cosmetic outcome can be achieved.

This experience will assess the feasibility in terms of acute and late toxicity of a retreatment with Intra Operative Radio Therapy (IORT) after conservative surgery in patients with breast cancer relapse. Materials and Methods: from September 2009 to December 2011, at our Radiotherapy Center, 17 patients (age range 52-81 year, median age 69) with local recurrence (small size: 4-15 mm) in breast cancer were submitted to IORT. All the patients had been previously irradiated for ipsilateral breast cancer (46-50 Gy in 20-25 fractions + 10 Gy boost in 5 fractions). After surgical resection of the tumor a IORT dose of 18 Gy was administered on the tumour bed, delivered with electrons beam of 6-10 MeV, through a dedicated mobile accelerator, LIAC (Sordina, Padova, Italy). Results: with a median follow-up to 6 months, we evaluated the patients in terms of acute and late toxicity, according to the RTOG and SOMA LENT scale, and also in terms of aesthetic result. We found a G1 acute toxicity, local erythema and pain, only in 6% (1 pts/17 pts) and 12% (2 pts/17 pts) respectively of the patients. It was not detected other grade of acute toxicity. Regarding the sub-acute and late toxicity (from 6 to 18 months) we founded a G1 fibrosis toxicity in 12% (2 pts/17 pts) of patients and a G3 in 6% (1 pts/17 pts) of the patients. The acute G1 skin retraction occurred in 6% (1 pts/17 pts) and G2 in 24% (4 pts/17 pts) of the patients, while the late G1 and G2 skin retraction occurred in 18% (3 pts/17) and 16% (1 pts/17 pts) of patients respectively. The cosmetic result was good, acceptable, and poor respectively in 35% (6 pts/17 pts), 59% (10 pts/17 pts) and 6% (1 pts/17 pts) of the patients. None of the patients referred to the second irradiation presented a severe (> G3) acute toxicity and/or subacute, and this could provide the late toxicity. (graph presented) Conclusions: despite the limited time follow-up does not allow the evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment to get a disease control, the absence of significant acute and sub-acute side effects is an encouraging data to continue implementation of this method. Nevertheless repeated surgery is the cause of an asymmetric result between the two breasts, the encouraging cosmetic outcomes of the IORT are very appreciated by patients who were able to maintain the integrity of body.",,0

To date, only 1 study has examined radiation's impact in autologous breast reconstruction on intraoperative vascular complications and postoperative outcomes. In this follow-up paper, we examine a larger cohort with an improved study design to better control for patient characteristics. METHODS: A database of 1780 patients who underwent autologous breast free flap reconstruction at the University of Pennsylvania's Health System between 2003 and 2014 was searched for patients who underwent bilateral breast reconstruction after unilateral radiation, returning 199 patients for review. These were then analyzed for intraoperative vascular complications as well as postoperative complications. McNemar tests were performed on all variables, comparing between radiated and nonradiated fields. RESULTS: Fields with prior radiation were significantly more likely to have any type of intraoperative vascular complication and need for arterial anastomotic revision compared to fields without prior radiation (14% versus 7%, P = 0.03 and 8% versus 3%, P = 0.04, respectively). Although there was a trend for more frequent arterial thrombosis in radiated compared to nonradiated fields, this was nonsignificant (7% versus 3%, P = 0.08). There was no significant difference in venous thrombosis or need for venous anastomotic revision. Radiated fields were significantly more likely to have postoperative wound infections compared to nonradiated fields (4% versus 0.5%, P = 0.04). There was no difference in other postoperative complications, including postoperative thrombosis, flap loss, mastectomy flap necrosis, fat necrosis, hematoma, seroma, or delayed wound healing. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative vascular complications and postoperative wound infections are significantly more likely to occur in autologous breast free flap reconstruction with previous radiation therapy. It is important to plan for and counsel patients that fields with previous radiation are at higher risk for these complications.",eng,0

Although considered a benign entity, the exact biological behavior of AVLs is not fully established because of the small number of cases reported in the literature. We aim to further characterize these lesions clinically and histopathologically, and to study their behavior. We report a series of 30 patients with AVL of the breast occurring after radiation exposure, diagnosed and treated at the European Institute of Oncology, Italy. Immunohistochemical study was performed in all cases, using CD31, D2-40, CD105, and Ki-67 antibodies. Twenty-seven patients were treated with standard doses of conventional adjuvant radiation therapy for the prior breast carcinoma. Three patients were treated with intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons. The post-radiation latency interval from breast carcinoma to AVL was 48.5 months (ranged from 1 to 146 months). Most of the lesions were classified as lymphatic type (78.6 %) based on D2-40 positivity. No extension into subcutaneous tissue or significant atypia was noted in all cases. Despite the fact that the AVL of our series have shown benign behavior in 93.3 %, one patient developed local recurrence of AVL, and two cases progressed to angiosarcoma at the previous AVL site. Further studies should be conducted to better understand the clinical behavior and to propose additional histopathologic diagnostic criteria to distinguish AVL from low grade angiosarcoma and those AVL with increased risk for malignant progression.

In this series of patients, the choice between different techniques of breast reduction (superior or inferior pedicled or with free areola-nipple graft) depended only on cancer position. The chosen technique minimized reshaping and displacement of residual glandular flaps. In September 2009, the radiotherapists at the Institute began to apply intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) to early breast cancer, and at the time of this report, more than 200 patients have been treated. This report describes two cases of reduction mammaplasty associated with this new and easily performed radiotherapy option (IORT) and discusses its advantages and cautions. Close collaboration between surgical oncologist, plastic surgeon, and radiotherapist is essential before and during surgery to obtain adequate tumor resection and good aesthetic results and to minimize postoperative complications.",,0

Reed,1997.0,Fluoroscopy-free placement of standard chest wall subcutaneous chronic venous access devices,", ","BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential benefits of using an electromagnetic detection system to guide the intraoperative placement of chronic venous access devices (CVADs). STUDY DESIGN: An electromagnetic detection system was used to guide catheter placement during 54 procedures. Surgery and radiation exposure times were recorded. An oncology nursing follow-up questionnaire assessed device function. A cost analysis was performed. Outcomes were compared to similar data from a fluoroscopic historical control group. RESULTS: Eight study patients required intraoperative fluoroscopy; in 46 procedures (85%) the electromagnetic detection system was the sole modality employed to guide CVAD placement. One line was subsequently found in the internal mammary vein (2% false negative rate). Mean surgery times for placement of CVADs were 79.5 and 84.5 minutes for the study and control groups (p = NS). Mean radiation exposure rates were 0.16 and 0.86 minutes per patient for the study and control groups (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in device function between groups. Major complications in the study group were rare. Mean cost of CVAD placement was $1993 and $2517 for the study and control groups (p = 0.005), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the electromagnetic detection system resulted in accurate placement of chest wall CVADs in the majority of patients. This resulted in significant reductions in radiation exposure and cost of CVAD placement.",eng,0

We report this condition in a 59-year-old woman who presented with a swelling in the right axilla. No breast mass was clinically evident. Mammography, ultrasonography and multiple random fine-needle breast biopsies yielded no pathological findings. No extramammary primary lesions were present. Axillary sampling was performed and histological examination revealed the presence of metastatic adenocarcinoma in three of the 12 dissected lymph nodes. Estrogen receptors were positive and immunohistochemistry pointed to a breast origin. All these data were suggestive of occult breast cancer. The patient refused any further treatment but accepted clinical and radiological follow-up. Eight years later mammography revealed in the same breast a 10-mm nodule containing microcalcifications, which was not evident at physical examination. The patient underwent a lumpectomy. Intraoperative histology was positive for breast carcinoma and complete axillary clearance was performed. Histological examination revealed a lobular invasive breast carcinoma and the presence of micrometastasis in one of the 23 removed lymph nodes. The patient was given radiotherapy to the breast and axilla and tamoxifen. At present, one year after the appearance of the primary tumor, she is free of disease. Based on this case report we suggest an eclectic approach in the management of patients with axillary metastasis from occult breast cancer, depending on the clinical, pathological and biological findings.",eng,0

A total of 552 patients with stage I and II breast cancer were managed with BCT. All patients were treated with a partial mastectomy and radiation therapy (RT). RT consisted of 45 Gy to 50 Gy external beam irradiation to the whole breast followed by a boost to the tumor bed using either electrons (232 patients), photons (15 patients), or an interstitial implant (316 patients). Local control and cosmetic outcome was compared among three patient groups based on the type of boost used. Forty-one patients had a recurrence of cancer in the treated breast for 5-, 10-, and 13-year actuarial local recurrence rates of 2.8%, 7.5%, and 11.2%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the local recurrence rates or cosmetic outcome using electrons, photons, or an interstitial implant. On multivariate analysis, only young age and margin status were associated with local recurrence. Stage I and II breast cancer patients undergoing BCT can be effectively managed with electron, photon, or interstitial implant boost techniques. Long-term local control and cosmetic outcome are excellent regardless of which boost technique is used.",eng,0

As a follow-up study, we evaluated the FI of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes and metastatic axillary lymph nodes compared to nonmetastatic sentinel and axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer. In all, 11 patients received 30 mg 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) kg(-1) bodyweight orally 3 h prior to surgery. The sentinel lymph node was marked with Nanocoll preoperatively and with a blue dye intraoperatively. Tumour excision, excision of the sentinel lymph node and an axillary lymph node dissection were performed during the same surgical session. The operation site was illuminated with blue light (400 nm) to obtain macroscopic tissue characterisation of fluorescence. Tissue samples were stored protected from light, and analysed using a fluorescence microscope. Results were correlated with histopathology. In all, 14 sentinel lymph nodes, seven axillary lymph nodes and seven primary tumours were analysed. Metastatic sentinel lymph nodes demonstrated a statistically significant higher FI than nonmetastatic sentinel lymph nodes (2630 vs 526, P<0.0001). The FI of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes, of metastatic axillary lymph nodes and of the primary tumour were comparably high, and were statistically significantly higher compared to the normal mammary tissue. Intraoperatively, only in a few cases, it was possible to recognise the metastatic sentinel lymph node macroscopically with blue light. Our study indicates that photodynamic diagnosis with ALA has a potential in the diagnosis and detection of the sentinel lymph node in patients with breast cancer, and is worth to be further investigated and developed for intraoperative photodynamic diagnosis and possibly therapy.",eng,0

We report our experience in applying FMECA in the setting of IORT procedure for breast cancer Materials: We performed a FMECA analysis for IORT process for breast cancer. We faced the following tasks: (1) Definition the work group, (2) Complete and detailed analysis of the process (flow chart and responsibility map), (3) Identification of possible failure modes, consequences and causes; (4) Quantitative analysis, by assigning Risk Probability Numbers (RPN).These were based on tabulated scores for the severity, frequency of occurrence, and de- tectability, each on a scale of 1 to 10; and (5) Search of improvements that are both feasible and effective. Results: We analyzed 46 different activities, parts of the whole process, obtaining one or more failure modes for each.For every failure mode, RPN (Risk Probability Numbers) were established, defined as:RPN= Severity X Frequency of Occurrence X Detectability, each on a scale of 1 to 10. RPN scores ranging from 8 to 540 were obtained. The six top-ranked failure modes (see table 1) were considered for process improvements. Conclusions: The multi-professional aspect is a peculiarity of IORT process, as Surgeons, Nurses, Radiotherapists, RTTs, Medical Physicists, Anaesthetist and Pathologists work very closely. Indeed, our FMECA analysis detected as minimum an activity for every professional, in the top six failure modes. We experienced FMECA as an excellent team building"" instrument, as all the involved professionals tackle each other and reach together a deeper knowledge of the whole process As well, IORT is a very high risk process, as it adds up all the risks of a surgical procedure and those of radiotherapy. FMECA technique provides a systematic method for finding vulnerabilities in a process before they result in an error. We now intend to incorporate the specific improvement we designed, into our daily practice and review the results of the whole process after their implementation.""",,0

METHOD: Retrospective survey assessing the medical files of all patients who had surgery for ductal carcinoma of the breast (maximum diameter<2 cm) in any Strasbourg hospital during the second quarter of 2002. Cases were identified from the central medical database (PMSI). Procedures were compared with national guidelines and results discussed with the healthcare professionals involved. RESULTS: In all, 154 women were referred to 19 surgeons at 8 hospitals (public: 3; private: 5) between April 1 and June 30, 2002. The number of procedures per surgeon during this period ranged from 1 to 33. Surgery occurred within the recommended time from radiologic diagnosis (i.e.<4 weeks) in only 26% of cases. There was no preoperative diagnostic staging for 14%, and no preliminary discussion at multidisciplinary team meetings for 36%. In 36% of standard axillary lymph node dissections, fewer than 10 lymph nodes were cleared. Intraoperative radiography was not mentioned for 42% of subjects with microcalcifications. The pTNM status was not reported in 44% of histology reports from 15 experienced pathologists, surgical margins were not documented in 13%, and information on vascular invasion was missing from 54%. Finally, 30% of patients received lower doses of radiation therapy than recommended. CONCLUSION: Important differences between hospitals showed the need for improvement of several processes. Better coordination between surgeons and pathologists is essential. The results of this survey point out the value of external evaluation processes to sensitize professionals and improve the overall management of patients with breast cancer.",fre,0
Journal Article,P. Fritz; F. W. Hensley; C. Berns; P. Schraube; M. Wannenmacher,1996.0,First experiences with superfractionated skin irradiations using large afterloading molds,", ","PURPOSE: Radiotherapy of cutaneous metastases of breast cancer requires large radiation fields and high doses. This report examines the effectiveness and sequelae of superfractionated irradiation of cutaneous metastases of breast cancer with afterloading molds on preirradiated and nonirradiated skin. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A flexible reusable skin mold was developed for use with a pulsed (PDR) afterloader. An array of 18 parallel catheters was sewn between two foam rubber slabs 5 mm in thickness to provide a defined constant distance to the skin. By selection of appropriate dwell positions, arbitrarily shaped skin areas can be irradiated up to a maximal field size of 17 x 23.5 cm2. Irradiations are performed with a nominal 37 GBq 192Ir stepping source in pulses of 1 Gy/h at the skin surface. The dose distribution is geometrically optimized. The 80 and 50% dose levels lie 5 and 27 mm below the skin surface. Sixteen patients suffering from metastases at the thoracic wall were treated with 18 fields (78-798 cm2) and total doses of 40-50 Gy applying two PDR split courses with a pause of 4-6 weeks. Eleven of the fields had been previously irradiated with external beam therapy to doses of 50-60 Gy at 7-22 months in advance. RESULTS: For preirradiated fields (n = 10) the results were as follows: follow-up 4.5-28.5 months (median 17); local control (LC): 8 of 10; acute skin reactions: Grade 2 (moist desquamation) 2 of 10; intermediate/late skin reactions after minimum follow-up of 3 months: Grade 1 (atrophy/pigmentation): 2 of 10, Grade 2-3a (minimal/marked teleangiectasia): 7 of 10, Grade 4 (ulcer): 1 of 10; recurrencies: 2 of 10. For newly irradiated fields (n = 7) results were: follow-up: 2-20 months (median 5); LC: 6 of 7; acute reactions: Grade 1: 4 of 7, Grade 2: 3 of 7; intermediate/late skin reactions after minimum follow-up of 3 months (n = 5): Grade 2-3a: 2 of 5; recurrencies: 0 of 7. Local control could be achieved in 82% of the mold fields. Geometric optimization was mandatory to achieve a homogeneous dose distribution on the skin. CONCLUSION: Superfractionated brachytherapy with skin molds is an effective alternative for the treatment of skin metastases of breast cancer even if the skin is preirradiated. This method is economically advantageous compared to external beam therapy, which would require several weeks. At the curved chest wall, optimized molds can provide better dose homogeneity than abutted electron fields. Skin reactions are comparable to the sequelae of orthovolt irradiation. In preirradiated areas, PDR doses should be restricted to 40-45 Gy. PDR doses of 50 Gy seem to be the limit for tolerance even in previously unirradiated fields.",eng,0
Journal Article,A. Fromont; J. M. Nogaret; F. De Neubourg; C. Philippson,2016.0,[Not Available],", ","Male breast cancer is a rare disease, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancer cases. It is often diagnosed late, at a more advanced stage than its female counterpart. Therefore, it is more commonly treated with mastectomy. In early stages, a conservative treatment associating lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and whole-breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is possible and has been described. Recently, intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT) has been assessed as an alternative to EBRT in selected female breast cancer cases. Its use has never been described in male patients. In this article, we present the case of a 56 years old man treated with lumpectomy with the excision of the nipple-areola complex, SLN biopsy, and IORT with electron beams (IOERT), for early breast cancer disease. This case demonstrates that the IORT technique is feasible on men with early breast cancer (pT1N0).",fre,0

With the application of multilumen balloon (MLB), dose shaping becomes possible. The purpose of this study is to report initial dosimetric experience with two kinds of MLB, Contura and Multilumen MammoSite (ML MammoSite), to deliver APBI. Materials/Methods: Twenty patients were treated with MLB brachytherapy, twelve with Contura and eight with ML MammoSite. Contura MLB has five lumens; the four equal spaced peripheral lumens are 5 mm away from the central lumen. ML MammoSite MLB has four lumens; the three equal spaced peripheral lumens are 3 mm away from the central lumen. Computed tomography-based three-dimensional planning with dose optimization was performed using Nucletron Plato planning system. The dosimetric goals were (1) >95% of the prescribed dose (PD), V<inf>95%</inf>, covering >90% of the target volume, (2) maximum skin dose, Skin<inf>max</inf>, <125% of the PD, (3) maximum rib dose, Rib<inf>max</inf>, <145% of the PD (if possible), and (4) the volume of breast tissue that receives more than 150% of PD, V<inf>150%</inf>, <50 cc, and the volume of breast tissue that receives more than 200% of PD, V<inf>200%</inf>, <10 cc. Results: For the twelve patients with Contura MLB, the median of minimum skin spacing was 8 mm (range, 3-14 mm), four patients were treated with a skin spacing<7 mm. The median of minimum rib spacing was 7 mm (1-33 mm). The dosimetric results are shown in table. All the dosimetric goals were met for eleven patients. One case of V200% was more than 10 cc due to pushing the high dose away from the rib with a rib spacing of 1 mm. For the eight patients with MLMammoSite MLB, the median of minimum skin spacing was 10mm(6-22 mm), two patients were treated with a skin spacing<7 mm. The median of minimum rib spacing was 10 mm (1-27 mm). The dosimetric results are shown in table. All the dosimetric goals were met for seven patients. The maximum rib dose of 176% PD was for a case of skin spacing of 7 mm and rib spacing of 1 mm. Conclusions: Although the geometric design of Contura and Multilumen MammoSite MLB is different, both applicators have shown the ability of dose shaping for providing sufficient target coverage while concurrently limiting dose to skin and rib.

Santos,2016.0,Paravertebral block for management of acute postoperative pain and intercostobrachial neuralgia in major breast surgery,10.1016/j.bjane.2015.02.007,"BACKGROUND: Several locoregional techniques have been described for the management of acute and chronic pain after breast surgery. The optimal technique should be easy to perform, reproducible, with little discomfort to the patient, little complications, allowing good control of acute pain and a decreased incidence of chronic pain, namely intercostobrachial neuralgia for being the most frequent entity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the paravertebral block with preoperative single needle prick for major breast surgery and assess initially the control of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and acute pain in the first 24h and secondly the incidence of neuropathic pain in the intercostobrachial nerve region six months after surgery. METHODS: The study included 80 female patients, ASA I-II, aged 18-70 years, undergoing major breast surgery, under general anesthesia, stratified into 2 groups: general anesthesia (inhalation anesthesia with opioids, according to hemodynamic response) and paravertebral (paravertebral block with single needle prick in T4 with 0.5% ropivacaine+adrenaline 3mugmL(-1) with a volume of 0.3mLkg(-1) preoperatively and subsequent induction and maintenance with general inhalational anesthesia). In the early postoperative period, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was placed with morphine set for bolus on demand for 24h. Intraoperative fentanyl, postoperative morphine consumption, technique-related complications, pain at rest and during movement were recorded at 0h, 1h, 6h and 24h, as well as episodes of PONV. All variables identified as factors contributing to pain chronicity age, type of surgery, anxiety according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), preoperative pain, monitoring at home; body mass index (BMI) and adjuvant chemotherapy/radiation therapy were analyzed, checking the homogeneity of the samples. Six months after surgery, the incidence of neuropathic pain in the intercostobrachial nerve was assessed using the DN4 scale. RESULTS: The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) values of paravertebral group at rest were lower throughout the 24h of study 0h 1.90 (+/-2.59) versus 0.88 (+/-1.5) 1h 2.23 (+/-2.2) versus 1.53 (+/-1.8) 6h 1.15 (+/-1.3) versus 0.35 (+/-0.8); 24h 0.55 (+/-0.9) versus 0.25 (+/-0.8) with statistical significance at 0h and 6h. Regarding movement, paravertebral group had VAS values lower and statistically significant in all four time points: 0h 2.95 (+/-3.1) versus 1.55 (+/-2.1); 1h 3.90 (+/-2.7) versus 2.43 (+/-1.9) 6h 2.75 (+/-2.2) versus 1.68 (+/-1.5); 24h 2.43 (+/-2.4) versus 1.00 (+/-1.4). The paravertebral group consumed less postoperative fentanyl (2.38+/-0.81mugkg(-1) versus 3.51+/-0.81mugkg(-1)) and morphine (3.5mg+/-3.4 versus 7mg+/-6.4) with statistically significant difference. Chronic pain evaluation of at 6 months of paravertebral group found fewer cases of neuropathic pain in the intercostobrachial nerve region (3 cases versus 7 cases), although not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Single-injection paravertebral block allows proper control of acute pain with less intraoperative and postoperative consumption of opioids but apparently it cannot prevent pain chronicity. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of paravertebral block in pain chronicity in major breast surgery.",eng,0

Since ELIOT is associated with much reduced irradiation to nontarget tissues, we carried out a study on nonpregnant breast cancer patients to estimate doses to the uterus during ELIOT to better evaluate the possible use of ELIOT in pregnant breast cancer patients. We performed in vivo dosimetry with thermoluminescence radiation detectors (TLDs) in 15 premenopausal patients receiving ELIOT to the breast (prescribed dose 21 Gy) using two mobile linear accelerators. The TLDs were positioned subdiaphragmatically on the irradiated side, at the medial pubic position, and within the uterus. A shielding apron (2 mm lead equivalent) was placed over the viscera from the subcostal to the subpubic region. TLDs showed mean doses of 3.7 mGy (range 1-8.5 mGy) at subdiaphragm, 0.9 mGy (range 0.3-2 mGy) pubic, and 1.7 mGy (range 0.6-3.2 mGy) in utero, for beam energies in the range 5-9 MeV. These findings indicate that ELIOT with a mobile linear accelerator and shielding apron would be safe for the fetus, as doses of a few mGy are not associated with measurable increased risk of fetal damage, and the threshold dose for deterministic effects is estimated at 100-200 mGy. We conclude that studies on the use of ELIOT in pregnant women treated with conservative breast surgery are justified. © 2008 Society of Surgical Oncology.",,0

In the present study we assessed whether the rate of axillary disease was sufficiently low on long term follow-up to consolidate the policy of AD avoidance. Methods We retrospectively analysed data on 5262 consecutive primary breast cancer patients with clinically negative axilla and negative SN, treated from 1996 to 2006, who did not receive AD. We used univariate and multivariate analyses to assess the influence of patient and tumour characteristics on first events and survival. The primary endpoint was the development of axillary disease as first event. Results After a median follow-up of 7.0 years (interquartile range 5.4-8.9 years) survival for the series was high (91.3%; 95% CI 90.3-92.3 at 10 years) and only 91 (1.7%) patients developed axillary disease as first event. Axillary disease was significantly more frequent in patients with the following characteristics: <35 years at diagnosis, tumour >1 cm, multifocality/multicentricity, G3, ductal histotype, Ki67 > 30%, peritumoral vascular invasion, luminal B-like subtype, HER2 positivity, mastectomy, and not receiving radiotherapy. Conclusion Long-term follow-up of our large series confirms that axillary metastasis is infrequent when AD is omitted in SN-negative breast cancer patients, and has low impact on overall survival.

Materials: Under the hypothesis of a strong correlation between surgical clips and tumour bed, excluding patients where breast was remodelled by plastic surgeon, surgical clips, placed at the periphery of the tumour bed during lumpectomy can be used as radiographic markers visualized by ExacTrac Xray (ETX, BrainLAB, Germany). Ten patients have been enrolled in the study so far. They received a dose of 12 Gy to the tumor bed with IORT followed by a whole breast tangential fields irradiation with a dose of 37.05 Gy delivered in 13 fractions. The lumpectomy cavity was defined by 4-6 surgical clips placed by the surgeon after IORT. All patients underwent a free breathing (FB) and an end-expiration breath-hold (EEBH) CT scans with 3 mm thick slices in order to evaluate the influence of respiration in the localization of the tumor bed. All visible surgical clips were outlined in both CT scans to calculate their motion and to have a better visualization on the DRRs. Patients were positioned using lasers alignment to skin tattoos, two couples of X-ray images were acquired in FB and EEBH and compared to the corresponding DRRs using manual fusion to align the clips to evaluate localization error. Another couple of X-ray images was acquired in FB after correction to assess residual error. Localization and residual errors were evaluated during the first 8 fractions. To estimate of the CTV to PTV margin we have considered breathing motion and residual errors. Results: The internal clip motion between FB and EE was, -1.7+/-1.1 mm, -1.5+/-1.2 mm, 0.9+/-0.8 mm in AP, SI and LR, respectively. For all patients the clips were clearly visible in one X-ray image while some difficulties were found in the second image because some of the clips were hidden by bony anatomy. In the table are shown the localization errors in FB and EEBH and the residual error in FB along the three directions. No improvement in clip localization have been observed acquiring the X-ray images in EEBH compared to FB. Estimating a breathing motion of about 3-4 mm, we have calculated an isotropic CTV to PTV margin, including breathing and residual errors, of 6 mm. (Figure presented) Conclusions: On-linelocalization of surgical clips using ETX is technical feasible for IGRT in partial breast irradiation. CTV to PTV margins may be reduced from conventional 10 mm to 6 mm allowing more patients to be eligible for PBI. Further reduction of margins would require a better characterization of the target surrogate.",,0

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) has been evaluated in the setting of early-stage breast cancer in Europe and more recently the U.S. with noninferior results. Based upon size, hormone reception expression and other factors, these malignancies are believed to represent a less aggressive phenotype than node-positive, hormone receptor-negative lesions. Recurrence risk as determined from multigene assays has been utilized to guide decisions for adjuvant chemotherapy by stratifying node-negative breast cancers into low, intermediate, or high risk for distant recurrence based on their genomic profile. We therefore sought to evaluate the Oncotype DX (Genomic Health) recurrence score (RS) as a component of a retrospective review evaluating the characteristics of our IORT cohort in order to determine if these early-stage lesions deemed appropriate for IORT have a lower risk for recurrence based on their tumor characteristics. Methods A multicenter, retrospective chart review was performed on patients with invasive breast carcinoma who were eligible for and received IORT over a 2-year period. Data collection included patient demographics (age, race, medical history), tumor characteristics (size, grade, receptor status, histopathologic results), nodal status, mode of delivery/duration of IORT, Oncotype DX RS score (if available), and adjuvant therapy decisions. Results A total of 64 patients were identified. Of these, 60% (n = 38) had Oncotype DX score available. The majority of these lesions were stage Ia (89.5%), and the remainder were stage IIa invasive duct carcinoma (10.5%). Of the 38 patients who received RS portfolios, 68.4% (n = 26) were determined low risk for recurrence (Oncotype DX scores 0-17), with 31.6% (n = 12) at intermediate risk for 5-year recurrence (assuming tamoxifen therapy for 5 years). From a histologic perspective, 66% (n = 25 pts) of patients who received IORT for invasive criteria also had at least 1 focus of DCIS present, and half of the patients deemed intermediate (RS scores 18-30) had grade 2 or 3 Nottingham scores and additional foci of DCIS present. Nearly 40% (n = 25) patients who received IORT had no Oncotype score obtained; reasons for this included: documented low index of suspicion of recurrence risk due to small tumors and favorable histology (mucinous, n = 2), patient refusal (n = 1), and poor performance status (n = 1). Conclusion More data are needed to determine if patient selection for IORT truly embodies the population of patients with favorable tumor biology. Though not entirely surprising, the wide range of Oncotype scores for these mainly stage Ia tumors, combined with the presence of concomitant DCIS on final pathology in intermediate risk, grade 2 and 3 invasive ductal carcinomas may provide additional support for obtaining Oncotype DX scores in the majority of patients who undergo IORT as an alternative for adjuvant radiation for invasive disease. Future directions will seek to evaluate long-term follow-up data to assess disease-free survival and recurrence.",,0

A portable IORT equipment with different electron energies was used. From July to December 1999, a total of 65 patients with T1-2 (max. 2.5 cm) NO-1 breast cancer, median age 58 years (range 33-80 years) was treated. Ten patients received 10 Gy, eight patients were treated with an IORT of 15 Gy, eight received 17 Gy, six had 19 Gy, and 33 were treated with 21-22 Gy.

Conclusions: Since the applicator can be safely placed under the control of the surgeon and radiotherapist IORT has the potential of accurately treating the tumor bed. Skin and subcutaneous tissue are not irradiated thus decreasing the potential risk of fibrosis and eventually obtaining a better cosmesis.

Stability in osteolytic lesions results from recalcification that can be detected several weeks after cessation of radiotherapy. Different fractionation regimens exist from days to several weeks. These regimens do not differ in their analgesic potency but more protracted radiotherapy results in a higher rate of stability and less re-irradiation. Modern radiotherapy modalities, i. e. stereotactic IMRT or the combination of kyphoplasty and intraoperative radiotherapy with 50 kV photons (Kypho-IORT) allow radiotherapy of complicated fields in vicinity of organs at risk. Therefore, repeated radiotherapy becomes an option even after short intervals. Antiresorptive agents or anti-hormone therapy (in breast- or prostate cancer) should be incorporated whenever indicated. Post-operative radiotherapy with the goal of tumour-cell sterilisation should always be implemented after surgical stabilisation or tumour debulking/laminectomy in case of myelocompression.

In case of discordance between a negative"" FS analysis and definitive histology, an ALND as a second operation is advocated since additional lymph node metastases may be present. The clinical implications of the subsequent ALND in these patients were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2000 and May 2008, 879 consecutive breast cancer patients underwent surgery including sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with intraoperative FS analysis of 2 central cuts from axillary SLNs. Following fixation and serial sectioning, SLNs were further examined postoperatively with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical techniques. For patients with a discordant FS examination, the effect of the pathology findings of the subsequent ALND specimen on subsequent nonsurgical therapy were evaluated. RESULTS: FS analysis detected axillary metastases in the SLN(s) in 200 patients (23%), while the definitive pathology examination detected metastases in SLNs in another 151 patients (17%). A complementary ALND was performed in 108 of the 151 patients with discordant FS. Additional tumor positive axillary lymph nodes were found in 17 patients (16%), leading to ""upstaging"" in 7 (6%). Subsequent nonsurgical treatment was adjusted in 4 patients (4%): all 4 had more extensive locoregional radiotherapy; no patient received additional hormonal and/or chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Discordance between intraoperative FS analysis and definitive histology of SLNs is common. In this selection of patients, a substantial proportion had additional lymph node metastases, but postsurgical treatment was rarely adjusted based on the findings of the complementary ALND.""",eng,0

It can be advantageous for well-selected patients to avoid 3-6 weeks of post-operative WBI. It also eliminates any uncertainty in localization of the surgical bed in external beam (EBRT) boost. The results of the randomized controlled trial TARGIT-A have been published to demonstrate non-inferiority to WBI in properly selected early breast cancer patients. TARGIT-B, an ongoing trial, compares the outcomes of tumor bed boost delivered by external beam and IORT. Our study utilizes the ASTRO 2009 consensus guideline, the TARGIT-A and TARGIT-B criteria in selecting patients. We report the early radiation treatment related outcomes of our single institution prospective cohort study using the Intrabeam system. Materials/Methods: All eligible patients were entered consecutively into the cohort. Patients meeting criteria of the ASTRO consensus and TARGIT- A trial received IORT as the sole definitive radiation treatment. If surgical pathology revealed findings incompatible with IORT alone, EBRT was added. Patients who did not qualify for IORT as a single modality were eligible to receive IORT as a boost in lieu of an EBRT boost, similar to the TARGIT-B trial. The Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale, IORT related and surgical outcomes were assessed. Results: Sixty-nine patients were entered into the cohort between September 2011 and October 2012. Four patients did not subsequently receive IORT. Among the remaining 65 patients treated with IORT, the average age was 63.3 years with a median follow-up of 13 months. Tumors are 15% DCIS vs 85% invasive cancer (71% pT1 and 14% pT2). Eighty-five percent of patients are N0 or N1 (mi). The remaining 15% are N1. Hormone receptor status is ER+ 94%, PR+85% and Her2+ 7%. 67.7% received IORT alone, while 32.3% had additional EBRT. The Harvard Breast Cosmesis Scale was measured at 3, 6, and 12 months. Cosmesis was rated as 77% excellent outcome, while 23% good with no fair or poor results. Acute RTOG G3 and G4 complications were 1.5% and 3.1%. Two G4 radionecrosis cases received EBRT. Hyperbaric O2 was given with recovery at follow-ups. Post-operative complications included surgery in 7.7% for wound infection and 1.5% for surgically evacuated hematomas. No patients required having >3 aspirations of a seroma. No long-term complications were noted. Conclusions: Acute complication rates in patients who received IORT alone are comparable to the results of the TARGIT-A trial. IORT as a boost in addition to EBRT may affect those rates. The TARGIT-B trial will further elucidate this question. Excellent and good cosmetic outcomes are achievable in this early report of our study.",,0

The Dosi- MeV of DosiSecure used more commonly to perform the IVD of electron radiotherapy was studied experimentally for use in X-rays of low energy. Materials and methods: The device used for operative procedures is an Intrabeam (Carl Zeiss Medical, Germany) which uses X-rays with an accelerating voltage of 50kV (mean energy spectrum 20 keV). A DosiMeV calibration has been done for this specific radiation. Then, depth-dose, repeatability, reproducibility and angular dependence of the DosiMeV were evaluated. The effect of radio-transparency was also investigated. These measurements were carried out using a 35 mm diameter applicator, since it is the most commonly used. The first clinical measurements allowed to evaluate the intra-cavitary dose and the skin dose during a standard procedure (20 Gy). The control of the dose deposited in the skin seems to be more interesting to assess the importance of side effects. Results: Depth-dose measurements with DosiMeV corresponds quite well with the theoretical data with a maximal gap of 6%. The variation coefficient of repeatability was estimated at 0,4%. The variation coefficient of reproducibility was estimated at 0,6%. Angular variations results are pending. Average results from 5 clinical applications gave a mean intracavitary dose of 20,66 Gy and a mean skin dose of 1,49 Gy. Conclusion: The use of a DosiMeV to perform the IVD on Intrabeam technology seems to be conclusive. The first experimental results appear to be satisfactory and, to confirm them, 20 to 25 more patients will be added to the present study from now till June.",,0

Bloom,2013.0,A new paradigm for calculating skin dose,10.1016/j.brachy.2012.05.005,"PURPOSE: Most institutions model breast epidermis with a surface contour and record the maximum dose on the external surface of the patient. The objective of this study was to compare the external surface contour (ext) model of the skin with our current volumetric model for skin for radiation treatment planning in accelerated partial breast irradiation brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A literature search was conducted to identify studies measuring breast epidermal thickness. Clinical plans were performed with a 2-mm contraction of the external surface contour. This 2-mm contraction of the external surface contour was used to approximate breast epidermis thickness. Then, the external surface contour was expanded 5mm outside the external contour of the patient for the second skin model. Maximum doses from the two models were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The average breast epidermal thickness from five studies was 1.68mm. Mean percent difference between skin and ext+5mm for balloon plans, strut plans, and all plans was 10.1%, 14.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. Differences in doses between the two skin models were statistically significant (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The volumetric skin model was validated because the average breast epidermal thickness was 1.68mm. The surface model for skin may underestimate the dose delivered to the epidermis by as much as 23.8%. The external surface contour method does not accurately represent the dermatologic skin thickness of the breast as the skin is modeled as a surface rather than a volume. These discrepancies may skew correlations of dose to skin and toxicity determinations.",eng,0

The radiation was provided by an Iridium-192 source, and 340 cGy were delivered per fraction twice daily. We calculated some commonly used dosimetric parameters, and evaluated the biological parameters tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). We also looked for correlations among these parameters. The average equivalent uniform dose (EUD), NTCP, and TCP were 43.66 Gy, 47.95%, and 91.78%, respectively. The coefficient of variation (CV) among the patients was very low for all 3 parameters. Two dose homogeneity indices (DHI and the S-index) are strongly correlated (r = -0.815). The area under the dose-volume histogram (DVH) and the treatment volume (TXV) also showed a strong correlation (r = 0.995, p < 0.0001). A simplified logit Poisson-EUD model is suitable for determining NTCP and TCP. Other factors such as the area under the DVH and dose homogeneity indices are also useful in planning radiotherapy treatments for early breast cancer.",eng,0

We have now assessed long-term clinical efficacy including disease-free survival and disease outcomes in patients receiving anastrozole or tamoxifen with or without zoledronic acid. Methods: ABSCG-12 is a randomised, controlled, open-label, two-by-two factorial, multicentre trial in 1803 premenopausal women with endocrine-receptor-positive early-stage (stage I-II) breast cancer receiving goserelin (3.6 mg every 28 days), comparing the efficacy and safety of anastrozole (1 mg per day) or tamoxifen (20 mg per day) with or without zoledronic acid (4 mg every 6 months) for 3 years. Randomisation (1:1:1:1 ratio) was computerised and based on the Pocock and Simon minimisation method to balance the four treatment arms across eight prognostic variables (age, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, pathological tumour stage; lymph-node involvement, type of surgery or locoregional therapy, complete axillary dissection, intraoperative radiation therapy, and geographical region). Treatment allocation was not masked. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (defined as disease recurrence or death) and analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00295646; follow-up is ongoing. Findings: At a median follow-up of 62 months (range 0-114.4 months), more than 2 years after treatment completion, 186 disease-free survival events had been reported (53 events in 450 patients on tamoxifen alone, 57 in 453 patients on anastrozole alone, 36 in 450 patients on tamoxifen plus zoledronic acid, and 40 in 450 patients on anastrozole plus zoledronic acid). Zoledronic acid reduced risk of disease-free survival events overall (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51-0.91; p=0.009), although the difference was not significant in the tamoxifen (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44-1.03; p=0.067) and anastrozole arms (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.45-1.02; p=0.061) assessed separately. Zoledronic acid did not significantly affect risk of death (30 deaths with zoledronic acid vs 43 deaths without; HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41-1.07; p=0.09). There was no difference in disease-free survival between patients on tamoxifen alone versus anastrozole alone (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.81-1.44; p=0.591), but overall survival was worse with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (46 vs 27 deaths; HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.08-2.83; p=0.02). Treatments were generally well tolerated, with no reports of renal failure or osteonecrosis of the jaw. Bone pain was reported in 601 patients (33%; 349 patients on zoledronic acid vs 252 not on the drug), fatigue in 361 (20%; 192 vs 169), headache in 280 (16%; 147 vs 133), and arthralgia in 266 (15%; 145 vs 121). Interpretation: Addition of zoledronic acid improved disease-free survival in the patients taking anastrozole or tamoxifen. There was no difference in disease-free survival between patients receiving anastrozole and tamoxifen overall, but those on anastrozole alone had inferior overall survival. These data show persistent benefits with zoledronic acid and support its addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer.

Our objective was to assess short-term clinical and sonographic findings after breast conservation (BCT) and IORT. Methods: An IRB-approved, single institution retrospective chart review was conducted of patients (pts) treated with BCT/IORT from 1/2011- 6/2012. Follow-up clinical breast exams and ultrasounds (US) obtained 6 and 12months after BCT/IORT were retrospectively reviewed by a breast radiologist (JD) for sonographic findings (Table 1). Pvalues were calculated using McNemar's test, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, and Chi-square. Results: 71pts underwent BCT/IORT. Mean age was 71.6 yrs (range 54-88). Of 71pts, 10 (14%) / 5 (7%) pts were symptomatic at 6/12month follow- up respectively. Eleven pts had deep tissue closure (DTC) of the lumpectomy cavity with 5/11 (45%) DTC pts being symptomatic at follow-up vs. 5/60 (8%) without DTC. 38/71 (54%) pts had at least one US; 35pts had 6month US (22 without a 12month US) and 16pts had a 12month US (3 without a 6month US). All 38pts had a seroma but, 10/38 (26%) pts were symptomatic. At 6months, 9/35 (26%) pts had a symptomatic seroma [7 (78%) with pain and 2 (22%) with overlying skin hyperemia]. Two pts required seroma aspirations at 6months; 1 had repeat aspiration at 12months. At 1-year follow-up, 4/9 (44%) pts had persistent symptoms. One asymptomatic pt at 6months reported pain at 1 year despite no change in seroma appearance [total 5/16 (31%)]. At 6 months, DTC resulted in smaller seroma cavity volumes compared to those without closure (p = 0.03). However there was no difference in cavity resorption between the two groups over time (p = 0.67) and no significant change in seroma volume or wall thickness for either group. There was no difference in sonographic findings between the two groups at 6/12months. Conclusion: Presence of a seroma is commonplace post BCT/IORT; symptomatic seromas are uncommon. DTC generated smaller but more symptomatic seromas. Longer follow-up with serial US performed in all BCT/IORT pts is advisable to document natural progression of symptoms and seromas.

The integration of IORT into cancer treatment programs, made possible by the new technologies of mobile linear accelerators that can be used in unshielded operating rooms, makes IORT significantly less time-consuming, less costly, and less risky to administer. It is now practical for IORT to be used in early-stage disease, in addition to advanced disease, and in sites for which patient transportation in the middle of surgery is considered too risky. Preliminary results of trials for early-stage breast and rectal cancer indicate benefits of IORT. Pediatric patients and patients who have lung cancer, previously underserved by IORT therapies, can be offered potential gains when patient transport issues do not limit IORT. Furthermore, because many of these mobile systems require no shielding, it is now practical for mobile units to be shared between hospitals, making this new mobile technology much more widely available.",,0

Starting with 1996, a single surgical team, among others at the Bucharest Oncology Institute,performed BCT in 497 patients out of the total 2,256 cases of breast cancer treated. Work protocol consisted of tumour excision with safety margins, intraoperative histology exam,samples from all the walls of the remaining cavity, with intraoperative histology exam, axillary lymphadenectomy, followed by mandatory irradiation of the entire breast, associated or not with systemic or hormonal adjuvant treatment. 38 patients developed local disease recurrences, 14 of which in the first 5 years.

Journal Article,H. T. Gold; M. K. Hayes,2012.0,Cost effectiveness of new breast cancer radiotherapy technologies in diverse populations,10.1007/s10549-012-2242-y,"Accelerated partial breast radiotherapy (RT) strategies (3-D conformal external-beam RT (3-D CRT) and brachytherapy with balloon catheter) reduce time and transportation burdens of whole breast RT for breast cancer. Long-term clinical trial evidence is unavailable for accelerated modalities, but uncertainty might be acceptable for patients likely to receive suboptimal whole breast RT. The objective of this study is to assess the cost effectiveness of accelerated partial breast RT compared to on-time and delayed whole breast RT. The design used in this study is decision analytic Markov model. The data sources are published literature; and national/federal sources. The target population of this study is a hypothetical cohort of 60 years old women previously treated with breast-conserving surgery for node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with tumors <1 cm. The time horizon is 15 years, and the perspective is societal. The interventions are whole breast RT, 3-D CRT, and brachytherapy breast irradiation. The outcome measures are costs (2008 US$), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The base-case results were: 3-D CRT was the preferred strategy, costing on average $10,800 and yielding 11.21 QALYs. On-time whole breast RT costs $368,000/QALY compared to 3-D CRT, above the $100,000/QALY WTP threshold. 3-D CRT was also preferred over delayed whole breast RT. Brachytherapy was never preferred. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were sensitive to the rate of recurrence outside the initial tumor quadrant (elsewhere failure"") in one-way analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that results were sensitive to parameter uncertainty, and that the elsewhere-failure rate and treatment preferences may drive results. The limitation of this study is that efficacy estimates are derived from studies that may not fully represent the population modeled. As a conclusion, 3-D CRT was preferred to whole breast RT and for women likely to delay RT, indicating that 3-D CRT could be targeted more efficiently before randomized trial evidence.""",eng,0

METHODS: A literature review was performed using the PubMed search engine, with articles selected based on standardized criteria. Additional articles included those known to the authors and those obtained by review of references from key studies. RESULTS: The reported incidence of NAC involvement ranges from 0 to 58 %. The most commonly associated factors with NAC involvement include tumor-to-NAC distance, tumor size, central location of the primary tumor, multicentricity/multifocality, and positive axillary lymph nodes. Following NSM, in the setting of proper patient selection, rates of NAC recurrence are generally low, with the majority of studies reporting rates ranging from 0 to 4 %. There is a paucity of data evaluating the role of RT after NSM and a lack of level I evidence, with the largest series documenting low rates of local recurrence with RT but failing to provide a control arm without radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal preoperative patient selection for NSM and intraoperative assessment of the NAC result in acceptably low rates of NAC involvement/recurrence. NSM alone is not adequate justification for post-mastectomy radiation. NSM should be taken into consideration to inform radiation decision making only when preoperative imaging, clinical features, or pathologic findings suggest higher risk for NAC involvement.",eng,0

Pts with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) fall into a cautionary"" group for APBI. We reviewed our single-institution experience with APBI in pts with ILC to determine safety and patterns of recurrence. Methods: From January 2005 to November 2009, 24 pts with ILC treated with BCS and APBI were identified. Twenty-three pts received APBI via balloon catheter brachytherapy; one pt received 3-D conformal PBI. The primary endpoint was time to locoregional recurrence (LRR). Secondary endpoint was time to distant metastases. Results: Median age at diagnosis was 67 and median tumor size was 1.3 cm. Median follow-up was 2.5 yrs.

Therefore, late toxicity is of particular interest. We aimed to compare late toxicity and cosmetic results in patients receiving standard treatment with different radiation therapy boost strategies. Materials/Methods: One hundred thirty women with T1 or T2 breast tumors received BCS and postoperative 50 Gy of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the whole breast in 2 Gy fractions. Group 1 (n = 72) received a 9 Gy IORT electron boost directly to the tumor bed using a mobile electron linear accelerator. Group 2 (n = 58) received an EBRT electron boost or a pulsed dose rate brachytherapy boost after whole breast irradiation. Patient groups were comparable for age, menopausal status, histological tumor type, tumor grading, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Late toxicity and global cosmetic results were scored according to the LENT SOMA scale and four-point scale respectively. Results: After a median follow-up period of 40 [24-56] months in group 1 and 45 [20-57] months in group 2, there was no significant difference in late toxicity rates. The observed rates of grade 3 or 4 toxicity in group 1 and 2 were 1.4% versus 0% for atrophy, 4.2% versus 5.2% for fibrosis, 0% versus 1.7% for telangiectasia and 0% versus 1.7% for pain. Cosmetic outcome was not significantly different between both groups, and was good to excellent in most patients, with only 2 patients in group 1 and 1 patient in group 2 having a poor cosmetic outcome. Group 1 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly higher rate of highgrade toxicity, compared to patients receiving no chemotherapy. This finding was not observed in group 2 and we found no such correlation for adjuvant hormonal therapy. Finally, there was no significant difference in amount of distortions on follow-up imaging between group 1 and 2. Conclusions: Our data show an acceptable late toxicity profile and a good cosmetic outcome after an IORT electron boost, comparable to other boost methods. IORT has no impact on the interpretation of follow-up imaging. Chemotherapy seems to be associated with more toxicity in IORT patients.",,0

Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) using a balloon applicator is a relatively new technique for post lumpectomy breast cancer radiation treatment. Balloon to skin spacing distance with this treatment modality may be a major concern. If the skin to balloon distance is less than 7mm, the procedure may not be recommended due to adverse skin reactions leading to poor cosmesis. This is of particular concern for patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. We suggest a novel approach for reducing skin doses to an acceptable level when the balloon-to-skin distance is inadequate. We study a real-time imaging and dose verification method for a proposed shielded balloon applicator using high resolution miniature gamma camera and scintillation fiber technology. Materials and Methods: The skin spacing issue may be overcome by partially shielding the radiation dose to the skin using fine grains of iron or other ferrous powder. The powder will be injected into the balloon along with inflating saline solution when a skin spacing problem is encountered. A magnetic field of predetermined configuration will be applied externally to arrange the powders internally under the segment of surface of the balloon where the skin spacing is less than 7 mm, thereby protecting the skin from radiation damage. Shielding material may be controlled by a relatively weak magnetic field. This method will allow reducing the skin dose by partially shielding the radiation dose whenever the balloon-to-skin spacing is inadequate. The information on the source position within the balloon and the dose delivered to the breast may be verified using MOSFET and scintillating fiber technology. Real-time imaging and dose verification may also be obtained using a gamma camera to image a reference source of known radioactivity placed on the surface of the patient and comparing it to the activity observed in the tumor bed by injecting a Tc-99m based imaging agent into the balloon along with the saline solution. The uniformity, position and the thickness of metal shield may be verified using a combination of the suggested imaging and dose verification methods. (Figure presented) Results: Our Monte Carlo simulation studies of the amounts of shielding material required and the magnetic field strength necessary to control the shielding media are promising. Balloon applicator geometry and the <sup>192</sup>Ir source were reconstructed in detail in the simulation program. Our preliminary results indicate that if, for example, the skin-to-balloon spacing is only 4 mm then about a 1-mm thin layer of iron powder will decrease the skin dose to an acceptable level (350-450 cGy). Our laboratory tests show that only a slight magnetic field is required to bring such a small amount of ferrous powders to controllable configuration. Conclusions: This project, taken from bench to bedside, will increase the number of patients eligible for APBI and minimize negative side effects in BCT, as well as improve cosmetic outcome for all APBI patients treated. Proposed techniques and technology may be used not only in breast cancer radiotherapy but also, for example, for balloon brachytherapy of brain, heart, rectal, and vaginal cancers.",,0
Journal Article,A. Goyal,2009.0,Management of the axilla in patients with breast cancer,10.1007/s12262-009-0089-1,"This article reviews the changes in management of the axilla in patients with breast cancer in the last decade. It discusses the recent advances, existing controversies and provides evidence-based guidelines for use in clinical practice.Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has replaced the more morbid axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and four node sampling for axillary nodal staging. Blue dye guided four node sampling is an acceptable alternative when radioisotope facilities are not available. ALND is reserved for patients with proven axillary lymph node involvement.Preoperative axillary ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytology or core biopsy of suspicious lymph nodes reliably identifies around 30% of node positive patients. Intraoperative assessment of the SLN using frozen section or real time molecular assays enables surgeons to perform one stage ALND in node positive patients. For those patients in whom intra-operative SLN assessment is negative, but whose final pathology reveals SLN metastasis, standard treatment has been to perform a completion ALND. Predictive models can be used to identify a lowrisk group of SLN-positive patients in whom routine ALND may not be necessary. In the future, completion ALND for microscopic disease will not be the standard of care but axillary radiotherapy may be an alternative with equal control and less morbidity.",eng,0

However, many women who are candidates for BCT either choose mastectomy or lumpectomy alone for myriad reasons. Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) is a collection of radiotherapy techniques that deliver higher daily doses of radiation to the surgical cavity with margin over a shorter time than WBI, reducing total treatment time from 6-6.5 weeks to 1-2 weeks. Advocates of APBI state that early results of this approach demonstrate excellent local control, minimal acute toxicity, and are associated with more convenience for the patient. Phase III randomized clinical trials are currently underway to assess local control, acute and chronic toxicities, and quality of life associated with APBI compared to WBI. In this review, we hope to clarify the rationale behind APBI and discuss in depth data concerning various partial-breast irradiation techniques that are being used throughout the United States and around the world.",,0

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data on 1521 orthopaedic oncologic surgical procedures in 1304 patients. We assessed patient demographics, updated Charlson comorbidity index, surgery-specific data, and treatment-related data and attempted to identify predictors of surgical site infection with bivariate and multivariable analysis. Results: Eight factors independently predicted surgical site infection: body mass index (odds ratio [OR]:, 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00 to 1.07), age (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.33), total number of preceding procedures (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.34), preexisting implants (OR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3.21), infection at another site on the date of the surgery (OR: 4.13, 95% CI: 1.57 to 10.85), malignant disease (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 0.94 to 2.26), hip region affected (OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.35 to 2.84), and duration of the procedure (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.25). Conclusions: These factors can inform patients and surgeons of the probability of surgical site infection after orthopaedic oncologic surgery. While most risk factors are unmodifiable or related to the complexity of the case, infection at another site on the date of the surgery is one factor amenable to intervention.

Yashar,2010.0,Comparison of target breast volume treated for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) devices,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&AN=70277585","Purpose/Objective(s): The Strut Adjusted Volume Implant, SAVI, is a multi-catheter, single entry brachytherapy device for APBI designed for adaptability to anatomic constraints. There are four sizes with 6, 8, or 10 peripheral struts available for source dwell positions providing excellent dosing flexibility. Since the sizes were designed to fit multiple cavity sizes, a study was undertaken to evaluate the amount of target breast tissue treated with each device, and compare that to published data for other available devices. Materials/Methods: A retrospective review of 67 patients treated at the University of California San Diego was undertaken to evaluate the size of the treated target breast tissue. Mean sizes and ranges of the PTV-eval (1 cm expansion of the cavity excluding the cavity volume 5mm below the skin, and chest wall) were evaluated for each SAVI size. The data was further subdivided into patients with no normal tissue restrictions on the PTV-eval, and those with chestwall and/or skin restrictions, limiting the size and shape of the PTV-eval. Results: A symmetrical expansion of 1 cm from the 6, 8 and 10 SAVI would give ideal PTV-evals of approximately 59, 74, and 110cc. In this patient population, the 6 mini, 6, 8, and 10 strut device treated a mean and SD (with range in parentheses) of 45.2 +/- 6 cc (37.9-53.9 cc), 47.6 +/- 11 cc (23.2-65.9 cc), 71.9 +/- 17 cc (40.5-105.1 cc), and 89.3 +/- 22 cc (62-133.1 cc). Review of the data confirms that proximity to the skin, chestwall, or both reduced the PTV-eval. Published data on the Contura catheter demonstrates a mean PTV-eval of 89.7 cc (71.9-108.9 cc) and 94.9 +/- 12 cc (74.4-119.8) for the Mammosite. Of the patients treated with the 6 mini or 6 SAVI, 86% had the PTV-eval reduced secondary to either proximity of skin or chestwall. Of all patients treated, 48% had skin bridges less than 7 mm, 30% less than 5 mm, and 15% less than 3 mm. Dosimetry for the entire cohort demonstrated a V90% (volume receiving 90% of the dose) of 96%, V150 and V200 (volume of tissue receiving 150 and 200% of the dose, respectively) of 27 and 13 cc. Conclusions: As expected, the size of the PTV-eval increases with size of SAVI catheter device. In this study, the 8 strut and especially the 10 strut device can treat an equivalent PTV-eval size well within the ranges published for MammoSite and Contura. The 6 mini device and 6 device, while treating less normal tissue, was usually chosen secondary to normal tissue proximity restrictions, limiting the amount of target tissue desirable to treat. In fact, many of these patients would not be eligible for balloon brachytherapy only based on skin proximity of <5mm and <3 mm, and disregarding chestwall proximity.",,0

To evaluate how these changes may affect the field of radiation oncology, we evaluated the association of insurance status with the use of brachytherapy in cancers for which this treatment technique is used. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 190,467 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 95,292 (50.0%) had breast cancer, 61,096 (32.1%) had prostate cancer, 28,194 (14.8%) had endometrial cancer, and 5885 (3.1%) had cervical cancer. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the association between insurance status and receipt of brachytherapy among patients treated definitively for prostate and cervical cancer or postoperatively for breast and endometrial cancer. RESULTS: The rates of non-Medicaid insurance were 49.9% (cervical), 85.3% (endometrial), 87.4% (breast), and 90.9% (prostate) (P<.001). In a logistic regression, patients who received radiation therapy were less likely to receive brachytherapy if they had Medicaid coverage (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.61, P<.001) or did not have insurance coverage (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.45-0.56, P<.001) compared with those with non-Medicaid insurance. On subset analysis, patients with Medicaid coverage or without insurance coverage were significantly less likely to receive brachytherapy than were those with non-Medicaid insurance for all 4 sites, except for patients with endometrial cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being a cost-effective treatment modality, brachytherapy is less often used in the definitive or postoperative management of cancer in patients with Medicaid coverage or without insurance. Upcoming health policy changes resulting in the expansion of private insurance and Medicaid will likely increase access to and demand for brachytherapy.",eng,0

Preoperative imaging of the abdominal vasculature allows for preoperative perforator selection, resulting in improved operative efficiency and flap design. Abdominal wall perforators of 1-mm diameter can be reliably visualized without exposing patients to ionizing radiation or iodinated intravenous contrast through advances in magnetic resonance imaging angiography (MRA). In this study, MRA imaging was performed on 31 patients who underwent 50 abdominal flaps. For each flap, the location, relative to the umbilicus, of the three largest perforators on both the left and right sides of the abdomen was determined with MRA. Vessel diameter and anatomic course were also evaluated. Postoperatively, a survey was completed by the surgeon to assess the accuracy of the MRA with respect to the intraoperative findings. All perforators visualized on MRA were found at surgery (0% false-positive). In 2 of 50 flaps, the surgeon transferred a flap based upon a vessel not visualized on the MRA (4% false-negative).

Patient selection criteria and method of margin assessment are not clearly established. The aim of our review was to analyse oncological and aesthetic outcomes over a 7 year period. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 251 breast cancer patients who underwent TM from 2002 to 2009 at the Netcare Breast Care Centre, Johannesburg. Primary chemotherapy was used to downsize large tumours. Intraoperative margin assessment was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Cosmetic outcomes were assessed by an independent review panel using photographic material. RESULTS: Mean tumour size was 15.4 mm. Mean resection weight was 237 g. Sixty-four (25.5 %) patients received primary chemotherapy. Mean margin taken was 15 mm. The back-to-theatre rate was 2 % (5 cases). A total of 222 patients underwent bilateral procedures. Contralateral occult disease was identified in six cases (2.4 %). The early (<2 months) complication rate was 3.2 %. Late complications were related to adjuvant radiotherapy (20.7 %). Mean follow-up was 50 months. The recurrence rate was 4 %. Five of six patients with locoregional recurrence had DCIS at initial surgery. The mortality rate was 3.2 %. The overall survival rate was 96.4 % and the metastasis-free survival rate was 94.6 %. Acceptable aesthetic results were achieved in 96 % of the patients.

Materials: Since May 2006, 226 patients have been treated with IORT for breast cancer. IORT was performed by means of a dedicated linac (Mobetron, IntraOp, California) provided with four electron energies (4, 6, 9, 12 MeV) in a dedicated and shielded operating room. The dose prescription was 21 Gy at the point of maximum dose.During the first two years we performed in vivo dosimetry in 40 patients with micromosfet detectors (TN502-RDM, Thomson & Nielsen), and we recently introduced measurements by means of radiochromic films (Gafchromic MD55-V2, ISP inc.), performed so far in ten patients. We put the film under the mammary gland that constitutes the target volume: this position allowed us to verify that the whole target volume was included in the reference isodose curve. Results: In general we found an important inhomogeneity of the dose distribution, consistent with a significant variability of the target thickness.For every patient we analyzed the maximum, minimum and mean dose.Considering all the patients we found a mean maximum dose of 21.4 Gy (with SD of 6%) and a mean minimum dose of 16.2 Gy (with SD of 8%).We also found that: - the maximum dose might exceed the prescription dose, possibly because of the irradiation geometry;- the minimum dose might be lower than the required 80% prescription dose, which entails underdosage of the target volume that might be due to inaccurate measurement of the thickness;- the minimum dose might be higher than the expected 80% prescription dose;- the mean dose for each patient is satisfactorily similar to the expected value. Conclusions: Radiochromic dosimetry presents many pros versus mosfet dosimetry:- it provides 2D information and not just a point-like information;- it offers simplicity of handling (a radiochromic film is simpler to position than a micromosfet, that we used to sew to the exposed tissues);- it doesn't need cables, which means no need for sterile catheters and no electrometer to be connected in a sterile environment.An obvious disadvantage is to have a response after many hours from treatment (at least 24h in our protocol).In vivo dosimetry is particularly important, especially in IORT radical treatments because the whole dose is delivered in a single session. The use of ra- diochromic films implies only an observation of the outcome of the single treatment and it's not intended to take a level of action, however by looking at general results this dosimetric verification might show the need to improve the procedure.Up to now, our results show us that the measured dose is satisfactorily similar to the expected distribution.",,0

We analysed our experience on the technical aspects of this innovative approach in terms of identification of breast volume actually to be treated during IORT. Patients and Methods: A total of 315 patients at low risk of breast cancer recurrence underwent IORT as exclusive treatment after breastconservative surgery. To evaluate the breast volume actually irradiated with IORT, we considered a sample of eight patients, chosen retrospectively as having enough clips to identify the tumour bed and IORT site in computedtomography (CT). The clinical target volume (CTV) was assessed for each patient with two different methods: the first, cc-IORT, was considered during surgery according to the chosen collimator diameter and glandular thickness, while the second, cc-CT, was evaluated through computedtomography performed after surgery. The cc-CT CTV was obtained by contouring the cc-IORT on the CT section on the basis of the clips placed by the surgeon on the resection margins. Results: In our experience, the 5-cm (50%) and the 6-cm (36%) diameter collimators have been the ones, used the most. The diameter of the collimator used did not appear to adversely affect the satisfactory aesthetic result. The comparison between CTVs showed that glandular breast volume contoured with CT (cc-CT) appeared to be three fold larger than the target identified at surgery and included in the area of chosen collimator (cc-IORT). Conclusion: The actual volume of breast gland irradiated with the IORT procedure appears to be larger than expected.

This suggests that the radiation dose could be delivered exclusively to the tumor bed, allowing larger fractions to be used without increasing toxicity and shortening the total treatment time. We investigated the use of the MammoSite irradiation system with a view to analyzing complications, cosmesis and patient comfort. Between 2004 and 2007 intracavity brachytherapy was given to 30 patients using the MammoSite device. The reference isodose was prescribed to the lumpectomy cavity with a 1 cm margin. Geometric parameters and anatomic position of the applicator after implantation were checked via CT, x-ray and ultrasound. Analysis was done for patient quality of life, cosmesis, early and late complications. Forty-nine patients received a proposal for MammoSite brachytherapy. Nine declined, 40 enrolled while 10 were excluded for various reasons (Table 5). A total of 30 patients were actually treated to 34 Gy (2 x 3.4 Gy) in 5 days. We observed 3 cases (10%) of infection within 3 months of implantation. Symptomatic seroma was seen in five patients (16.6%) at 6 months, in three (10%) at 12 months, and in just one patient (3.3%) at 18 months. Good to excellent cosmetic results were achieved in 75% by patient and physician ratings. Accelerated partial breast irradiation using the MammoSite catheter produces favorable short-term outcomes, limited toxic effects on skin, and optimal cosmetic results. Patient tolerance for the treatment is very high. Critical issues may regard the importance of good cavity conformance and adequate balloon-skin distance in avoiding possible dose excesses to the skin. For a selected patient group, this could be a valid alternative to conventional whole breast irradiation.",eng,0

Materials/Methods: The MC method is known to accurately calculate dose distributions but computational may limit their clinical use. In this work the existing Dose Planning Method is recoded in C++ and optimized for parallel execution in Windows based multi-core platforms, with no change in the physics modeling. Parallelization at the particle level with Windows native threads is straightforward. Read only data structures are shared among threads, to reduce memory footprint and increase cache hits, while dose volumes are per thread to avoid access contention. Particles are created on-line, based on tabulated phase spaces. These have been computed for energies between 6 and 20 MeVs and applicator diameters between 5 and 9 cm using a maximum likelihood iterative algorithm that estimates particle distributions, based on water measurements. The actual clinical setup for IOERT is considered to evaluate the kernel. Phase space characterization and dose distributions correspond with experimental measurements from a commercial linear accelerator. Results: Execution time to meet a target uncertainty grows with energy and applicator section. Performance improvements of MC codes by threading into multiple cores strongly depend on the memory architecture. Simulations for 1x1x1 mm3 water phantoms were run in an Intel i7-870 with every combination of applicator diameter and energy, with an excellent agreement in the mean energy and build up regions. Computation time for a 4% uncertainty ranges from 1' (5 cm/6MeVs) to 12' (9 cm/ 20MeVs). Dose computation in the breast, where radiation penetration is limited by protection, is executed in around a minute. Conclusions: The implemented code allows for clinically relevant dose computations within a reasonable time. The tool narrows the gap between external and intraoperative radiation therapy, enabling radiation oncologists to plan treatment for the possible scenarios he may face.",,0

The MC method that was implemented, which has been integrated into a specific innovative simulation and planning tool, is able to simulate the fate of thousands of particles per second, and it was the aim of this work to determine the level of interactivity that could be achieved. The planning workflow enabled calibration of the imaging and treatment equipment, as well as manipulation of the surgical frame and insertion of the protection shields around the organs at risk and other beam modifiers. In this way, the multidisciplinary team involved in IOERT has all the tools necessary to perform complex MC dosage simulations adapted to their equipment in an efficient and transparent way. To assess the accuracy and reliability of this MC technique, dose distributions for a monoenergetic source were compared with those obtained using a general-purpose software package used widely in medical physics applications. Once accuracy of the underlying simulator was confirmed, a clinical accelerator was modelled and experimental measurements in water were conducted. A comparison was made with the output from the simulator to identify the conditions under which accurate dose estimations could be obtained in less than 3 min, which is the threshold imposed to allow for interactive use of the tool in treatment planning. Finally, a clinically relevant scenario, namely early-stage breast cancer treatment, was simulated with pre- and intraoperative volumes to verify that it was feasible to use the MC tool intraoperatively and to adjust dose delivery based on the simulation output, without compromising accuracy. The workflow provided a satisfactory model of the treatment head and the imaging system, enabling proper configuration of the treatment planning system and providing good accuracy in the dosage simulation.",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1999 and 2007, 167 patients between the ages of 26 and 45 years old (72 were 40 years old or younger), with stages T1 to T2 invasive breast cancer with disease-free margin status of at least 5 mm after breast-conserving surgery received 46 to 50 Gy whole-breast irradiation plus a 7-Gy HDR-BT boost (fast boost""). An axillary dissection was performed in 72.5% of the patients and sentinel lymph node biopsy in 27.5%. A supraclavicular area was irradiated in 19% of the patients. Chemotherapy was used in 86% of the patients and hormone treatment in 77%. Clinical nodes were present in 18% and pathological nodes in 29%. The pathological stage was pT0: 5%, pTis: 3%, pT1: 69% and pT2: 23%. Intraductal component was present in 40% and 28% were G3. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 92 months, 9 patients relapsed on the margin of the implant, and 1 patient in another quadrant, resulting in a 10-year local relapse rate of 4.3% and a breast relapse rate of 4.9%, with breast preservation in 93.4%; no case of mastectomy due to poor cosmesis arose. Actuarial 5- and 10-year disease-free, cause-specific, and overall survival rates were 87.9% and 85.8%, and 92.1% and 88.4%, and 92.1% and 87.3%, respectively. In a univariate analysis, triple-negative cases and negative hormone receptors did worse, but in a multivariate analysis, only the last factor was significant for local and breast control. Asymptomatic fibrosis G2 was recorded in 3 cases, and there were no other late complications. Cosmetic results were good to excellent in 97% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of 7 Gy using the fast-boost technique is well tolerated, with a low rate of late complications and improved local tumor control in women aged 45 and younger, compared to published data. This approach is recommended in breast-preserving treatment.""",eng,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients who were suitable for IObRT were identified within the group of patients who were selected for breast conserving surgery at our breast council. A MOBETRON (mobile linear accelerator for IObRT) was used for IObRt during surgery. RESULTS: Patients younger than 60 years old with <3 cm invasive ductal cancer in one focus (or two foci within 2 cm), with a histologic grade of 2-3, and a high possibility of local recurrence were admitted for IObRT application. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed and advancement flaps were prepared according to the size and inclination of the conus following evaluation of tumor size and surgical margins by pathology. Distance to the thoracic wall was measured, and a radiation oncologist and radiation physicist calculated the required dose. Anesthesia was regulated with slower ventilation frequency, without causing hypoxia. The skin and incision edges were protected, the field was radiated (with 6 MeV electron beam of 10 Gy) and the incision was closed. In our cases, there were no major postoperative surgical or early radiotherapy related complications. CONCLUSION: The completion of another stage of local therapy with IObRT during surgery positively effects sequencing of other treatments like chemotherapy, hormonotherapy and radiotherapy, if required. IObRT increases disease free and overall survival, as well as quality of life in breast cancer patients.",eng,0

To demonstrate DMR, RGD (integrin binding) and RAD (control) probes were synthesized bearing DOTA (for (111) In(3+)), a NIR fluorochrome, and 5 kDa PEG that endows probes with a protein-like volume of 25 kDa and decreases non-specific interactions. With a GFP-BT-20 breast carcinoma model, tumor targeting by the DMR or i.v. methods was assessed by surface fluorescence, biodistribution of [(111)In] RGD and [(111)In] RAD probes, and whole animal SPECT. After a PT injection, both probes rapidly diffused through the normal and tumor interstitium, with retention of the RGD probe due to integrin interactions. With PT injection and the [(111)In] RGD probe, SPECT indicated a highly tumor specific uptake at 24 h post injection, with 352%ID/g tumor obtained by DMR (vs 4.14%ID/g by i.v.). The high efficiency molecular targeting of DMR employed low probe doses (e.g. 25 ng as RGD peptide), which minimizes toxicity risks and facilitates clinical translation. DMR applications include the delivery of fluorochromes for intraoperative tumor margin delineation, the delivery of radioisotopes (e.g. toxic, short range alpha emitters) for radiotherapy, or the delivery of photosensitizers to tumors accessible to light.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIAL: Ninety-two patients with histologically proven stage 0-II breast cancer were treated with MammoSite accelerated partial breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery. The catheter was placed at the time of surgery or postoperatively. Treatment prescription was 3.4Gy b.i.d. for a period of five days using high-dose-rate afterloading. Clinical and dosimetric parameters including dose to 90% of PTV, volume of PTV receiving 100% of dose, volume of PTV receiving 150% of dose, edited PTV, and dose homogeneity index were analyzed as variables correlating with late effects. RESULTS: All patients received the prescribed treatment. Seventy-seven percent of patients had intraoperative catheter placement, which was associated with a higher rate of persistent seroma (79%). The presence of seroma did not affect cosmesis. Ten patients developed telangiectasia at a median of 20.5 months. Skin dose and balloon-to-skin distance had a significant correlation with the development of telangiectasia that significantly affected cosmetic grading. The telangiectasia incidence for maximum skin dose of >100% and >125% of the prescription dose were 28% and 63%, compared with 0% (p=0.0001) and 4.2% (p=0.0001) for doses of < or =100% and < or =125%, respectively. Overall, most patients had excellent cosmetic results, and local control of disease was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: MammoSite radiation therapy system demonstrates excellent local control and cosmetic outcome with extended followup. The maximum skin dose should be kept below 100% to reduce late effects on skin and improve cosmetic outcome. The persistence of seroma is higher with intraoperative placement of the catheter, and therefore postoperative placement is preferred.",eng,0
Journal Article,J. Hammer; J. J. Mazeron; E. Van Limbergen,1999.0,"Breast boost--why, how, when...?",", ","BACKGROUND: Breast conservation management including tumorectomy or quadrantectomy and external beam radiotherapy with a dose of 45 to 50 Gy in the treatment of small breast carcinomas is generally accepted. The use of a radiation boost--in particular for specific subgroups--has not been clarified. With regard to the boost technique there is some controversy between groups emphasizing the value of electron boost treatment and groups pointing out the value of interstitial boost treatment. This controversy has become even more complicated as there is an increasing number of institutions reporting the use of HDR interstitial brachytherapy for boost treatment. The most critical issue with regard to interstitial HDR brachytherapy is the assumed serious long-term morbidity after a high single radiation dose as used in HDR-treatments. METHODS AND RESULTS: This article gives a perspective and recommendations on some aspects of this issue (indication, timing, target volume, dose and dose rate). CONCLUSION: More information about the indication for a boost is to be expected from the EORTC trial 22881/10882. Careful selection of treatment procedures for specific subgroups of patients and refinement in surgical procedures and radiotherapy techniques may be useful in improving the clinical and cosmetic results in breast conservation therapy. Prospective trials comparing on the one hand different boost techniques and on the other hand particular morphologic criteria in treatments with boost and without boost are needed to give more detailed recommendations for boost indications and for boost techniques.",eng,0

The final results of the NSABP B-32 trial were presented, which confirmed the equivalent safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) compared to axillary node dissection. These surprising results of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial could influence the standard of care because they do not support routine axillary node dissection in the case of positive SLNB. Additionally, it could be shown that the presence of micrometastatic lymphatic disease as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry alone does not have a prognostic impact. Intraoperative radiotherapy may be a new option in radiotherapy because of its low toxicity rate and comparable local control at 24 months' follow-up based on the results of the randomized TARGIT trial. Moreover the CACGB 9343 trial only showed a small benefit of radiotherapy in elderly patients (> 70 years) after breast conserving therapy. The pooled data analysis of the BRITS and DESTINY trials revealed a therapeutically highly relevant rate of receptor discordance in the metastatic setting. However, use of the multityrosinkinase inhibitor sunitinib in combination with capecitabine or docetaxel was disappointing. In contrast a large meta-analysis confirmed the positive impact of bevacizumab on progression-free survival (PFS). The new molecular therapeutics such as PARP inhibitors and T-DM1 will have to be investigated in more detail. In gynecological carcinomas there was finally a trend towards targeted therapies. A significantly better PFSwas reported for primary ovarian cancer after maintenance therapy with bevacizumab compared to the standard therapy. Moreover the combination of carboplatin with PLD or gemcitabine might represent an alternative regimen in first-line treatment. New and promising substances such as PARP inhibitors, peptibodies and immunocon-jugate drugs are currently being tested for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. The use of new sequential radiochemotherapies and antiangiogenetic agents has shown encouraging results in the treatment of cervical and endometrial cancer. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.",,0

To address this issue, we compared tissue expansion properties, complication rates, and patient satisfaction for both operative techniques at the same institution. A retrospective review was completed on 75 patients and 100 tissue expander/implant-based breast reconstructions at a single academic institution from 2007 to 2010. Of these cases, 31 patients were reconstructed with ADM and 44 with a submuscular coverage technique. Total complications including seroma, hematoma, infection, skin necrosis, and explantation did not significantly differ between groups (n = 13 for ADM vs. 17 for submuscular, P = 0.814). Consistent with prior reports, ADM-based reconstructions were associated with significantly increased intraoperative fill volumes and lower total number of sessions to achieve final volume. Submuscular reconstructions required a significantly higher tissue expander fill volume. Eight patients in the submuscular group required surgical revision of the breast and inframammary fold, compared with 4 in the ADM group; however, this difference was not significant. Patient satisfaction was equivalent between the 2 groups; however, it was higher in patients with bilateral reconstruction and lower among those who had received adjuvant radiation therapy. Satisfaction with nipple reconstruction was inversely proportional to time elapsed from the procedure to survey conduction. This is the first study to perform a head-to-head comparison on the basis of patient satisfaction, the results of which may be useful in preoperative planning and counseling.",eng,0

Materials and Methods: Between May 2012 and May 2013, seventy-eight patients were enrolled by twelve US hospitals. Upon meeting the inclusion/ exclusion criteria, patients underwent partial mastectomy. While in the operating room, a balloon applicator suitable to the surgical bed was placed in the lumpectomy cavity and inflated with saline (30 - 75 cc). The skin was temporarily closed over the balloon and ultrasound examination performed to confirm that the balloon surface-to-skin distance was > 1.0 cm. A single fraction of intra-operative radiation therapy was delivered to the lumpectomy cavity using the Xoft System. The prescribed dose was 20 Gy at the balloon applicator surface, and the mean treatment time was 10.5 minutes. After treatment, the balloon was deflated and removed, and skin sutured. Results: Seventy-seven patients received the prescribed dose of 20 Gy; one subject received 21 Gy. Eleven (11) patients were removed from the primary analysis post-IORT due to positive surgical margins (N=3), positive sentinel lymph nodes (N=2), balloon surface-to-skin distance < 1 cm (N=1), tumor size > 3 cm (N=3), and invasive lobular carcinoma (N=2). However, these eleven subjects will continue to be followed for the duration of this 10-year study. Fifty-three (53) of the sixty-seven (67) evaluable patients had a minimum follow-up of 12 months (median follow-up 412 days). The mean patient age was 65 years (43-89). Ten patients (15%) had ductal carcinoma in situ, fifty-five (82%) had invasive ductal carcinoma, and two (3%) had unknown histology. The DCIS nuclear grade was evenly distributed between high (N=5) and low/ intermediate (N=5). Invasive cancer was Grade 1-2 in 45/55 cases. Sixtyfour patients (95.5%) had T1 lesions, two (3%) had T2 lesions, and one (1.5%) was unknown. The mean tumor size was 11.0 mm +/- 5.7 mm. At twelve months, only 17/100 adverse events were Grade 2 or higher, and only 4/100 were serious (death due to aortic injury, malignant neoplasm [ovarian cancer], nausea, and death of unknown cause. The most frequent side effects were erythema (17.1%), ecchymosis (15.7%), and seroma (12.8%). Cosmesis was excellent to good in 94% of cases. Conclusions: IORT using the Xoft System as part of the conservative treatment of breast cancer is safe, with low morbidity. Early results from this multi-center trial demonstrate this short, convenient course of radiation therapy for select patients with early stage breast cancer has excellent-to-good cosmetic results and a low rate of low-grade adverse events.",,0

OBJECTIVES: To analyze early and late complications, cosmetic satisfaction of patients, and recurrence rates. METHODS: Patients with the following characteristics were included: invasive breast ductal carcinoma, local staging with mammogram, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging showing uni-central and uni-focal tumor, age>40 years, T1N0. The procedure is done according to the following steps on table 1: RESULTS: Initially 194 patients were included, but due to intraoperative exclusion criteria (positive sentinel lymph nodes or margins), 159 were analyzed. The median age was 57.9 (40 to 85.4) years and the median follow-up was 56.6 (1 to 103.2) months. Seven patients recurred (4 local and 3 regional). The average estimates for overall and event-free survival were respectively 95.4 (CI 95% 93.1-97.6) months and 90.1 (CI 95% 85.8-94.5) months. The crude incidences for acute (up to one month after surgery) and late (after one month) toxicities were respectively 8.2% and 26.2%. Excellent, good, fair and bad cosmetic outcomes (Harvard/NSABP/RT OG scale) were observed in 70.9%, 14.2%, 3.7% and 3.0%, respectively. Collimator sizes were 4cm in 18.7%, 5cm in 80.6%, and 7cm in 0.7% of cases. The electron energy chosen for treatment was 6MeV in 7.4%, 9MeV in 52.2%, 12MeV in 35.8%, 15MeV in 3.7% and 18MeV in 0.7%. The alignment between the shield and the collimator was appropriate in 72.4% (27.6% of patients required repositioning). No infection cases were related to peri-hospitalar time. CONCLUSIONS: IORT using NDLA has shown low toxicity profile, high favorable aesthetics outcomes, and good oncologic efficacy. The use of NDLA may be usefull in settings without dedicated equipment for breast IORT.",,0

Methods: Prospective phaseII trial opened in May 2004. Eligibility criteria: single-focal breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma, age >40 years, size <3cm (after February 2009 >50 years and <2cm) and cN0. Exclusion criteria: carcinoma in situ or lobular types, impossibility of breast-conserving surgery, metastasis or another cancer. Patients underwent classic quadrantectomy with intraoperative margins and SLN evaluation. If both negative, IORT was prescribed (21Gy). Adjuvant treatment considered after definitive pathology report. Endpoints: oncologic, toxicity, aesthetics, and technical issues. Results: From May/2004 to May/2010, 161 patients were enrolled (intention-to-treat analysis) and 34 were excluded. Thus, 127 patients were analyzed. Oncologic analysis involved patients with follow-up >24 months (n=83) or breast events. Median age was 56 (40-86) years and median follow-up was 43 (24-72) months. The table summarizes all findings. Conclusions: Single-dose breast IORT presents early oncologic, toxicity, and aesthetic results similar to previously reported trials. Nondedicated facilities have advantages: lower costs; allow higher electron energies; and portal film imaging before treatments. Long-term results will be necessary to strength this data.

Figl,2011.0,Second conservative treatment for ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence using high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy: preliminary clinical results and evaluation of patient satisfaction,10.1016/j.brachy.2010.05.004,"PURPOSE: To assess early clinical results and evaluate patient satisfaction in case of second conservative treatment (2nd CT) combining lumpectomy plus high-dose rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy for patients (pts) presenting with ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence (IBCR). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 2005 to July 2009, 42 pts presenting with an IBCR underwent a second lumpectomy with intraoperative implantation of plastic tubes in the tumor bed. After performing the dose distribution analysis on the postimplant CT scan, a total dose of 34 Gy in 10 fractions over 5 consecutive days was delivered. Toxicity evaluation was based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 criteria. Applying a visual analogic scale (VAS) analysis, patient satisfaction regarding cosmetic result and 2nd CT possibility was performed after the end of brachytherapy. RESULTS: Median followup was 21 months (range, 6-50 months) and median age at the time of local recurrence was 65 years (range, 30-85 years). Median delay between primary and recurrence was 11 years (range, 1-35 years). Median recurrence tumor size was 12 mm (range, 2-30 mm). Median number of plastic tubes and planes were nine (range, 5-12) and two (range, 1-3), respectively. Median clinical target volume was 68 cc (range, 31.2-146 cc). Second local control rate was 97%. Twenty-two pts (60%) developed complications. Cutaneous and subcutaneous fibrosis was the most frequent side effect. Median VAS satisfaction score regarding cosmetic result was 7 of 10 (range, 4-9), whereas median VAS satisfaction score for 2nd CT was 10 of 10 (range, 8-10). CONCLUSION: A 2nd CT for IBCR using high-dose rate brachytherapy seems feasible with encouraging results in terms of second local control with an acceptable toxicity. Patient satisfaction regarding the possibility of second breast preservation should be considered.",eng,0

This study presents the preliminary clinical and dosimetric results of the APBI using HDIB, performed in Antoine Lacassagne Cancer Center of Nice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 2004 to March 2008, 61 patients (37 primary tumors and 24 second conservative treatments after local recurrence) presenting with T1-2 pN0 non-lobular invasive breast carcinoma, underwent lumpectomy with sentinel lymph node dissection and intraoperative tube placement for HDIB. Dose distribution analysis, using dose-volume histograms, was achieved based on a postoperative CT scan. A comparative dosimetric study was performed between optimized (O) and non-optimized (NO) dose distribution. Then, based on conformal index calculation, a novel index was proposed taking into account not only the conformity but also the homogeneity of HDIB implant. An analysis of dose gradient impact on HDIB biological equivalence dose was also conducted. Statistical analysis used T test confirmed by Wilcoxon test for cohort including less than 30 patients. RESULTS: The comparative dosimetric analysis between O and NO dose distributions shown that conformity indexes (conformal index, conformal number, and D90%) were significantly increased after optimization. Improving conformity leads to increasing hyperdosage volumes (V150% and V200%). A new index named conformity and homogeneity index (CHI) including V150% values, modified the conformal index. A total dose of 34 Gy, delivered through HDIB in 10 fractions over five days was biologically equivalent to 41.93 Gy assuming alpha/beta = 4 Gy and 75.76 Gy if the dose gradient was considered in the calculation. CONCLUSIONS: HDIB is considered as one of the best IPAS technique. HDIB allows dose distribution optimization, skin spearing and accurate clinical target volume definition. Furthermore, HDIB dose gradient could play a key role for breast cancer local control.",fre,0

Thomas Hartigan (Blackfriars Hospital, London) used Radium radioactive sources as contact therapy"" for breast cancer. In 1924, Geoffrey Keynes proposed to use radium by interstitial implantation. By 1937, Keynes had performed 325 breast implants and was able to statistically demonstrate equivalent 5-year survival to radical mastectomy [1]. Nowadays, brachytherapy represents the smartest way to deliver a high dose in a small volume especially in case of breast cancer which is well known to be highly sensitive to dose escalation [2]. Currently we have to deal with new radiation therapy technologies from external beam to intraoperative going through new brachytherapy devices. New challenges for radiation oncologists are to use the right radiation technique for the right patient in order to achieve the best clinical outcome. For brachytherapy, achieving local control remains a key objective but it should be obtain with a low rate of side effects and this concept appears strongly correlated with the respect of certain rules of vectors implantation, dose distribution constrains and target delineation. Whatever the indication, breast brachytherapy represents a partial irradiation of the breast. This partial breast irradiation (PBI) can be performed using historically interstitial multicatheter implants with plastic tubes or needles. In such situation, any type of dose rate can be used (low, pulsed or high) [3]. Seed implants represent another more recent technical approach for breast interstitial brachytherapy mainly used for accelerated PBI (APBI) [4]. Beside interstitial technique, balloon system represents another approach. Initially based on single catheter design [5], the balloon technique improved by using a multi catheter concept leading to better dose distribution [6]. In the future, electronic brachytherapy could be also used in some indications [7] While boost after whole breast post-operative irradiation has been the main brachytherapy indication, during the two last decades [8], breast brachytherapy appeared more and more attractive in other situations such accelerated and partial breast irradiation as sole therapy [9] and for second conservative treatment in case of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence [10]. Last but not least, beside technological and medico-economic constraints, radiation oncology community has to face to methodological and statistic developments. In the frame of Evidence Based Medicine, clinical research represents the main asset to progress and propose validated treatments as brachytherapy for breast cancer. However, is it still possible to continue to wait 10 to 15 years after the inclusion of thousands of patients and the expense of thousands (millions) of dollars/euros? Is the ""overall survival"" always the smartest primary endpoint? What could be the next step in terms of clinical research for the promotion of breast brachytherapy? In this frame, a good example we have probably to mimic is represented by the EMBRACE study. This pragmatic international study started as a retrospective one and rapidly evolved as a prospective observatory data base. GEC-ESTRO Gynecologic group is now able to give strong clinical evidences to promote brachytherapy without any phase III randomized trials. Breast brachytherapy keeps going with new fractionation, new technical devices and probably new indications. The international community of radiation oncologist involved in breast brachytherapy has to continue to push forward with clinical research, teaching and reimbursement challenges.""",,0

For breast cancer, BT is usually used as boost after postoperative external beam radiation therapy. In certain circumstances, BT can be used as sole radiation technique focalized on the tumor bed or more rarely, as second conservative treatment in case of local recurrence for woman refusing salvage mastectomy. Boost BT is most often applied via an interstitial technique while the dose rate can vary from low to high dose rate through pulse dose rate. All of those boost techniques were published and some of them compared the results obtained with BT and external beam electron therapy. The analysis of the published phase II and III trials was not able to show significant differences between the two boost techniques in term of local control as well as late skin side effects. However, we noted that the patients who received BT boost presented a higher risk of local recurrence compare to those treated with electron therapy, due to age, margin status or presence of extensive intraductal component. Only a phase III trial randomizing BT boost vs electron therapy boost could show a possible improvement of local control rate in the BT arm; however, this trial should enroll patients with a real high risk of local recurrence in order to take benefit from the dosimetric advantages of BT.",fre,0

Ten to fifteen years have been needed to change from the standard"" to the ""new"" breast cancer treatment. At the end of the 1990s, a few authors published preliminary results of phase II trials using partial breast irradiation (PBI) as sole post-operative treatment based on interstitial low or high dose rate brachytherapy techniques. Currently, phase III randomized trials comparing whole breast irradiation versus PBI are ongoing in the USA and in EU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors reviewed the literature regarding issues in the irradiation of breast cancer and the potential role of PBI to prevent local recurrence in the ipsilateral breast. Furthermore, potential advantages of PBI were discussed as well as the limits of such a procedure. Finally, we tried to determine the characteristics of a subgroup of patients who would receive benefit from this radiation technique. RESULTS: Phase II and III trials have been analyzed concerning feasibility, efficacy and toxicity. PBI may be delivered through low or high dose rate brachytherapy or intraoperative/external beam radiation therapy. PBI satisfies the control quality criteria. The majority of the teams provide PBI recurrence rates lower than 5% (0-4.4%) with a median follow-up varying between 8 and 72 months, and associated with cosmetic results comparable to those achieved with conventional external beam. CONCLUSION: RSCT does not replace mastectomy; mastectomy and RSCT are used together to treat different subgroups of patients. PBI furnished encouraging preliminary results in terms of local control and cosmetic results. However, caution in interpreting the results is required along with longer follow-up. PBI should not replace CT, but could be considered as a new therapeutic strategy for breast cancer dedicated to a very well defined subgroup of patients with a low risk of local recurrence.""",eng,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 09/00 and 09/10, 217 patients presenting an IBTR underwent lumpectomy and MCB (low, pulsed, or high-dose rate). Survival rates without second local recurrence (2nd LR), distant metastasis (DM), and overall survival (OS) were analysed as well as late effects and cosmetic results. Univariate and multivariate analyses (MVA) based on IBTR data were performed to find prognostic factors for 2nd LR, DM, and OS. RESULTS: Median follow-up after the IBTR was 3.9 years [range: 1.1-10.3]. Five and 10-year actuarial 2nd LR rates were 5.6% [range: 1.5-9.5] and 7.2% [range: 2.1-12.1], respectively. Five and 10-year actuarial DM rates were 9.6% [range: 5.7-15.2] and 19.1% [range: 7.8-28.3], respectively.

STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-two women were enrolled in an extended phase II trial using (125)I-MB to guide SLNB. All patients were anesthetized and then injected subcutaneously with 1 mCi (125)I-MB in the outer quadrant of the areola. RESULTS: Radioactivity was detected in the axilla within 3 to 5 minutes. Fifty-eight of 62 (94%) patients had SLNs detected during their procedure. Mean (+/-SD) number of SLNs per patient was 1.8 +/- 1.3 (range 0 to 6). A total of 112 nodes were dissected from 58 women; 110 of these nodes were considered sentinel. One hundred and eight (98%) nodes were hot, 98 (89%) nodes were blue, and 96 (87%) nodes were both hot and blue. Two women had complications; 1 had superficial skin staining and 1 had a superficial skin slough. Both healed uneventfully. No allergic reactions were observed. No radioactive uptake in the thyroid was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Iodine-125-labeled methylene blue can be mixed and administered in the operating room, improving hospital efficiency. Patient satisfaction is higher with (125)I-MB than with the technetium 99m sulfur colloid procedure because (125)I-MB does not produce localized burning and other adverse reactions associated with the traditional method, and 125I-MB is administered with the patient under anesthesia. Iodine-125 emits a lower-energy gamma ray than technetium 99m, lowering the surgeon's radiation exposure. Iodine-125-labeled methylene blue SLN identification is safe, cost effective, and produces equivalent outcomes compared with the traditional technique, making it an attractive alternative.",eng,0
Journal Article,W. Harms; H. D. Becker; R. Krempien; M. Wannenmacher,2001.0,Contemporary role of modern brachytherapy techniques in the management of malignant thoracic tumors,", ","Sole brachytherapy for carcinoma of the lung is most often performed using high-dose-rate (HDR) remote afterloading equipment, which delivers the treatment within the tracheobronchial tree in an outpatient setting. It provides excellent, rapid palliation in advanced stages, and can also be used selectively for curative intent in early stages. In better-performance patients, fractionated external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is preferred to brachytherapy as an initial treatment because it appears to provide a modest gain in survival, and more sustained palliation. In patients with centrally located tumors and limited extent of disease, the combination of external and endoluminal irradiation enables curative treatment options. Intraoperative brachytherapy may complement standard adjuvant treatment in incompletely resected, unresectable, or medically inoperable patients, and has the potential to improve local control in selected cases. Due to the rarity of the disease, the role of endoluminal brachytherapy in the treatment regimen of tracheal neoplasms is not yet clearly defined. The risk of fatal bleeding after endoluminal brachytherapy appears to be correlated with tumor localization and fraction size, but in the majority of cases fatal bleeds are caused by progression of local disease. The use of a distanceable applicator provides a central positioning of the source, prevents the delivery of high-contact doses to the mucosa, and may reduce toxicity. The standard technique for interstitial brachytherapy after breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant EBRT is the use of low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy, but it may also be applied by means of pulsed-dose-rate (PDR) or HDR techniques. Prospective trials comparing different boost techniques and indications are needed to define more precisely the subgroup of patients who are most suitable for interstitial brachytherapy. Reirradiation of chest wall local recurrences using brachytherapy molds is effective and provides a high local control rate with acceptable toxicity.",eng,0

Conclusions: Patients with isolated in-breast or regional breast cancer recurrences should be treated with curative intent. Mastectomy is the standard of care for patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. In a subset of patients, a second breast conservation followed by partial breast irradiation (PBI) is an appropriate alternative to mastectomy. If a second breast conservation is performed, additional irradiation should be mandatory. The largest reirradiation experience base exists for multicatheter brachytherapy; however, prospective clinical trials are needed to clearly define selection criteria, long-term local control, and toxicity. Following primary mastectomy, patients with resectable locoregional breast cancer recurrences should receive multimodality therapy including systemic therapy, surgery, and radiation +/- hyperthermia. This approach results in high local control rates and long-term survival is achieved in a subset of patients. In radiation-naive patients with unresectable locoregional recurrences, radiation therapy is mandatory. In previously irradiated patients with a high risk of a second local recurrence after surgical resection or in patients with unresectable recurrences, reirradiation should be strongly considered. Indication and dose concepts depend on the time interval to first radiotherapy, presence of late radiation effects, and concurrent or sequential systemic treatment. Combination with hyperthermia can further improve tumor control. In patients with isolated axillary or supraclavicular recurrence, durable disease control is best achieved with multimodality therapy including surgery and radiotherapy. Radiation therapy significantly improves local control and should be applied whenever feasible. Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).""",,0

Debus,2004.0,[Reirradiation of chest wall local recurrences from breast cancer],10.1055/s-2004-820531,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to describe the radio-therapeutic treatment options in previously irradiated patients suffering from breast cancer local recurrences and to review the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Reirradiation of the chest wall can be performed using electron beams or alternatively CLDR/PDR (continuous/pulsed low dose rate) brachytherapy techniques with large skin moulds. With both techniques high doses can be applied to the chest wall while deeper-seated organs (lung, heart) can be spared to a large extent. Electron-beam therapy is readily available and the depth of treatment can be easily controlled by selecting the appropriate energy. The protracted irradiation schedule of CLDR/PDR brachytherapy results due to radiobiological reasons in a broad therapeutic ratio and safe treatment time. RESULTS: In the literature, more than 250 cases being reirradiated for chest wall local recurrences have been published. After retreatment using electron beams complete remissions were obtained in 41-74 % of the patients (brachytherapy 79-82 %). Severe grade IV complications (RTOG/EORTC) occurred in less than 10 % of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: With regard to the limited treatment options reirradiation of chest wall local recurrences resulted in high local control rates while toxicity remained acceptable. These data weaken the radio-therapeutic dogma that reirradiation of the chest wall may not be possible.",ger,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 2002 and March 2003, 37 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma had MammoSite brachytherapy catheters successfully place after lumpectomy by one of four surgeons and were deemed eligible for high-dose-rate brachytherapy. An open technique was used in 32 implants and the scar entry technique was used in 5 implants. Patients had Stage pTis-pT2N1 with negative margins. A dose of 34 Gy was prescribed to 1 cm from the balloon surface using (192)Ir high-dose-rate brachytherapy and was delivered in 10 fractions twice daily. CT was used to confirm that the balloon surface was adherent to the lumpectomy cavity and to measure the balloon surface to skin surface distance. CT images and daily fluoroscopic simulations were used for treatment planning. Patients were assessed for acute toxicity on the day of therapy completion and 4 weeks after therapy by the radiation oncologist. In addition, all available data from radiation, surgical, and medical oncology were retrospectively reviewed for documentation of complications. All patients in this series had a minimal follow-up of 3 months; the mean follow-up for all patients was 7 months. RESULTS: The acute complications were categorized as operative wound complications, infections, skin toxicity, seromas, or catheter failures. Operative wound complications occurred in 3 patients (8%). Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Grade 2 and Grade 3 toxicity occurred in 2 (5.4%) and 1 (2.7%) patient, respectively. Six (16.2%) developed wound infections and 12 (32.4%) seromas. Catheter failures due to leak occurred in 2 patients (5.4%) and rupture in 3 (8%). CONCLUSION: The types of complications in this experience were similar to those in the Phase I trial of the MammoSite brachytherapy applicator. However, catheter failure due to leak occurred in our experience and was not described in the Phase I trial. The incidence of complications was greater in our series than in the Phase I trial; however, differences in toxicity scoring and the length of follow-up between the two series impeded direct comparisons.

The purpose of the study was to develop and implement a method to verify the internal dosimetry of Intrabeam<sup></sup> (Zeiss). Additionally the long-term stability of Intrabeam<sup></sup> was checked for dose and isotropy. For dose to water measurements an Unidos<sup></sup> was combined with a soft jet chamber (TM 23342) which was calibrated in water absorbed dose and as a phantom the type 2962 (PTW Freiburg) was used. RW1 plates were inserted as build up material. The applicators were placed in a bag filled with water to consider the side-scattering. At the surface of the applicator there was a mean difference of 3 percent between the dose to water measurement and the internal dosimetry. The constancy of the dose rate showed a mean deviation of 0.3% at the reference point. The analysis of the dose distribution perpendicular to the applicator axis z (reference z-axis) resulted in a mean deviation of -2.7% (x-direction) and -7,1% (-x-direction) for the x-axis and, respectively -4.1% (y-direction) and -5.3% (-y-direction) for the y-axis. The proposed method is suitable to verify the absolute dose of Intrabeam<sup></sup>. The dose values measured by this method were congruent to the dosimetry of the manufacture (Zeiss). From our point of view it is sufficient to verify the absolute dosimetry only at time of commissioning of the system or in the case of changing the applicator. For the daily routine the check of constancy specified by the manufacture is adequate, because the dose rate is checked on a daily basis. Additionally the test of constancy showed a high long-term stability in terms of dose rate and symmetry. © 2009.",,0

This study consisted of 78 cases with a metastatic brain tumor that were surgically treated between 1986 to 1992. These cases were classified into three groups: patients who underwent surgery without radiotherapy (S: 36 cases), patients who underwent surgery and post operative conventional radiotherapy (S + R: 27 cases), patients who underwent surgery with IOR (S + IOR: 15 cases). Of the 78 cases, 77 involved a total resection, and the remaining case involved a subtotal resection. In the S + R group, a total dose of 40-56.5 Gy (mean 45.6 Gy) was delivered by using a 10 MeV linear accelerator. In the S + IOR group, a total dose of 20- 25 Gy was delivered by using a betatoron. The IOR cone diameter was adjusted to include a 5 mm perimeter of normal brain tissue, and the 80% isodose line was set to penetrate 5-10 mm below the deepest aspect of the tumor. Our analysis revealed that the respective overall local relapsing free rates for the S, S + R and S + IOR groups were: 46.2%, 88.0%, and 79.9% at 6 months; and 36.4%, 70.7%, and 79.9% at 12 months. For the lung cancer cases, the respective values were as follows: 37.5%, 82.6%, and 84.6% at 6 months; 30.2%, 67.6%, and 84.6% at 12 months. Further, no significant differences were seen in local recurrence rates between the S + R and the S + IOR groups. The mean number of hospitalization days in all 3 groups were: 43.0 days, 75.9 days, and 37.4 days, respectively. Thus, the number of hospitalization days in the S + IOR group was half that of the S + R group. Based on these findings, it appears that IOR treatment resulted in as good localized tumor control as is achieved by conventional radiotherapy and that the number of days of hospitalization is shortened. These findings thus confirm that IOR therapy contributes to improving the quality of life of metastatic brain tumor patients.",,0

One important aim is to decrease the number of hospital transports. For breast cancer, the rate of local relapse after lumpectomy is lower in old patients; moreover, characteristics of the disease are often more favourable (hormonosensitivity, low grade). However, adjuvant irradiation decreases significantly the incidence of breast relapse and must be systematically proposed. Hypofractionnated schedules must be recommended; limited data are available for accelerated partial breast irradiation in old women and these techniques must not be used in routine. For low or intermediate risk prostate cancer, assessment of comorbidities is crucial before considering any invasive treatment. A life expectancy of at least 10 years is required if a curative approach, potentially toxic is proposed. In this case, radiotherapy is often the good choice, giving less sequelae than surgery. The indication of androgen deprivation must take into account cardiovascular and bone history. Management of gynaecological cancers must follow the same recommendations as in young women. Exclusive postoperative brachytherapy must be recommended in early stage endometrial carcinomas. Brachytherapy must be also systematically integrated in the radiotherapy program for cervix cancers, even in old women.",fre,0

Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) has an important role in the management of infiltrating breast cancer, not only to improve local control but also overall survival. So, all attempt of de-escalation must be performed in the context of large prospective studies. However, RT could induce some complications and last 5 to 7 weeks. Three ways of RT de-escalation have been studied: * To spare some patients from RT: patients older than 65-70, with a tumour of less than 3cm, without positive nodes and with positive estrogen receptors have a low local relapse rate even without RT (around 10 [%] at 10 years). But, even in this group, RT decreases significantly this local relapse rate (2 [%]). So the no-radiotherapy option must be discussed with the patient, balancing the potential benefit in local control against the duration and constraints of the treatment.* To favour hypofractionation, which is now a validated option for patients without bad prognostic factors* To perform partial breast irradiation, either by intersticial brachytherapy or intra-operative radiotherapy which are particularly indicated for patients with good prognostic features.

This study aimed to compare 3D-treatment planning parameters in the supine versus prone position. Method: Patients with early stage breast cancer receiving APBI with MammoSiteTM balloon brachytherapy were evaluated between the dates of September 2008 and October 2009. Patient selection was in accordance with the American Brachytherapy Society guidelines: age >50, infiltrating ductal histology, tumor size <3.0 cm, and absence of nodal disease. After lumpectomy and placement of the MammoSiteTM applicator, each patient underwent computer tomography (CT) evaluation in the supine position followed by immediate CT in the prone position on a dedicated breast board. Using Varian Eclipse V8.6 3-D planning software, the balloon conformality, asymmetry, and distance to skin and chest wall was documented. In addition, the planning target volume (PTV), defined as the volume of tissue expanded 1cm beyond the balloon surface with subtraction of the balloon volume, and areas extending beyond the skin surface or involving pectoralis muscle/chest wall was calculated. A paired t- test was used to compare the data sets. Results: 5 patients with MammoSite<sup>TM</sup> balloons placed after lumpectomy were 3D-CT planned in the supine and prone positions. No significant difference was detected between the supine and prone position data sets with respect to balloon conformality, asymmetry, skin distance, and PTV. A statistically significant difference was observed in balloon to chest wall distance in the prone versus supine position. The mean distance from balloon to chest wall was 1.14 cm (range 0.9-1.6 cm) in the supine position and 3.3 cm (range 1.7 to 5.2cm) in the prone position (P = 0.006). The minimum balloon to skin distance ranged from 3 mm to 21 mm in the supine position and 7mm to 18mm in the prone position (P = 0.654). 1 patient went from 3 mm balloon to skin distance in the supine position to 7 mm in the prone position. Tissue-balloon conformance ranged from 97.4% to 99.9% and 96.7% to 100% in the supine and prone positions respectively (P = 0.868). Balloon asymmetry ranged from 0.0 mm to 1.4 mm and 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm in the supine and prone positions respectively (P = 0.843). The PTV volumes ranged from 65.0 cc to 113.42 cc and 72.8 cc to 114.0 cc in the supine versus prone positions, respectively. Conclusion: Adequate balloon conformality and symmetry can be maintained with use of prone positioning in women receiving APBI with MammoSite<sup>TM</sup>. Prone positioning resulted in a significantly greater distance between the balloon applicator and chest wall than in the supine position. This increased balloon-chest wall distance can allow for greater sparing of normal tissues with less pectoralis muscle and lung receiving radiation.",,0

Inherent to this approach, high skin doses can occur if the balloon to skin distance is small. This has been associated with late skin toxicity, particularly telangiectasia. The Xoft Axxent electronic brachytherapy balloon applicator (Xoft, Fremont, CA) is a novel device for accelerated partial breast irradiation. It is unique in that it uses an electronic 50-kV source. This source has a pronounced anisotropy with constriction of isodose distribution at the proximal end of the catheter. This anisotropy can be considered as an advantage to optimize skin dose when the cavity to skin distance is small. In this study, we simulated various balloon-insertion orientations to optimized skin surface dose. Methods: Breast phantoms were constructed of tissue-equivalent material. Xoft Axxent balloon catheters were inserted at a distance of 6 mm from the surface. The catheter was placed at three different catheter to surface orientations: (1) perpendicular to the surface, (2) oblique to the surface (45degree), and (3) parallel to the surface. Three-dimensional treatment planning was then performed using Nucletron's Plato planning system (Nucletron, Columbia, MD). Multiple dwell positions were used, and the dose was optimized to the target volume. The target volume was defined as volume from the balloon surface to 1-cm distance from the balloon surface or to the phantom surface (if less then 1 cm from the balloon surface). Target volume coverage was compared between plans using dose-volume histograms. Surface doses were compared using isodose line distribution and surface point doses. Plato planned surface doses were then verified by direct measurement using Landauer Dot InLight dosimeters (Landauer, Glenwood, IL). Results: Excellent target coverage was obtained for all three catheter orientations with a D<inf>95</inf> of >95%. Surface dose was lowest for the perpendicular orientation with a calculated dose of 99%. The parallel orientation had the highest surface dose of 164%. The oblique orientation showed intermediate results with a surface dose of 117%. Measured surface doses were reproducible and correlated well with calculated values. Conclusion: Optimized Xoft Axxent balloon catheter orientation using source anisotropy and multiple dwell positions can be used to minimize excessive skin dose and yet maintain optimal tumor cavity coverage when the cavity to skin distance is small. This has the potential to decrease skin late effects and improve cosmetic outcome. Further clinical study is warranted. © 2010 American Brachytherapy Society.",,0

NIBB is noninvasive, yet maintains a high degree of precision by using breast immobilization and image guidance. This makes NIBB an attractive alternative to existing APBI techniques. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty patients were enrolled to an institutional review board-approved prospective clinical trial evaluating APBI using NIBB. The NIBB technique is described in detail. Briefly, patients were treated with the breast compressed and immobilized sequentially in two orthogonal axes for each fraction. Radiation was delivered using collimated emissions from a high-dose-rate iridium-192 source via specialized applicators. The prescribed dose was 34.0 Gy in 10 fractions. Feasibility and tolerability of treatment were assessed. RESULTS: All patients completed protocol treatment. The median age was 68 years. Sixty-three percent of patients had invasive carcinoma, and 37% had ductal carcinoma in situ. All were node negative. Ninety-three percent of patients were postmenopausal. Mean tumor size, tumor bed volume, and breast volume were 1.1 cm, 22.4 cc, and 1591 cc, respectively. NIBB treatment was well tolerated. Median patient-reported discomfort was 1 on a 10-point pain scale. Treatment delivery times were reasonable. The average treatment time per axis was 14 min (5-20 min), and the average time from start of first treatment axis to completion of orthogonal axis was 43 min (30-63 min). Acute skin toxicity was Grade 0, 1, and 2 in 20%, 53%, and 28% of patients, respectively. There were no Grade 3 or greater acute toxicities observed. CONCLUSIONS: NIBB holds promise as an alternative method to deliver APBI. NIBB is feasible and well tolerated by patients. Further investigation of NIBB to deliver APBI is warranted.",eng,0

However, not all patients are candidates for this technique. METHODS: Consecutive patients treated for breast cancer were evaluated. Patients with very small breast size (cup </= A) for whom immobilization could not be achieved were treated with electrons. All others underwent simulation for NIBB boost. The rate of eligibility for NIBB, reasons for ineligibility, and related patient and anatomic factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 52 patients evaluated, 6 patients were ineligible for NIBB because of small breast size. Of the remaining patients who underwent simulation for NIBB boost, 33 patients (72%) were treated with NIBB. Reasons for ineligibility were the absence of identifiable TB (n = 5), inability to position patient/breast to adequately target the TB (n = 4), posterior TB location (n = 3), and discomfort during compression (n = 1). The likelihood of being eligible for NIBB boost was dependent on breast size: </=A (0%), B (50%), C (71%), D-DD (77%), and >DD (80%) (p = 0.002). The presence of surgical clips also predicted eligibility for NIBB: 79% clips vs. 45% without clips (p = 0.05). A posterior TB location was not associated with ineligibility (p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: NIBB boost is feasible in most patients. Patients with larger breast size are more likely to be good candidates. Posterior TB location can be challenging for NIBB, but most patients are still candidates. Surgical clips are very helpful in defining the TB and greatly increase the likelihood of eligibility for NIBB.",eng,0

Materials and Methods: Forty-five patients,O45 years old with unilateral, non-lobular, T1N0 breast cancer or DCIS were treated with adjuvant radiation therapy using accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with single-channel balloon brachytherapy from 2003 to 2009 on an institutional Phase IV protocol. The balloon catheter was placed within 4 weeks of breast-conserving surgery. All patients were given prophylactic antibiotics. PTV was lumpectomy site plus 1 cm margin. Dose was 34 Gy using high-dose-rate Ir-192 prescribed to 1cm from surface of balloon delivered in 10 fractions given BID 6 hours apart. All patients had CT simulation planning. X-ray verification was done before each fraction to confirm position and stability of the implant. Results: At the time of treatment, the median age of patients was 66 years old (range 46-84). The majority of patients had invasive disease; 34 of 45 patients (75%) had infiltrating ductal carcinoma and 3 patients had other histology (1 infiltrating tubular, 1 infiltrating papillary, and 1 infiltrating mucinous carcinoma). Eight of the 45 patients (17%) had DCIS. Acute and chronic toxicity was graded per RTOG guidelines. Eighteen patients (40%) developed acute grade 1 skin reaction, 3 developed grade II-III skin toxicity. Six patients (13%) developed acute infections, 5 had cellulitis and 1 had a yeast infection with a draining sinus tract requiring excision. With regards to chronic skin toxicity, 18 patients (40%) developed a seroma, 1 required treatment with antibiotics and 3 required aspiration. Cosmetic result is good with 9 patients (20%) developing moderate telangiectasias and 2 patients with pigmentation changes. Subcutaneous tissue toxicity grade 1 and 2 was seen in 29% and 42% of patients, respectively. Only 1 patient had a grade 3 subcutaneous tissue reaction. The rate of chest wall toxicity is low in this group with only 1 patient found to have a rib fracture without trauma. The mean followup was 47 months. Two patients developed ipsilateral breast cancer, which are considered local failures based on the NSABP definition. Of note, these two lesions had different histologies and hormone status with respect to their primary cancer. Two patients developed distant failures, 1 brain metastasis and 1 bone (rib) metastasis, biopsy proven. Both of these patients eventually died of disease. Conclusions: APBI with single-channel balloon brachytherapy is an effective means of delivering post-lumpectomy radiation therapy with actuarial 5-year locoregional recurrence free survival of 97%. Overall cosmetic result is good with patient satisfaction. However, considerable morbidity persists at long-term followup with regards to chronic subcutaneous skin toxicity on objective assessment.",,0

Intraoperative electron radiotherapy (IOeRT) is an innovative technique for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) that is applied to selected patients affected by early breast cancer. objectives: To describe our experience with IOeRT at the Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa since we began utilizing this modality in 2006. methods: From April 2006 to September 2010, 31 patients affected by unifocal invasive duct breast carcinoma < 2 cm diameter received wide local resection followed by intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons. Patients were evaluated for early and late complications, and other events, 1 month after surgery and every 3 months thereafter for the duration of the first 2 years. results: After a mean follow-up of 36 months, seven patients developed mild breast fibrosis and three suffered from mild postoperative infection. Rib fractures were observed in four patients before routine lead shielding was initiated. Additional whole-breast irradiation was given to four patients. None of the patients developed local recurrences or other ipsilateral cancers. Similarly, no contralateral cancers or distant metastases were observed. conclusions: Intraoperative electron radiotherapy may be an alternative to external beam radiation therapy in an appropriate selected group of early-stage breast cancer patients. However, long-term results of clinical trials are required to better evaluate the indications and utility of this technique in the management of breast cancer.",,1

A modification of the linear-quadratic formalism was used to calculate the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 50 kV X rays as a function of dose and irradiation time for late-reacting normal tissue and tumor cells. The response was modeled as a function of distance in the tissue based on the distribution of equivalent dose and published dose-response data for pneumonitis and subcutaneous fibrosis after single-dose conventional irradiation. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of tumor cell inactivation was assessed. The RBE for late reactions approached unity at the applicator surface but increased as the absorbed dose decreased with increasing distance from the applicator surface. The ED<inf>50</inf> for pneumonitis was estimated to be reached at a depth of 6-11 mm in the tissue and that for subcutaneous fibrosis at 3-6 mm, depending on the applicator diameter and whether the effect of recovery was included. Thus lung tissue would be spared because of the thickness of the thorax wall. The RBE for tumor cells was higher than for late-reacting tissue.

However, APBI with other modalities is frequently applied in a hypofractionated scheme. The purpose was to determine isoeffective fractionated doses for late reaction compared with single-dose IORT and to model the local risk of recurrence for fractionated treatment. Materials and Methods: Models for normal-tissue reaction and local risk of recurrence (Herskind et al., Radiat. Res. 163:208-15, 2005; Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 72:1575-81, 2008) were modified to incorporate fractionation. Fractionated treatment with 10 fx in five days was assumed with dose prescription at 1 cm from the applicator surface. The increased RBE of 50 kV x rays was estimated using the linear-quadratic formalism or taken to be constant equal to 1.2 or 1.5. Based on EQD2 for the reference radiation, the risk of fibrosis and local risk of recurrence were determined from clinical dose response curves and given as function of distance from the applicator. Results: For a 45 mm diameter applicator size, isoeffective fraction sizes yielding the same radius for 50% risk of fibrosis as single-dose IORT were d = 1.01 Gy with RBE estimated by the L-Q formalism and d = 1.64 Gy if RBE was assumed constant. At these dose levels, the influence of repair of sublethal damage during protracted irradiation was greatly reduced. The difference in dose prescription point (applicator surface for single-dose IORT, 1cm distance for APBI) influenced the isoeffective doses for different applicator sizes. The predicted risk of local recurrence was lower after isoeffective hypofractionation compared with single-dose IORT. The reduction was larger with alpha/beta= 10 Gy than with alpha/beta = 4 Gy for tumour cells but the size of the sphere of equivalence (within which local control is the same as for external beam RT) was larger than 10 mm in all cases. Conclusions: All scenarios predicted a sphere of equivalence larger than the 10mm of tumour bed tissue defined as the target volume in the TARGIT trial. Thus hypofractionated APBI should expand the therapeutic window. However, RBE estimates are sensitive to assumptions of the model at low doses, and the choice of dose depends critically on the actual value of RBE for late reaction. Therefore, the dose-effect relationship for late reaction should be tested in a phase II trial.",,0

The purpose was to model the biological effect of hypofractionated accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) with ten fractions. Material and Methods: The relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) was estimated from the linear-quadratic (L-Q) formalism including repair of sublethal damage or assuming a constant RBE = 1.2-1.5.

In accordance with clinical convention, the dose for APBI was prescribed at 1 cm depth in the tumor bed, whereas for IORT it was prescribed at the applicator surface. Results: The fraction size was fitted to give the same risk of late normal-tissue reaction (fibrosis) as single-dose IORT with a maximum dose of 20 Gy. The isoeffective fraction size at 1 cm depth varied between 1.01 Gy for RBE estimated from the L-Q model and 1.64 Gy for constant RBE. The applicator size and dose prescription point influenced the radial dose distribution.

The purpose was to study the biological effect of large single doses on breast cancer and normal cells in vitro. Materials/Methods: Clonogenic cell survival of human breast cancer cell lines MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was measured by the colony formation assay. In some experiments, unirradiated cells were seeded on 0.5-50x103 feeder cells pre-irradiated with 20 Gy. In experiments with conditioned medium (CM), the medium was collected from mass cultures at 24h post-irradiation. The cell cycle distribution and apoptotic subG1 fraction were measured by flow cytometry. A human cytokine array (Panel A; R&D Systems) was used to detect cytokines secreted into CM. DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) were monitored by immunofluorescent detection of gammaH2AX foci. All irradiations were performed with 6 MV X-rays. Results: Irradiation of MCF7 with 12 Gy reduced the surviving fraction (SF) by approximately four orders of magnitude. However, the SF was strongly influenced by the number of cells seeded per flask. Thus SF was reduced 8.5-fold (95% CI = 4.6-15.7; p < 0.0001; paired t-test, n = 12) corresponding to 88% (95% CI = 78-94%) reduction when the number of seeded cells was increased fivefold (1-5 x 104 per flask). A transferrable inhibitory signal from irradiated cells was suspected since colony formation of unirradiated cells was decreased by up to 28% (95% CI = 22-34%; p < 0.0001, n = 3) when plated on increasing numbers of irradiated (20 Gy) feeder cells. This was corroborated by a similar dose-dependent effect of CM collected from cultures irradiated with 5-15 Gy and added to unirradiated recipient cells, or cells irradiated with a lower dose (4 Gy). The inhibitory effect of CM was confirmed for MDA-MB-231 and HUVEC. However, no significant effect on the apoptotic fraction or the cell cycle distribution was observed. Addition of TGF-beta1, which has been reported to mediate a bystander effect, did not inhibit colony formation. An array of 36 cytokines showed measurable levels of ten cytokines but no significant change by CM. However, CM from irradiated cells produced an increase in gammaH2AX foci in unirradiated cells, implying induction of DNA double-strand breaks. Conclusions: The surviving fraction (SF) after a high dose (12 Gy) was reduced in a cell number-dependent fashion. Part of the effect could be mediated by conditioned medium (CM) from irradiated cultures, suggesting that a dose-dependent bystander effect may be involved at high single doses. No evidence was found in support of the transferrable factor being a cytokine or TGF-beta1. However, the factor appears to mediate induction of double-strand breaks.",,0

Voogd,2009.0,Internal mammary lymph drainage and sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer - A study on 1008 patients,10.1016/j.ejso.2008.06.1493,"INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, axillary sentinel node (SN) biopsy is a standard procedure in the staging of breast cancer. Although the internal mammary (IM) lymph node status is a major independent prognostic factor in breast cancer patients, sampling of IM sentinel nodes (IMSNs) is not performed routinely. The aim of this study was to determine the likelihood of finding IM lymph node metastases in case of IM hotspots on lymphoscintigraphy and evaluate the relevance of IMSN biopsy as a method to improve staging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1997 and May 2006, a total of 1008 consecutive patients with clinically node-negative operable primary breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective study on SN biopsy. Both axillary and IMSNs were sampled, based on lymphoscintigraphy, intraoperative gamma probe detection and blue dye mapping, using 10 mCi (370 MBq) (99m)Tc-nanocolloid injected peritumorally, and 0.5-1.0 ml Patent Blue V injected intradermally. RESULTS: Lymphoscintigraphy showed axillary sentinel nodes in 98% (989/1008) and IMSNs in 20% of the patients (196/1008). Sampling the IM basin, as based on the results of lymphoscintigraphy, was successful in 71% of the patients (139/196) and revealed metastases in 22% (31/139). In 29% of the patients with positive IMSNs (9/31) no axillary metastases were found. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of IMSNs improves nodal staging in breast cancer. Patients with IM hotspots on lymphoscintigraphy have a substantial risk (22%) of metastatic involvement of the IM chain. In addition, true IM node-negative patients can be spared the morbidity associated with adjuvant radiotherapy.",eng,0

New methods of targeting tumors with computed tomography (CT) virtual simulation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron-emission tomography (PET) fusion provide the clinician with information heretofore unknown. Linear accelerators (linacs) with multileaf collimation (MLC) have replaced lead-alloy blocks. Indeed, new attachments to the linacs allow small, pencil beams of radiation to be emitted as the linac gantry rotates around the patient, conforming to three-dimensional (3D) targets as never before. Planning for these delivery systems now takes the form of inverse planning,"" with CT information used to map targets and the structures to be avoided. In the area of brachytherapy, techniques utilizing the 3D information provided by the new imaging modalities have been perfected. Permanent seed prostate implants and high-dose-rate (HDR) irradiation techniques targeting bronchial, head and neck, biliary, gynecologic, and other anatomic targets are now commonplace radiotherapy tools. CT-guided permanent seed implants are being investigated, and a new method of treating early breast cancer with HDR brachytherapy via a balloon catheter placed in the lumpectomized cavity is coming to the forefront.

We initiated a prospective protocol for intraoperative APBI catheter placement using a multi-lumen strut-based device. We hypothesized that with intraoperative pathology assessment of margins and sentinel nodes, all locoregional treatment (surgery and APBI) could be completed within 10 days with acceptable complication rates and cosmesis. METHODS: Eligible patients included women age 50 years or older with clinical T1 estrogen receptor positive (ER+) sentinel lymph node (SLN)-negative invasive ductal cancer or pure ductal carcinoma in situ. Patients were prospectively registered. Cosmesis was assessed using photographs graded independently by three investigators for patients with photos taken 6 months or longer after treatment. RESULTS: From October 2012 to August 2015, we enrolled 123 patients; 110 (90 %) underwent intraoperative catheter placement, whereas 13 did not due to intraoperative pathology findings. 109 APBI patients (99 %) completed their prescribed radiotherapy within 5 days, and all their locoregional therapy within 9 days, whereas one patient with a delayed positive SLN received only boost radiotherapy via catheter followed by conventional whole breast radiation. The 30-day complication rate was 6 %. In 81 patients with at least one-year followup, complications occurred in 14 (17 %) (including infection in five patients and symptomatic seroma in five patients) and correlated with device size (p = 0.05) but not with tumor size or location. The local recurrence rate was 1.8 % (two patients). Scored cosmesis was excellent or good in 88 % and fair in 12 % of patients.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1977 to 1983, 141 patients were treated with whole breast radiotherapy followed by iridium-192 boost after breast-conserving surgery. They were matched 1:1 to patients treated with electron boost. Outcome measures included survival, local recurrence, cosmesis, and complications. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 16.7 and 12.6 years for the implant vs. electron groups (p < 0.001). Rates of local recurrence, freedom from distant metastases, and overall survival at 10/20 years did not differ between the groups, nor did patterns of first failure. Patients in the electron group were more likely to have excellent/good cosmesis than those in the implant group 1 year after radiotherapy (p = 0.014); this trend continued through 10 years but did not reach statistical significance at years 5/10. Complication rates were similar, although patients receiving electron boost seemed less likely to develop breast fibrosis than did those receiving implant boost (23/141 vs. 58/141, respectively, incidence rate ratio 0.7, p = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-year data demonstrate no difference in rates of local recurrence, freedom from distant metastases, overall survival, or patterns of failure between groups treated with these two well-described radiotherapy boost techniques. Better cosmesis was observed in the electron group 1 year after radiotherapy, with a trend continuing for 10 years.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Planning and Day 0 CT scans from 15 consecutive PBSI patients were included. Seromas were contoured on the preimplant CTs. After implant, DIR (MIM Maestro; MIM Software, Inc., Cleveland, OH) was used to adapt preimplant seromas to postimplant scans. Resulting seromas were evaluated for accuracy and adjusted if required, and pre- and postimplant seroma volumes were recorded and compared. DIR was validated by assessing the spatial correspondence of surgical clips pre- and postimplant in eight cases. Retrospectively, rigid registration was also investigated. RESULTS: Surgical clip location corresponded between pre- and postimplant images with a median agreement of <1.0 mm. The seroma defined using DIR was an acceptable rendering of the postimplant seroma in 9 of 15 cases, and in the remaining six cases, minor alterations (mean, 1.0 +/- 0.2 mm) were made. Mean change in seroma volumes between preimplant and postimplant imaging was -6.1 +/- 26.4%. Rigid registration exhibited unacceptable variability, with poor concordance in postimplant seroma between different observers (median conformity index, 26.5%; range, 0-52.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Deformable image registration can be used to adapt the preimplant seroma to postimplant PBSI images and is recommended for implant quality assurance in PBSI. Using deformable registration avoids uncertainties associated with poor seroma visualization and interobserver variability when rigid registration is performed. The accurate deformation of implanted surgical clips demonstrates the reliability of deformable image registration for PBSI.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Postoperative treatment plans (Day 0) for 15 permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) and 10 multicatheter high-dose-rate (MC-HDR) brachytherapy patients were included. Retrospectively, three skin structures were contoured: 2 mm external from the body; and subsurface layers 2 mm and 4 mm thick. Maximum point dose (Dmax), doses to small volumes (e.g., D0.2cc), and the volumes receiving a percentage of the prescription dose (V%, e.g., V66) were calculated. D0.2cc was investigated as a surrogate to the dose given to 1 cm(2) of skin (D1cm(2)). Pearson product-moment correlation (R(2)) was computed between metrics. RESULTS: Observed trends were consistent across brachytherapy technique. V% did not correlate well with any other metrics: median (range) R(2), 0.63 (0.43, 0.77) and 0.69 (0.3, 0.89) for PBSI and MC-HDR, respectively. Dmax was inconsistently correlated across contours and not well correlated with doses to small volumes: median (range) R(2), 0.85 (0.76, 0.93) and 0.88 (0.83, 0.93) for PBSI and MC-HDR, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: Doses to small volumes are robust measures of breast skin dose and given skin's strong area effect, D0.2cc for a 2 mm thick skin layer, a simple surrogate of D1cm(2), is recommended for recording skin dose in any breast brachytherapy. Dmax is not robust and should be avoided.",eng,0

Kanemitsu,1999.0,Value of extended resection and intraoperative radiotherapy for resectable pancreatic cancer,", ","Since 1984 intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) combined with extended resection for pancreatic cancer has been performed in our clinic to prevent local recurrence. Following extended resection, a dose of 30 Gy of 9- to 12-MeV electrons is administered to the operative field, including the paraaortic area from the diaphragm above to the inferior mesenteric artery below. The 5-year survival rate was 15.3% in all 37 cases, 20.2% in patients who had macroscopic tumor clearance, and 16.9% in patients with stage IVa tumor according to the Japanese classification. In autopsies of 10 patients who underwent combined therapy, four had local recurrence enclosed by thick, firm connective tissue. There was no local control recurrence in two patients who underwent noncurative resection. Enhanced local control induced by the combined therapy, however, has only a limited impact on overall survival because of the systemic spread of disease, especially hepatic metastases. At present, as we have no effective treatment for hepatic metastases, it is important to perform an extended resection with IORT on carefully selected patients. The combined therapy may offer the best approach to control local recurrence when dealing with advanced, but not highly advanced, cancer as defined by the stage of tumor. Therefore a combination of IORT and extended resection can have an impact on the results of surgical treatment for pancreatic cancer when anticancer treatment of hepatic metastases is established.",eng,0

Alternatives to 6 weeks of WBI have been shown to be safe and effective for subsets of breast cancer patients, and the use of preoperative chemotherapy allows BCT in some women who require mastectomy if surgery is the initial step in treatment.

All 30 patients were females, with an age range of 40-83 (mean: 61.3). All patients had at least one-surgical procedure performed in the ipsilateral breast. 24 (80%) had a history of ipsilateral breast carcinoma. All seromas were unilateral (right: 15, left: 15). Five (5) of 30 were located in the axilla, and 2 in the chest wall (status-post mastectomy). Twelve (12) cases were associated with scars, 6 with implants, 1 with balloon brachytherapy-associated cavities, and 1 with transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous (TRAM) flap. All seromas were fibrinous (clumped on ThinPrep, diffuse on DQ) and paucicellular, with variable numbers of lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages. Neither carcinoma nor ALCL was identified (1 case was negative on flow cytometry evaluation). Conclusions: Although all mammary seromas were cytologically bland, and negative for malignancy in this series; cytologists need to be aware of the possibility of ALCL in cytology specimens.""",,0

Holliday,2001.0,A new radiocolloid for sentinel node detection in breast cancer,", ","BACKGROUND: The optimal radioactive tracer and technique for sentinel lymph node localization in breast cancer is yet to be determined. The dilemma of small particle size with dispersion to second echelon nodes versus failure of migration of larger radiocolloids needs to be resolved. A new radiocolloid preparation with particle size under 0.1 micron was developed with excellent primary/post lymphatic entrapment ratio. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a new 99mTc radiocolloid cysteine-rhenium colloid in sentinel lymph node (SLN) localization for breast cancer. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with newly diagnosed T1 or T2 breast cancer underwent injection of 99mTc-labeled cysteine-rhenium colloid followed by lymphoscintigraphy. Same day SLN biopsy with patent blue dye and intraoperative gamma probe to identify SLNs were performed. RESULTS: SLN mapping and intraoperative localization were successful in 46/47 (98%) of patients. The blue dye radioactive tracer concordance was 94%. There was one false-negative in a patient with a nonpalpable tumor that underwent ultrasound-guided peritumoral radiocolloid injection. CONCLUSIONS: 99mTc-cysteine-rhenium colloid is highly effective in identifying SLNs. It has the advantage of smaller particle size than sulfur colloid with easier lymphatic migration. It has a more neutral pH with less pain on injection and does not require filtration, thereby minimizing radiation exposure to technologists.",eng,0

Furthermore, the grade of satisfaction with IORT of patients and physicians has been investigated. Materials and methods: Patients for IORT were carefully selected. Only patients with unifocal, ductal-invasive breast cancer, without a DCIS-component in the preoperative core biopsy were considered for IORT treatment. This retrospective study included all consecutive patients who underwent IORT in our hospital from 5/2009 till 4/2010 and is based on a voluntary questionnaire. The same questionnaire was also given to the treating physicians of the patients. Main outcome parameters were reasons for decision to undergo IORT and satisfaction with this new method. Data analysis was conducted with SPSS. Results: The main reasons for patients and physician to decide on IORT are different. Saving time is a very important reason for patients, whereas for physicians, local tumour control plays a decisive role. Further it is demonstrated that IORT is well accepted both by patients and physicians. Conclusions: Both patients and physicians are satisfied with IORT (intrabeam), the estimation of benefits differs.",,0

This article reviews the indications, clinical utility, and nursing interventions for the Mammosite Radiation Therapy System (Proxima Therapeutics, Alpharetta, GA) and INTRABEAM (Photoelectron Corporation, North Billerica, MA) radiation therapy system. Each uses a slightly different approach to provide definitive radiotherapy to the breast tumor bed following excision. Radiation oncology nurses should have an understanding of how each system works to provide optimal care as it pertains to education, side effect management, and catheter care for patients receiving each of these types of radiotherapy. These innovative alternatives will greatly reduce required treatment time if clinical studies find them to be equivocal or superior to traditional radiation therapy techniques.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprises 42 patients. Sonographically guided peri-lesional injection of the radiopharmacon was performed on 40 breasts. Two patients with melanoma of the upper extremity underwent intracutaneous injection. After the acquisition of images with the gamma camera, the delineated lymph nodes were marked on the skin. A high-frequency transducer with an adapted gamma probe was then used to identify the SLN. Before surgery, the SLN was localised with a hook-wire. Node activity was controlled intraoperatively. RESULTS: In two out of 42 cases, lymphatic mapping did not reveal SLNs. Multiple SLNs at different sites, all with similar activity, were demonstrated in one patient, while in another patient the sonographically visible lymph nodes were too small for exact correlation. Hook-wire localisation of the SLN was performed in the remaining 38 axillary spaces. Gamma probe-assisted sonography allowed for correct localisation of SLNs in 35/38 patients (92 %). Localisation was not correct in 3 patients (8 %), but in all cases the hook-wire was located next to the SLN. CONCLUSION: Preoperative identification and correct localisation of the SLN is possible in a high percentage of cases. This method allows rapid intraoperative detection of the SLN and could be used for exact correlation of sonographic appearance and histopathological results.",eng,0

Accurate delineation of tumor margins is important for preventing local recurrence. METHODS: Six patients with HER2-positive in situ or invasive ductal carcinoma were administered 74MBq (0.5mg) of (111)In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab fragments and counts in the tumor, surgical cavity wall and en face margins were measured intraoperatively at 72h post-injection using the Navigator or C-Trak gamma-probes. Margins were evaluated histologically. Quantitative whole body planar imaging was performed to estimate radiation absorbed doses using OLINDA/EXM software. SPECT imaging of the thorax was performed to evaluate tumor uptake. The pharmacokinetics of elimination from the blood and plasma were determined over 72h. RESULTS: There were no acute adverse reactions from (111)In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab fragments and no changes in hematological or biochemical indices were found over a 3month period. (111)In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab fragments exhibited a biphasic elimination from the blood and plasma with t1/2alpha=11.9h and 7.5h, respectively, and t1/2beta=26.6 and 20.7h, respectively. The radiopharmaceutical accumulated in the liver, spleen and kidneys. SPECT imaging did not reveal tumor in any patient. The mean effective dose was 0.146mSv/MBq (10.8mSv for 74MBq). Counts in excised tumors were low but were higher than in margins. Margins in two patients harboured tumor but this was not correlated with counts obtained using the gamma-probes. Surgical cavity counts were high and likely due to detection of gamma-photons outside the surgical field. CONCLUSION: We conclude that it was not feasible, at least at the administered amount of radioactivity used in this study, to reliably detect the margins of disease in patients with in situ or invasive ductal carcinoma intraoperatively using a hand-held gamma-probe and (111)In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab fragments due to low uptake in the tumor and involved margins.",eng,0

Our goal was to identify, quantify, and compare the pre and post surgical mammographic findings of patients who received IORT and EBRT in a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. Materials: This is a descriptive analysis of mammographic findings performed by an independent, blinded breast radiologist at a Comprehensive Cancer Center. It included patients with early stage invasive breast cancer undergoing breast conserving therapy between July 2005 and December 2009. Treatment groups were compared with regard the 1, 2 and 4 year incidence of 6 post-operative mammographic findings: architectural distortion, skin thickening, skin retraction, calcifications, fat necrosis, and mass density. Results: Blinded review of 93 sets of mammograms of 15 IORT and 16 EBRT patients demonstrated no statistically significant difference on univariate analysis in the incidence of each outcome measure at years 1, 2, and 4.

However, the use of IORT in the management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is limited by the inherent challenges of evaluating the extent of disease and ensuring adequate tumor resection in patients with pure DCIS. As a result, in the absence of pre-treatment surgical pathology results, patients with pure DCIS are commonly excluded from protocols evaluating the use of IORT in the management of DCIS. Materials: IORT was administered immediately following lumpectomy or reexcision in women with pure DCIS under an IRB-approved protocol. Prior to IORT, all patients were evaluated preoperatively with digital diagnostic mammography and bilateral breast contrast enhanced MRI (1.5 Tesla) to evaluate the extent of residual disease, and patients with imaging evidence of DCIS > 4cm were excluded from IORT. All eligible patients underwent 2-wire localizations to bracket residual imaging abnormalities or biopsy site markers Following specimen radiography, IORT was administered to the tumor bed using the Intrabeam Photon Radiosurgery System (Carl Zeiss-Meditec, Inc., Oberkochen, Germany), with a prescribed dose of 20 Gy to the surgical margins. Diagnostic imaging studies, core needle biopsy, and surgical pathology results were evaluated to identify factors associated with successful breast conserving surgery with IORT. (Figure presented) Results: Sixteen (16) patients with DCIS underwent lumpectomy (n=13) or re-excision (n=3) followed by IORT. Breast conserving surgery (BCS) was successfully performed in 94% (15/16) of patients receiving IORT. For patients who received IORT at the initial lumpectomy, 92% (12/13) had successful breast conserving surgery (BCS). Two of the twelve successful lumpectomy patients required additional therapy to re-excise margins <1mm. The one unsuccessful patient underwent repeat re-excision and subsequent mastectomy for transected margins. Among the 3 patients who first received IORT during a re-excision for positive or close margins, 100% (3/3) successfully underwent BCS and required no additional surgical or radiation therapies. Among patients receiving IORT at the time of lumpectomy, the mean maximal diameter of the DCIS was 18.9mm (range: 3-30mm) by pathology and 14.4mm (range: 6-40mm) on digital mammography. The lesion could only be detected by MRI in 46% (6/13) of patients and by ultrasound in 39% (5/13) of patients for mean maximal diameters of 16.6mm (range 8-38mm) and 15.6mm (range 7-26mm) respectively. Conclusions: IORT is a feasible treatment option for breast conserving surgery in women with DCIS. Although 3/16 patients required additional therapy due to inadequate surgical margins, 77% of patients receiving IORT at the time of initial lumpectomy required no additional surgery or radiotherapy. Although the best outcomes were obtained in patients who received IORT at a second operation, most patients who received IORT at the time of the initial lumpectomy were spared a second operation or the need for post-operative radiotherapy. The 23% re-excision rate for DCIS is well within the accepted standard for DCIS treated with lumpectomy, and only one of 13 patients who received IORT at the initial lumpectomy failed to meet the NSABP standard of clear margin resection-non-transection. In this study, mammography was the best predictor of histological lesion size because lesions could be identified in each patient. Perhaps as a result of the small lesion size, non-visibility of the lesion(s), and the use of core needle biopsies, MRI and ultrasound had limited value for predicting lesion size in women with pure DCIS.",,0

Feiler,2012.0,Intraoperative radiotherapy in previously augmented patients with early-stage breast cancer,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed14&AN=71086138","Background: Breast conservation therapy (BCT) is the preferred treatment for early stage breast cancer (ESBC), providing equivalent survival to mastectomy with improved quality of life (QOL). Nevertheless, previously augmented women (PAW) with ESBC are often denied access to BCT due to potential complications arising from capsular contracture from exposure to whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT). Instead of BCT, PAW are commonly advised to undergo total, skin-sparing, or nipple-sparing mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction to eliminate the need for WBRT. These more extensive procedures alter the form and function of the breast, increase the risk of perioperative morbidity, prolong postoperative recovery, and add incremental costs. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) emerged as a strategy for delivering breast radiotherapy that preserves the option of BCT in PAW with ESBC. IORT confines the effects of radiotherapy to the quadrant of the breast and to the portion of the prosthesis in proximity to the cancer. Since IORT is administered at the time of BCT, it permits insertion of a radiation barrier to further shield the prosthesis from effects of radiotherapy. Methods: We present several examples of PAW who underwent BCT combined with IORT for the treatment of ESBC. Results: Four women with an average age of 51.8 years (range: 47-57) were treated with BCT and IORT for ESBC using the Intrabeam System (Carl Zeiss-Meditec, Inc., Oberkochen, GE). All women had either saline (SA), silicone (SI), or combination retropectoral implants (RP). All pathological margins were clear and IORT was administered without complications. Average follow-up was 26 months (range: 1-72 months). None experienced a recurrence and breast cosmesis was acceptable in all women. Conclusions: IORT preserves the option of BCT in PAW by reducing the impact of radiotherapy on the breast. This radiotherapy approach eliminates the physical burden, impact on QOL, and cost of more extensive breast procedures. Consequently, IORT should be considered a preferred treatment for PAW facing a diagnosis of ESBC. (Table presented) .",,0

In this investigation, we model potential cost savings associated with the use of single-fraction intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) compared to two commonly used alternative radiotherapy approaches. Methods: A database survey was performed of female subjects undergoing breast conserving surgery (BCS) with or without sentinel lymphadenectomy at HealthCare Partners, a major IPA in metropolitan Los Angeles, CA. Subjects were identified by cross-referencing ICD-9 codes (174.0-174.9) for invasive breast cancer, CPT codes for BCS (19120, 19125, or 19301), and CPT codes for sentinel node biopsy without ALND (38500, 38525, or 38740). Calculations were based on the 2011 U.S. Medicare Fee Schedule. Treatment costs and savings were modeled assuming that patients with node-negative disease who underwent BCS were eligible for accelerated partial breast irradiation based on American Society of Breast Surgeons Guidelines (age >45, IDCA, DCIS, size <3 cm, node and margin negative). Results: A sample of 1,478 women meeting criteria was evaluated to determine the average per-patient cost of breast radiotherapy comparing three modalities: single-fraction IORT ($4,402), 5-day multi-lumen balloon brachytherapy (MLBB) (e.g., MammoSite) ($12,021), and standard 6-week whole breast external beam radiotherapy followed by a tumor bed boost (WBRT) ($8,988). IORT was approximately 49% the cost of standard 6-week WBRT and 37% the cost of MLBB. Conclusions: When eligible breast cancer patients are offered IORT as an alternative to WBRT, the expenditures from this sample may be reduced from $13.3M to $6.5M, a savings of $6.8M. Compared to MLBB, IORT may reduce radiotherapy expenditures from $17.8M to $6.5M, a savings of $11.3M. (Table presented) .",,0

This 50 kVp eBx source has been well characterized in water. When inflating a balloon with water, it may be possible for residual air to remain in the balloon. A first order approximation of the effect of an air bubble was made using TG-43 parameters and Monte Carlo modeling (MCNPX). Materials and Methods: A 20 mm radius balloon with a single central dwell point was modeled using TG-43 parameters and with MCNPX. The dosimetric effects of a reduction of attenuation can be modeled by shifting the depth parameter in the radial dose function, g(r), by the height of the bubble, using r' = r - bubble height. The MCNPX code was used to simulate the same configuration with and without a 5 mm air bubble for the same geometry. The effect of a typical linear train of sources at non-central dwell points was also examined using TG-43. For this clinical plan model, the source catheter axis is assumed to be parallel to the air-bubble, with nine dwell positions, spaced 5 mm apart, and relative weighting as shown. Bubbles in a sphere are ovoid in shape, so we modeled the diameter of the bubble as twice the height. Results: For a single dwell point, the relative increase in dose due to an air bubble as a function of air bubble height as modeled by TG-43 is shown in the figure. For a 5 mm tall air bubble, the dose is predicted to increase by 23%, 18% and 15% at the surface, 5 mm above the surface and 10 mm above the surface. For the MCNPX calculations at that point (also in figure 1), an increase of 22%, 20.5 and 18% was computed. For a plan with multiple dwell points, the effect is decreased for smaller bubbles as x-rays from off-axis dwell points will not intersect the bubble. For multiple dwell points, 1 mm bubbles would increase dose by less than 3.8%, 0.7% and 0.6% at at 0 mm, 5 mm and 10 mm above the balloon surface. An air-bubble of 2 mm high x 4 mm wide would increase dose by 8%, 3.5% and 3% at the same points, and a 5 mm high x 10 mm wide air bubble would increase dose by 23%, 18% and 1%, respectively. Conclusions: An air bubble in a balloon for a Xoft eBx treatment will result in an increase of dose that is not accounted for by a standard TG-43 plan. With consistent patient positioning, the air bubbles will likely be at or near the same location for each treatment. Modeling this dose increase with a modifed TG-43 is supported by the MCNPX model results; although the TG-43 model underestimates the overall effects at 10 mm above the balloon surface for a 5 mm tall air bubble. These results indicate that small residual air bubbles in the balloon of less than 2 mm tall x 4 mm wide would have a negligible or minor overall effect on dosimetry. Air bubbles between 3-4 mm tall x 6-8 mm wide could have an impact on the skin dose, and should either be removed, reduced, or dosimetrically evaluated for the individual patient plan to verify that the skin dose is within acceptable limits. Residual air bubbles of greater than 4 mm in height and greater than 8 mm in diameter should be removed or reduced.",,0

Materials/Methods: The SAVI Collaborative Research Group is a coalition of 14 institutions with a registry of 1010 patients treated with strutbased brachytherapy for intracavitary accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). All patients underwent lumpectomy followed by APBI to 34 Gy in 10 BID fractions. CT-based planning was performed and DVH analyses included: V90(%), V95(%), V100(%), V150(cc), V200(cc), and V300(cc); minimum skin distance (mm); maximum skin dose (Gy); tumor size (mm); PTV-Eval (cc). Toxicity outcomes of telangiectasia, fibrosis, and seroma were graded using the CTCAE v3.0 Scale and fat necrosis using Lovey et al. Univariate analysis was performed using Fisher's Exact test comparing toxicity versus no toxicity results between characteristic categories. Results: A total of 491 patients were analyzed for toxicity with a median follow-up of 17.3 months. Mean results were 95.8%, 92.6%, 88.6% for V90, V95, and V100. Mean results were 28.9 cc, 14.0 cc, and 4.6 cc for V150, V200, and V300. The mean values for skin distance was 12.9 mm; 27.7 Gy for maximum skin dose; 12.4 mm for tumor size; and 70.8 cc for PTV-Eval. The rate of subcutaneous fibrosis was 17.3% grade 1, 1.2% grade 2, <1% grade >2. This correlated with V95 (94.2% vs. 92.3%, p = 0.006), V100 (90.8% vs. 88.1%, p < 0.001), and V200 (15.1 cc vs. 13.7 cc, p < 0.005). The symptomatic fat necrosis rate was 0.4%. The rate of telangiectasia was 3.3% (2.6% grade 1, 0.6% grade 2) and did not correlate with the minimum skin distance or the maximum skin dose. Conclusions: This is the largest toxicity report of APBI using strut-based brachytherapy to date. The low incidence rate of symptomatic fat necrosis precluded any meaningful assessment of association with treatment parameters. The analyses demonstrate favorable toxicity profiles relative to published first-generation intracavitary balloon brachytherapy. These patients will be followed long-term in an effort to better define optimal dosimetric parameters with their associated clinical correlates.",,0

Materials and methods Candidates initially deemed eligible for a prospective APBI trial based on physical examination, mammography, and ultrasound (US) were further evaluated with breast MRI before treatment. All abnormal MRI findings were biopsied. Results Between 2002 and 2011, 180 women who met inclusion criteria for APBI underwent breast MRI prior to treatment (median age = 59; range 38-86). 126 tumors (70%) were invasive carcinomas with or without associated DCIS, while 54 (30%) were pure DCIS. Breast MRI confirmed unifocal disease in 109 patients with 111 cancers (60.5% of MRI cohort). Multifocal disease was identified in 19 patients (10.5% of MRI cohort), while multicentric disease was present in 3 patients (1.6% of MRI cohort). Five patients (4%) had an MRI-detected contralateral cancer. False positive MRI findings were seen in 45 patients (25% of MRI cohort). Pre-menopausal patients and patients with tumors >2 cm were more likely to have MRI-detected multifocal/multicentric disease. While there was no statistically significant correlation between multifocal/multicentric disease and breast density, tumor histology, grade, ER status, or Her2/Neu expression, numbers in each category were small, suggesting a lack of statistical power to detect differences that may be clinically meaningful. One hundred and fifty-two of the 180 patients (84.4%) successfully completed lumpectomy and APBI, while 6.7% of the cohort underwent mastectomy.

Materials and Methods: Women aged 40 years or older with unifocal invasive or intraductal carcinoma r2.5 cm on physical examination, mammography, and ultrasound (US) were evaluated with breast MRI before enrollment on an APBI trial using single-fraction intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) or fractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Abnormal MRI findings were evaluated with US-guided or MRI-guided biopsy. Results: Between December 2002 and March 2005, 51 women (median age = 61 y; range, 40 to 83 y) who met inclusion criteria underwent breast MRI before APBI. MRI demonstrated limited disease in 41 patients (80.4%): 34 received APBI using IORT (22) or 3DCRT (12), whereas 7 elected standard whole-breast radiotherapy. Ten of the 51 patients (19.6%) had indeterminate or suspicious enhancement patterns on MRI. Five of these 10 (9.8% of MRI cohort) underwent US-guided or MRI-guided biopsy revealing normal breast tissue without atypia: 3 were treated with APBI using IORT (5.9% of MRI cohort) and 2 underwent standard breast conservation therapy (3.9% of MRI cohort). The remaining 5 patients (9.8% of MRI cohort) had MRI findings revealing previously unsuspected pectoral fascia involvement (1), multifocal disease (3), or multicentric disease (1): 2 were treated with standard breast conservation therapy, whereas 3 underwent mastectomy without adjuvant radiotherapy. Conclusions: Pretreatment breast MRI altered patient selection for APBI by identifying additional disease in 9.8% of the candidates, all of whom fit into the cautionary"" or ""unsuitable"" categories as defined by the American Society for Radiation Oncology APBI consensus guidelines.

As different techniques were used in these trials in a broad range of patients, it is unclear if the results obtained were due to differences in technique, type of radiation or patient selection. The goal of the current study was to review findings from studies using only electron IORT in appropriately selected patients considered suitable for APBI. Methods: We performed a literature search addressing the use of electron IORT as the sole radiation treatment for early stage breast cancer. Publications that delivered IORT prior to tumor excision, and those that did not deliver the prescription dose as deeply as the chest wall, were excluded. The ASTRO and ESTRO Consensus guidelines were used to select patients from these studies based upon society derived criteria for the application of APBI. ESTRO Good category differs from ASTRO Suitable in that it allows patients > 50, tumors up to 3 cm, and any ER/PgR status. Results: A total of 2,449 patients (pts) met the search criteria in 7 trials (1 phase III, 6 retrospective). Median follow up ranged from 2-6 yrs. In the 715 pts who met the ASTRO Suitable criteria, the actuarial rate of LR varied from 0 -1.5%. Of the 1017 pts that met the ESTRO Good criteria, the rate of LR varied from 0 -1.9%. Conclusions: Excellent results were observed using electron IORT as the sole radiation treatment in appropriately selected patients using ASTRO and ESTRO guidelines for APBI. Longer follow-up and additional studies are necessary to validate these findings and explore if additional patients may be suitable for this form of APBI if the total dose and QA techniques are optimized.

Anterior decompression by means of a transoral or transcervical approach followed by posterior instrumentation commonly is used to treat this pathology. OBJECTIVE: To develop an innovative operative technique to correct reducible occipitocervical instability using a purely posterior approach. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two patients presented to our institution with occipitocervical instability. One patient developed vertical migration of the odontoid secondary to a retropharyngeal abscess after radiation treatment. The second patient developed occipitocervical instability as a result of pathological destruction of C2 from a breast metastasis. Both patients were myelopathic with severe neck pain. TECHNIQUE: Both patients were brought to the operating room for intraoperative reduction and fixation using a purely posterior approach. This new technique obviated the need for an anterior decompression procedure or preoperative halo reduction. Postoperatively, both patients had excellent restoration of spinal alignment as well as improvement in both pain and myelopathy. CONCLUSION: We achieved intraoperative reduction of occipitocervical instability through a purely posterior approach. This technique adds a tool to the armamentarium of techniques used for the treatment of occipitocervical instability.",eng,0

Here we present a case diagnosed as primary breast lymphoma with imprint cytology during intraoperative frozen consultation. CASE: A 67-year-old woman presented with a palpable, non-tender mass in her left breast that she had had for 2 weeks. The mammogram and ultrasound studies revealed 1 lobular mass in the left breast without axillary lymphadenopathy. Imprint cytology helped diagnose malignant lymphoma of the breast, preventing radical surgery. CONCLUSION: Frozen artifact may obscure the evaluation of cytomorphology during intraoperative consultation. Imprint cytology may help due to less artifact with the cytologic details. Primary breast lymphomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast tumors.

Blough,2010.0,Dosimetric effects of air pocket sizes in MammoSite treatment as accelerated partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer,", ","MammoSite Brachytherapy System had been used as one of the Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) techniques since 2002. The clinical results from several clinical institutions had shown comparable treatment efficacy, cosmesis, and toxicity, to other APBI techniques. During MammoSite treatment, air cavities had been one of the primary issues causing treatment cancellation or delay. With the tolerance of the air volume less than 10% of the total Planning Target Volume (PTV) been set, there is still no data available to show the actual dose delivered to the breast tissue with the existence of the air pocket. In this paper, Monte Carlo N-Particle version 5 (MCNP5) was used to model a hypothesis MammoSite phantom with different sizes of air pockets, and compared to the calculation results from the treatment planning system (TPS) without heterogeneous corrections. It was found that without heterogeneous corrections, the difference between the TPS and MCNP5 calculations in the air cavity surface doses and PTV point doses can be up to 2.02% and 3.61%, respectively, with the balloon and air pocket size combinations calculated in this paper. Based on the distance from the point of interest to the balloon surface, an approximate dose can be calculated using the linear relationship found in this study. These equations provide a quick and simple way to predict the actual dose delivered to the breast soft tissue located within the PTV. With the equation applied to the dose from the TPS, the dose error caused by the air pocket during MammoSite treatment can be reduced to the minimum.",eng,0

We describe the steps of such a program in Belgium. First, the promising innovative radiotherapy techniques and their indications were identified by a working group of interested Belgian radiation oncologists and representatives from government organisations concerned: KCE, the National Health and Disability Insurance (RIZIV- INAMI), FOD-SPF Public Health, and the Federal Nuclear Control Agency (FANC-AFCN). The techniques considered were novel radiotherapy techniques for treating early breast cancer and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). For both novel strategies of radiotherapy, indications were specified and the current level of evidence was determined based on literature reviews and consensus statements of professional societies.2 (Table 1) Step 2. A time-driven activity-based costing study Second, we performed a time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) of radiotherapy treatments in 10 centres representative for Belgium.1 Time measurements were performed during a 4 week period in the second half of 2012. Results are expressed in 2011 euros. The average SBRT cost of 6 222 is similar to the cost of 3D or intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) schemes with hypo- or standard fractionation, which range from 3 993 to 7 379. The cost of SBRT varied by centre from-about 3 000 euro to over 12 000, by technique used in the centre (tracking SBRT had a slightly higher cost than other modalities) and by fractionation (higher cost for higher fractionation). The average cost of IORT APBI delivered as MeV electrons using a mobile linear accelerator system (Mobetron) was 3 063 euro and 2744 euro if delivered as kV photons (Intrabeam). These costs are at the low end of whole breast irradiation (WBI) schemes without boost ( 3 008 to 4 683euro). Step 3. Research funding, registration of activities and clinical outcome. The only items the RIZIV-INAMI project is financing are the innovative radiotherapy technique and the obligatory registration at the Cancer Registry (covered by RIZIV-INAMI art 56 1). All cases are registered by the participating centres in a specific registration module (web application) of the Cancer Registry. RIZIV-INAMI is currently providing research funding for a 4 year period using agreements (conventies - conventions"") with interested hospitals for the identified innovative radiotherapy/indication pairs. The funding is per treatment, based on the cost study results. In addition, the funding is conditional to the completion of a set of relevant variables in the cancer registry for each patient treated using such an innovative technique. (Table Presented).""",,0

Macklis,2015.0,Radium-223 in the treatment of osteoblastic metastases: a critical clinical review,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.12.061,"The element radium (Ra) was discovered by the Curies in 1898 and within a decade was in broad scientific testing for the management of several forms of cancer. The compound was known to give rise to a series of both high-energy particulate and penetrating gamma-emissions. The latter found an important role in early 20th century brachytherapy applications, but the short-range alpha-particles seemed much less useful. Although highly cytotoxic when released within a few cell diameters of critical cell nuclei, the dense double-strand break damage was poorly repaired, and concerns regarding treatment-related toxicities and secondary malignancies halted clinical development. Moreover, the most common isotope of Ra has an exceptionally long half-life (>1600 years for (226)Ra) that proved daunting when aiming for a systemic cancer therapy. Fortunately, other radium isotopes have more convenient half-lives while still producing cytotoxic alpha particles. Radium-223 dichloride has a half-life of 11.4 days, and this isotope was identified as an excellent candidate for radionuclide therapy of cancers metastatic to bone. The calcium-mimetic chemical properties of the radium allowed intravenous infusion with rapid uptake to sites of new bone formation. The highly efficient bone localization suggested a potential therapeutic role for osteoblastic bone metastases, and a series of phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials was undertaken to explore this possibility. This series of clinical explorations culminated in the ALSYMPCA trial, an international, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study that accrued 921 symptomatic men with bone-metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Results of this trial demonstrated a prolongation of overall survival, and regulatory agencies around the world have now approved this product as a treatment for advanced prostate cancer.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using MarketScan healthcare claims, we identified 64,112 women treated from 2003 to 2012 with lumpectomy followed by radiation (brachytherapy vs EBRT). Brachytherapy was further classified by multichannel versus single-channel applicator approach. We identified the risks and predictors of 1-year infectious and noninfectious postoperative adverse events using logistic regression and temporal trends using Cochran-Armitage tests. We estimated the 5-year Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence of radiation-associated adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 4522 (7.1%) patients received brachytherapy (50.2% multichannel vs 48.7% single-channel applicator). The overall risk of infectious adverse events was higher after brachytherapy than after EBRT (odds ratio [OR] = 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.34, P<.001). However, over time, the frequency of infectious adverse events after brachytherapy decreased, from 17.3% in 2003 to 11.6% in 2012, and was stable after EBRT at 9.7%. Beyond 2007, there were no longer excess infections with brachytherapy (P=.97). The overall risk of noninfectious adverse events was higher after brachytherapy than after EBRT (OR=2.27; 95% CI 2.09-2.47, P<.0001). Over time, the frequency of noninfectious adverse events detected increased: after multichannel brachytherapy, from 9.1% in 2004 to 18.9% in 2012 (Ptrend = .64); single-channel brachytherapy, from 12.8% to 29.8% (Ptrend<.001); and EBRT, from 6.1% to 10.3% (Ptrend<.0001). The risk was significantly higher with single-channel than with multichannel brachytherapy (hazard ratio = 1.32; 95% CI 1.03-1.69, P=.03). Of noninfectious adverse events, 70.9% were seroma. Seroma significantly increased breast pain risk (P<.0001). Patients with underlying diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and treatment with chemotherapy had increased infectious and noninfectious adverse events. The 5-year incidences of fat necrosis, breast pain, and rib fracture were slightly higher after brachytherapy than after EBRT (13.7% vs 8.1%, 19.4% vs 16.0%, and 1.6% vs 1.3%, respectively), but the risks were not significantly different for multichannel versus single-channel applicators. CONCLUSION: Toxicities after breast brachytherapy were distinct from those after EBRT. Temporal toxicity trends may reflect changing technology and evolving practitioner experience with brachytherapy.",eng,1

The goal of this study was to examine how practice patterns changed following the guideline's release. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried from 2008 to 2010 for females aged >/=20 years receiving breast conservation via brachytherapy. Among the APBI cohort, characteristics and CS grouping (suitable,"" ""cautionary,"" or ""unsuitable"") of patients receiving APBI in the 18 months before (January 2008 to June 2009) and after (July 2009 to December 2010) guideline publication were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 87,528 patients undergoing breast conservation therapy were identified. Of this, 4,253 patients (4.9%) received brachytherapy-based APBI. Limiting the analysis to patients not missing data that would affect their CS classification rendered 3,828 patients. The proportion of breast conservation patients receiving brachytherapy-based APBI before and after CS release remained the same (4.9% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.36). Among patients receiving brachytherapy-based APBI, the unsuitable category decreased (15.8 vs. 11.1%, p < 0.01), whereas the suitable category increased (37.7% vs. 42.1%, p = 0.03), and the cautionary category was stable (46.5% vs. 46.7% p = 0.90) after guideline publication. Joinpoint regression analysis failed to reveal that the changes in practice patterns corresponded with the CS publication date. CONCLUSIONS: The period before and after publication of the ASTRO CS was associated with a decrease in ""unsuitable"" patients and an increase in ""suitable"" patients being treated with brachytherapy-based APBI.

Long-term data from early breast conservation trials has shown that most local failures occur in close proximity to the tumor bed. This has been observed in both radiated and unradiated breasts treated with breast conservation techniques, suggesting that occult multifocal disease is less ominous than once believed. Improvements in breast imaging and radiation treatment planning and delivery allow the experienced radiation oncologist to deliver high doses of radiation to the region of the tumor bed alone in less than 2 weeks. Preliminary data suggests that this abbreviated course of radiation offers cosmetic and disease control outcomes equal to that of traditional whole breast radiation in selected populations. This article reviews current techniques, outcomes of clinical trials, and novel techniques in partial breast radiation for early and locally recurrent breast carcinomas. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Although data on the long-term effectiveness and safety of APBI accelerated partial breast irradiation are still being gathered, the shorter treatment course and narrowed radiation target of APBI accelerated partial breast irradiation provide an attractive alternative for carefully selected patients. These patients include those with relatively small tumors (<3 cm), negative or close margins, and negative sentinel lymph nodes. Possible long-term complications include telangiectasia and the development of a palpable mass at the lumpectomy site. Mammographic findings in patients who have undergone APBI accelerated partial breast irradiation are distinct from those in patients who have undergone conventional WBI whole-breast irradiation . The most common post-APBI accelerated partial breast irradiation radiographic findings include formation of seromas at the lumpectomy site, focal parenchymal changes such as increased trabeculation and parenchymal distortion, fat necrosis, and skin changes such as thickening or retraction. Given the continued evolution of breast cancer treatment, it is important that radiologists have a comprehensive understanding of APBI accelerated partial breast irradiation in terms of rationale, patient selection criteria, common postprocedural radiographic findings (and how they differ from post-WBI whole-breast irradiation findings), and advantages and potential complications.

Templates were created in our treatment planning system for structures, isodose levels, optimization constraints, and plan report. This study reviews our first 20 high dose rate Contura breast treatment plans. We followed our standardized procedure for contouring, planning, and second checking. The established dose volume histogram criteria were successfully met for all plans.

Based on this analysis, more appropriate ranges for the total dwell time and balloon diameter tolerance were found. Three major problems were encountered: balloon migration toward the skin for small balloon-to-skin distances, lumen obstruction, and length change for the flexible balloon. Solutions were found for these issues and our standardized procedure and checklists were updated accordingly. Based on our review of these cases, the use of checklists resulted in consistent results, indicating good coverage for the target without sacrificing the critical structures.

Journal Article,H. Ikeda,1995.0,[Developments in brachytherapy],", ","Brachytherapy is one of the ideal methods of radiotherapy because of the concentration of a high dose on the target. Recent developments, including induction of afterloading method, utilization of small-sized high-activity sources such as Iridium-192, and induction of high technology and computerization, have made for shortening of irradiation time and source handling, which has led to easier management of the patient during treatment. Dose distribution at high dose rate (HDR) is at least as good as that of low dose rate (LDR), and selection of fractionation and treatment time assures even greater biological effects on hypoxic tumor cells than LDR. Experience with HDR brachytherapy in uterine cervix cancer using Cobalt-60 during the past 20 years in this country has gradually been evaluated in U.S. and Europe. The indications for HDR treatment have extended to esophagus, bronchus, bile duct, brain, intraoperative placement of source guide, and perineal region using templates, as well as the conventional use for uterus, tongue and so on.",jpn,0

A new technique to perform IORT was applied in 185 patients from July 1, 1999, to October 31, 2001. As the surgeon plays a crucial role in this procedure in selecting the patients, performing the breast resection, preparing the gland as a target to receive IORT, delivering the radiation directly to the mammary gland via a dedicated applicator, and, finally, reconstructing the breast, each phase of the surgical technique has been completely standardized and is described herein. The use of IORT in the conservative treatment of breast cancer could allow the course of external fractionated-dose radiation therapy to be completely avoided; IORT dramatically reduces radiation exposure of the skin, lung, and subcutaneous tissues and avoids the irradiation of the contralateral breast, which contributes to a very low incidence of radiation induced sequelae. In our experience, IORT for limited-stage breast carcinoma is easy to perform and only briefly prolongs the duration of the surgical procedure.",,0

Design: Retrospective case series. Setting: Division of breast surgery in a comprehensive cancer center. Patients: From June 1999 to September 2003 ELIOT was used as the sole radiotherapy in 355 patients with unifocal invasive carcinoma who were candidates for breast-conserving surgery and most of whom were participating in an ongoing institutional trial. In a group of patients in whom PFR was not considered safe or feasible (because of previous mantle field irradiation for Hodgkin disease, cosmetic breast augmentation, severe cardiopathy, large hypertrophic scarring from skin burns, vitiligo, and geographic or social obstacles), ELIOT was performed outside of the ongoing trial. Results: No particular adverse effects, unusual acute reactions, late sequelae, and local or systemic events were noted in these patients after a mean follow-up of 27.3 months. Conclusions: In appropriated selected patients, when it is critical to perform PFR after breast-conserving therapy, a single dose of ELIOT may be considered to avoid mastectomy, reduce potential treatment toxicity, improve quality of life, and resolve logistic problems. The long-term results of ongoing clinical trials will further delineate patients in whom ELIOT may replace PFR. ©2005 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",,1

Prior therapeutic radiation to the breast region is considered an absolute contraindication to breast conservative surgery, and mastectomy is considered the treatment of choice. We performed a retrospective review to assess the potential of performing breast conservative surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (ELIOT), in these patients. Methods and results: Forty-three patients affected by early breast cancer, previously treated with mantle radiation for malignant lymphoma, who underwent breast conservative surgery and ELIOT, were identified in our institution. Median age at diagnosis of lymphoma was 26 years (49% were less than 25). Median interval between lymphoma and breast cancer occurrence was 19 years. A total dose of 21 Gy (prescribed at 90% isodose) in 39 patients (91%), of 17 Gy (prescribed at 100% isodose) in 1 patient and 18 Gy (prescribed at 90% isodose), was delivered. ELIOT was well tolerated in all patients without any unusual acute or late reactions. After a median follow-up of 52 months, local recurrence occurred in 9% of the patients and metastases in 7% patients. Conclusion: In patients previously treated for lymphoma, partial breast irradiation, and in particular ELIOT, permits breast conservative surgery without acute local complications, decreasing the number of avoidable mastectomies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,0

The smaller dimensions of the sources are flexible for smaller diameter of the applicators and it is also suitable for interstitial implants. Presently, miniaturized (60)Co HDR sources have been made available with identical dimensions to those of (192)Ir sources. (60)Co sources have an advantage of longer half life while comparing with (192)Ir source. High dose rate brachytherapy sources with longer half life are logically pragmatic solution for developing country in economic point of view. This study is aimed to compare the TG-43U1 dosimetric parameters for new BEBIG (60)Co HDR and new microSelectron (192)Ir HDR sources. Dosimetric parameters are calculated using EGSnrc-based Monte Carlo simulation code accordance with the AAPM TG-43 formalism for microSlectron HDR (192)Ir v2 and new BEBIG (60)Co HDR sources. Air-kerma strength per unit source activity, calculated in dry air are 9.698x10(-8) +/- 0.55% U Bq(-1) and 3.039x10(-7) +/- 0.41% U Bq(-1) for the above mentioned two sources, respectively. The calculated dose rate constants per unit air-kerma strength in water medium are 1.116+/-0.12% cGy h(-1)U(-1) and 1.097+/-0.12% cGy h(-1)U(-1), respectively, for the two sources. The values of radial dose function for distances up to 1 cm and more than 22 cm for BEBIG (60)Co HDR source are higher than that of other source. The anisotropic values are sharply increased to the longitudinal sides of the BEBIG (60)Co source and the rise is comparatively sharper than that of the other source. Tissue dependence of the absorbed dose has been investigated with vacuum phantom for breast, compact bone, blood, lung, thyroid, soft tissue, testis, and muscle. No significant variation is noted at 5 cm of radial distance in this regard while comparing the two sources except for lung tissues. The true dose rates are calculated with considering photon as well as electron transport using appropriate cut-off energy. No significant advantages or disadvantages are found in dosimetric aspect comparing with two sources.",eng,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 126 cases of DCIS seen and treated with APBI using balloon-based brachytherapy constitute the study population. The median age at diagnosis was 59 years (range, 37-82) with 21% younger than age 50. Nuclear grade distribution was 52.5, 41.4, and 6.1% high, intermediate and low, respectively. Of these patients, 86% had estrogen receptor positive DCIS. The median tumor size was 6 mm (range, 1-26). Margins of excision were negative in 98.4% of patients. All patients were treated with 34 Gy in 10 fractions using either the MammoSite or Contura breast brachytherapy catheter. A total of 87 patients (73.1%) were placed on adjuvant tamoxifen or arimedex.

Materials: Between June 2004 and December 2006, 182 premenopausal women with a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer were treated with breast-conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy +- axillary dissection. During surgery, an electron intraoperative boost of 12 Gy was administered to the tumour bed. Median age was 41 years (24-48). Adjuvant local treatment was completed within 4 weeks by HEBRT consisting of 13 daily fractions of 2.85 Gy to the whole breast to a total dose of 37.05 Gy. Pathologic stages were as follow: stage I 84(46%), stage IIA 65 (36%) , stage IIB 17 (9%), stage IIIA 11 (6%), stage IIIC 3 (2%).13 patients (7.1%) were classified as triple negative"" ( estrogens and progesterone receptor negative and Cerb-B2 not expressed) . Adjuvant systemic treatment consisted of chemotherapy for 21 patients (11.5%), chemo and endocrine therapy for 64 patients (35.2%), endocrine treatment only for 94 (51.6%) while one patient (1%) did not receive any systemic treatment. In all cases, adjuvant chemotherapy was started after the completion of HEBRT. After the end of the treatment all patients underwent follow-up visits every 6 months with the breast surgeon Results: At a median follow-up of 51.6 months (range 27-74), 175 patients (96%) are alive and 158 (87%) are free from any recurrence. Two patients (1%) had nodal regional recurrence, 14 patients (8%) had distant metastasis (one died after diagnosis of liver metastasis). Two patients (1%) developed contralateral breast cancer. Four patients (2%) had a second cancer: (two rectal, one thyroid cancer and one died of a metastatic melanoma). Overall 19 recurrences (10%) were observed, none of them in the ipsilateral breast Conclusions: The intraoperative radiotherapy boost followed by HEBRT allows delivering a very high dose to the tumour bed plus a adequate dose to the whole breast in a short time. Preliminary results in terms of local control are promising.

Methods and Materials: Between June 2004 and March 2007, 211 women with a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer were treated with breast-conserving surgery. During surgery, an electron intraoperative therapy boost of 12 Gy was administered to the tumor bed. Adjuvant local treatment was completed with HEBRT, consisting of a course of 13 daily fractions of 2.85 Gy to the whole breast to a total dose of 37.05 Gy. Acute toxicity of the breast was evaluated at the end of HEBRT and at 1 month of follow-up. Late toxicity was recorded at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Results: We report the data from 204 patients. The maximal acute skin toxicity was observed at the end of HEBRT (182 patients evaluable) with 7 (3.8%) Grade 3, 52 (28.6%) Grade 2, 123 (67.6%) Grade 1, and no Grade 0 or Grade 4 cases. A total of 108 patients were evaluated for late toxicity. The recorded late skin toxicity was Grade 4 in 1 patient (0.9%), Grade 3 in 1 patient, and Grade 2 or less in 106 patients (98.2%). Conclusions: The results of this study have shown that electron intraoperative therapy followed by HEBRT allows for the delivery of a high dose to the tumor bed and an adequate dose to the whole breast. This treatment is feasible, compliance is high, and the rate of acute toxicity and the preliminary data on chronic toxicity seem acceptable. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,0

Xoft Axxent Electronic Brachytherapy (XB) is a form of portable, balloon-based APBI that utilizes an electronic source for kilovoltage irradiation delivery and has minimal shielding requirements. As such, XB becomes a logical and convenient modality for delivery of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). We report initial results and clinical outcomes of a trial that utilizes XB to deliver IORT for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Methods: Eleven patients were enrolled on an IRB-approved protocol. Inclusion criteria included patients >45 years of age, unifocal tumors with infiltrating ductal or DCIS histology, tumors ?3 cm, and uninvolved lymph nodes. Intraoperative ultrasound was used to verify a minimum 1 cm of balloon-to-skin distance, as well as to evaluate the conformance of the balloon to the surrounding breast tissue. A pliable lead shield was placed over the pectoralis fascia prior to delivery of radiation. Pre-loaded radiation plans for balloon inflation sizes of 40 cc to 70 cc were used to deliver radiation prescription dose of 20 Gy to the balloon surface. Results: The mean time for radiation delivery was 22 minutes and the total mean procedure time was 1 hour 39 minutes. The mean balloon-to-skin distance by ultrasound was 1.4 cm. All margins of excision were negative on final pathology. At a mean follow-up of 9 months, overall cosmesis was rated as excellent in 6 of 11 patients and good in the remaining 5. Three patients reported mild postoperative breast pain, 3 patients developed mild erythema of the skin, 1 patient developed grade 2 fibrosis, and 1 patient developed grade 1 fibrosis. To date, no infection, fat necrosis, desquamation, rib fracture, or cancer recurrence had been observed. Conclusions: IORT utilizing XB is emerging as a feasible, well-tolerated, and patient-friendly alternative to APBI. Further research and longer follow-up data on XB and other IORT methods is needed to establish clinical efficacy and safety on this treatment.",,0

The aim of the study is to analyze the results of BCT in these patients who undergo IORT using low energy X photons. Materials and Methods: Eighty five females with early invasive breast carcinoma, who had IORT during breast conserving surgery between December 2005 and March 2008 were included in the study. The followup time was at least 54 months (from 54 to 80; median was 63; mean 63.7 months). For the IORT, INTRABEAM PRS 500 system (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) was used, which generates low energy (<50kV) X-rays. 20 Gy dose was applied to the surface of the tumour bed. Two groups of patients were investigated: 1) IORT group (n = 19), where it was the only form of radiation therapy; 2) IORT plus EBRT (external beam radiotherapy) group (n = 61), where the whole breast irradiation with 50 Gy was delivered additionally. The analysis focused on early (RTOG/ EORTC scale) and late (LENT-SOMA scale) toxicity, long-term outcomes, and aesthetic effect. Results: Early complications occurred in 20% of patients, but there were no serious complications that would prolong hospitalisation. The most frequent early complications were: prolonged wound healing (20%), inflammation of the tumour bed (14.1%), and breast inflammation (7.1%). Early radiation toxicity was observed in 15.3% of patients. The most frequent (11.3%) late complication was grade 2 fibrosis limited to the treated quadrant, which were reasons for diagnostic difficulties in the follow-up period. In over 10% of patients the fibrosis was a reason for subsequent surgical re-intervention. The intensity of fibrosis decreased with the time from surgery. No grade 3 or 4 fibrosis was detected in a 48-month of follow-up. Fluid collections (seroma) were most frequently (37.7%) observed. In the IORT group, local recurrence was detected in one patient 40 months after the treatment. There were no local recurrences in the IORT plus EBRT group. Five-year overall and disease-specific survival was 100% in the IORT group, whereas 95.1% and 96.7% in the IORT plus EBRT group, respectively. Excellent and good aesthetic outcome was achieved in about 90% of patients. Conclusions: The IORT using INTRABEAM PRS 500 system with low energy 50 kV X-ray irradiation, combined with breast conserving surgery in early breast carcinoma, is a well-tolerated and safe method, with a low complication rate. It provides good local control in 5-year follow-up. This is an effective procedure that provides high survival rate and provides fine aesthetic effect.",,0

Thariat,2014.0,Management of choroidal metastases,10.1016/j.ctrv.2014.09.006,"BACKGROUND: Choroidal metastases (CM) are the most common malignant intraocular lesion observed in up to 4-12% of necropsy series of patients with solid cancer. The spectrum of presentations varies from prevalent CM in disseminated cancer to isolated CM. CM are responsible for visual deterioration. Depending on the primary cancer, estimated life expectancy, overall cancer presentation and ocular symptoms, the management of CM varies widely. We address the multidisciplinary management of CM and technical aspects of radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review of literature was performed from 1974 to 2014. RESULTS: Choroidal metastases occur preferentially in breast and lung carcinomas but are reported in all cancer types. The standard treatment remains external beam radiotherapy, applying 30Gy in 10 fractions or 40Gy in 20 fractions. The reported complete response and improved visual acuity rates are 80% and 57% to 89%, respectively. Some chemotherapy or new targeted therapy regimens yield promising CM response rates. DISCUSSION: Radiation therapy consistently shows rapid symptom alleviation, yield excellent local control and functional outcomes. However, there are only few reports on late toxicities after 6months given the unfavorable prognostic of CM patients. Selected patients may live more than two years, underlying the need to better assess mean and long term outcomes. Some authors have favored exclusive systemic strategies with omission of irradiation. The current literature suffers from the scarcity of prospective trials. Duration of tumor response following systemic therapy is rarely reported but appears less favorable as compared to radiotherapy. Systemic treatments may be proposed for pauci-symptomatic CM in a polymetastatic context while radiation therapy remains necessary in symptomatic CM either upfront or as an alternating treatment. Focalized radiation like brachytherapy and proton therapy may be proposed for isolated CM with long disease-free interval between primary and CM, as these techniques have the potential to yield better tumor and functional outcomes in patients with long life expectancy.",eng,0

Jassem,2010.0,Hypofractionated breast cancer protocols & partial breast irradiation techniques,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&AN=70321785","Radiotherapy (RT) plays an important role in the management of breast cancer. Several randomized trials and large metaanalyses clearly demonstrated that the local recurrence risk is significantly reduced by administering RT after both mastectomy and breast conserving surgery (BCS). Additionally, postoperative RT is associated with significant reduction of breast cancer mortality. It has been estimated that avoiding four local recurrences translates into the avoidance of one breast cancer death at 15 years follow-up. Since 1970s, the standard management of breast cancer is BCS followed by RT However, conventional RT after BCS requires 5 weeks of daily treatment, frequently followed by another 1-2 weeks to deliver a boost dose. In consequence, many women may opt for mastectomy in order to avoid the inconvenience associated with a prolonged treatment. Any treatment technique which reduces the overall treatment time without compromising its outcomes would therefore be welcome to clinicians, patients, and health policy makers. Within the past decade, two treatment techniques including reduced treatment time have emerged. The first is hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy (HERT) to the whole breast, and the second is accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)Within the last 20 years approximately 8000 patients have been enrolled in a series of large randomized trials comparing HERT (13-16 fractions using larger dose per fraction) with the current international standard of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The results published to date suggest that HERT provides local control rate, overall survival and cosmesis comparable to those obtained with standard fractionation. However, owing to a possibility of late side effects, final evaluation of this method would need follow-up data of another 10-15 years. For several decades, whole-breast irradiation (WBI) has been considered a standard method in Virtually all patients undergoing BCS. Over the past years, there has been growing interest in the use APBI as an alternative to WBI. With this method the treatment volume is limited to the area of the breast immediately around the lumpectomy site, thus the dose delivered to uninvolved portions of the breast and adjacent organs is substantially reduced. APBI may be accomplished by intraoperative low-energy x-rays, intraoperative electrons, balloon brachytherapy, seed brachytherapy or shortterm external-beam conformal RT With all these methods the overall time is shortened to mere 1-5 days. The main concern related to the use of APBI is the possibility of missing occult foci of cancer localized elsewhere in the breast. Several multicenter, randomized clinical trials inclUding around 16, 000 patients have been initiated to compare the effectiveness and safety of APBI and WBI, and their results have been awaited. As of now, therefore, APBI should be preferentially used only in the framework of clinical trials. However, the off-protocol use of APBI has markedly increased and there is an apparent need for setting stringent selection criteria for its application. According to a consensus statement of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Health Services Research Committee the most suitable group for the use of APBI outside the context of a clinical trials includes patients aged over 60 years, with unicentric tumor <2 em and no nodal involvement. Patients who choose treatment with APBI should be informed that this is a relatively new method with a limited track record, so its long-term effectiveness and safety are not fully known.",,0

The purpose of this analysis is to present 5- and 7-year outcomes following APBI based on CS groupings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 690 patients with early-stage breast cancer underwent APBI from 1993 to 2012, receiving interstitial brachytherapy (n=195), balloon-based brachytherapy (n=290), or 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (n=205) at a single institution. Patients were stratified into suitable, cautionary, and unsuitable groups with 5-year outcomes analyzed. Seven-year outcomes were analyzed for a subset with follow-up of >/=2 years (n=625). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 6.7 years (range, 0.1 to 20.1 y). Patients assigned to cautionary and unsuitable categories were more likely to have high-grade tumors (21% to 25% vs. 9%, P=0.001), receive chemotherapy (15% to 38% vs. 6%, P<0.001), and have close/positive margins (9% to 11% vs. 0%, P<0.001). There was no difference in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence at 5 or 7 years: 2.2%, 1.2%, 2.8% at 5 years (P=0.57), and 2.2%, 1.9%, 4.6% at 7 years (P=0.58) in the suitable, cautionary, and unsuitable groups, respectively. As compared with the suitable group, increased rates of distant metastases were noted for the unsuitable and cautionary groups at 5 years (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: No differences in rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence were seen at 5 or 7 years when stratified by ASTRO CS groupings. Modest increases in distant recurrence were noted in the cautionary and unsuitable groups. These findings suggest that the ASTRO CS groupings stratify more for systemic recurrence and may not appropriately select patients for whole versus partial breast irradiation.",Eng,0

DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized interventional trial. SETTING: A university hospital tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Five women with locally advanced invasive breast cancer, aged 38 to 66 years, who were undergoing surgical resection of their tumor. One patient underwent preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy, 3 patients received preoperative chemotherapy, and 1 had no preoperative therapy. All patients completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: While patients were under general anesthesia and just before surgical resection, a 15-gauge insulated multiple-needle electrode was inserted into the tumor under sonographic guidance. Radiofrequency energy was applied at a low power by a preset protocol for a period of up to 30 minutes. Only a portion of the tumor was treated to evaluate the zone of RF ablation and the margin between ablated and nonablated tissue. Immediately after RF ablation, the tumor was surgically resected (4 mastectomies, 1 lumpectomy). Pathologic analysis included hematoxylin-eosin staining and enzyme histochemical analysis of cell viability with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-diaphorase (NADH-diaphorase) staining of snap-frozen tissue to assess immediate cell death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cancer cell death as visualized on hematoxylin-eosin-stained paraffin section and NADH-diaphorase cell viability stains. RESULTS: There was evidence of cell death in all patients. Hematoxylin-eosin staining showed complete cell death in 2 patients. In 3 patients there was a heterogeneous pattern of necrotic and normal-appearing cells within the ablated tissue. The ablated zone extended around the RF electrode for a diameter of 0.8 to 1.8 cm. NADH-diaphorase cell viability stains of the ablated tissue showed complete cell death in 4 patients. The fifth patient had a single focus of viable cells (<1 mm) partially lining a cyst. There were no perioperative complications related to RF ablation. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative RF ablation results in invasive breast cancer cell death. Based on this initial report of the use of RF ablation in breast cancer, this technique merits further investigation as a percutaneous minimally invasive modality for the local treatment of breast cancer.",eng,0

At the Milford Regional Cancer Center, DIBH stability was maintained by visual alignment of inroom lasers and patient skin tattoos (TAT). At the South Shore Hospital, a distance-measuring laser device (RTSSD) was implemented. For both centers,cine EPID images were acquired at least once per week during beam-on. Chest wall position relative to image boundary was measured and tracked over the course of treatment for every patient and treatment fraction for which data were acquired. Results: Median intrabeam chest motion was 0.31 mm for the TAT method and 0.37 mm for the RTSSD method. The maximum excursions exceeded our treatment protocol threshold of 3 mm in 0.3% of cases (TAT) and 1.2% of cases (RTSSD).

We hypothesize that the use of APBI would continue to be well tolerated, associated with a good cosmetic outcome, and a low risk for recurrence for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Methods: From 2002-2004, 194 patients with DCIS were enrolled in a registry trial and deemed eligible for study to assess the use of APBI. Follow-up data was available for all 194 patients. Median follow-up was 52.2 months; 65 patients had at least 5 years of follow-up. Data obtained included patient, tumor and treatment related factors, recurrence incidence, device associated adverse events and cosmetic outcomes. Results: 2 patients (1%) had positive margins, 21(11%) had close margins and 171(88%) had negative margins at the completion of surgical therapy. 87 patients (45%) had the balloon brachytherapy applicator placed at time of lumpectomy; 107 patients (55%) had the device placed post-lumpectomy. In the first year of follow-up, 16 patients developed a breast infection; method of device placement was not associated with infection risk. 46 patients developed a seroma which was associated with applicator placement at the time of lumpectomy (p=0.001). Cosmesis was rated Excellent/Good versus Fair/Poor for >85% of each follow-up group annually for the past 5 years. Device to skin distance, method of device placement, infection and seroma were examined and were not associated with cosmetic outcome. 4 patients (2%) had an ipsilateral breast recurrence and 1(0.5%) had recurrence in the breast and axilla, with a 5-year actuarial local recurrence rate of 3.40%. Positive/close margins (p=0.01) and age <50 at diagnosis (p=0.009) were associated with risk for local recurrence. Conclusions: After additional follow-up time, APBI continues to be well tolerated for patients with DCIS. Utilization of APBI may make lumpectomy possible for some women who would otherwise choose mastectomy because of standard radiation therapy associated barriers.",,0

Anderson Cancer Center experience,", ","PURPOSE: To analyze the long-term outcome of breast conservation therapy in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in a single institution and to analyze the prognostic importance, if any, of young patient age. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The hospital records of 150 patients with DCIS treated with surgical excision and radiotherapy at our institution between 1980 and 1997 were retrospectively reviewed. For most of the patients, intraoperative specimen radiographs or postoperative mammograms were available for use in assessing that an adequate surgical resection had been performed. The median patient age was 53 years (range 32-81), with 13% of patients <or=40 years old. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 63 months, 12 patients had local disease recurrence. The actuarial rate of local recurrence-free survival at 5 and 10 years was 96% and 88%, respectively. Local recurrence correlated with nuclear grade (p = 0.002) but was not associated with patient age at diagnosis (<40 years vs. >or=40 years, p = 0.39). In all cases of local recurrence, patients underwent surgery with or without chemotherapy, and disease control was achieved.

On the basis of the excellent long-term local control and 100% disease-specific survival rates, we found that patient age does not affect the outcome if the margins are clear. Continued studies in young patients treated with breast conservative therapy for DCIS are needed.",eng,0

Fernandez-del Castillo,2000.0,Impact of laparoscopic staging in the treatment of pancreatic cancer,", ","HYPOTHESIS: Staging laparoscopy in patients with pancreatic cancer identifies unsuspected metastases, allows treatment selection, and helps predict survival. DESIGN: Inception cohort. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 125 consecutive patients with radiographic stage II to III pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent staging laparoscopy with peritoneal cytologic examination between July 1994 and November 1998. Seventy-eight proximal tumors and 47 distal tumors were localized. INTERVENTIONS: Based on the findings of spiral computed tomography (CT) and laparoscopy, patients were stratified into 3 groups. Group 1 patients had unsuspected metastases found at laparoscopy and were palliatedwithout further operation. Group 2 patients had no demonstrable metastases, but CT indicated unresectability due to vessel invasion. This group underwent external beam radiation with fluorouracil chemotherapy followed in selected cases by intraoperative radiation. Patients in group 3 had no metastases or definitive vessel invasion and were resection candidates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Survival. RESULTS: Staging laparoscopy revealed unsuspected metastases in 39 patients (31.2%), with 9 having positive cytologic test results as the only evidence of metastatic disease (group 1). Fifty-five patients (44.0%) had localized but unresectable carcinoma (group 2), of whom 2 (3.6%) did not tolerate treatment, 20 (36.4%) developed metastatic disease during treatment, and 21 (38.2%) received intraoperative radiation. Of 31 patients with potentially resectable tumors (group 3), resection for cure was performed in 23 (resectability rate, 74.2%). Median survival was 7.5 months for patients with metastatic disease, 10.5 months for those receiving chemoradiation, and 14.5 months for those who underwent tumor resection (P = .01 for group 2 vs. group 1; P<.001 for group 3 vs group 1). CONCLUSIONS: Staging laparoscopy, combined with spiral CT, allowed stratification of patients into 3 treatment groups that correlated with treatment opportunity and subsequent survival. Among the 125 patients, laparoscopy obviated 39 unnecessary operations and irradiation in patients with metastatic disease not detectable by CT. Laparoscopic staging can help focus aggressive treatment on patients with pancreatic cancer who might benefit.",eng,0

Furthermore, APBI offers decreased overall treatment time. APBI clinical application is implemented using different techniques such as brachytherapy, external beam and intraoperative radiotherapy. We have proposed an external beam technique, using modulated electron beams (MERT) with a reduced SSD, alone or in combination with modulated photon beams (IMRT), delivered by using the same photon multi-leaf collimator (xMLC). This technique has been already clinically implemented in supine position with success by our group. Now, we suggest prone positioning for ensuring the exclusion of significant normal tissue from the treatment fields (e.g. lung and heart). Also, the prone positioning of patients considerably reduces the breast tissue motion associated with breathing. We used a treatment planning system based on full Monte Carlo simulations, called CARMEN, developed by our group. The use of Monte Carlo has demonstrated an improved accuracy in dose calculation compared to other algorithms installed in any commercial TPS, especially in the case of the Pencil beam algorithm used for electron beam dose calculation. Materials and Methods: Prone positioning patients with breast lesions treated by conservative surgery and conventional whole breast irradiation were selected for retrospective APBI planning. Lumpectomy cavity, CTV, PTV and PTV-EVAL (PTV used for plan evaluation), as well as clinically relevant normal structures were contoured following the NSABP-B39/RTOG-0413 protocol. Dose prescription of 38.5 Gy in ten fractions (hypofractionation) and dose limitations for normal tissues were set following the more demanding limits in this protocol. For electrons beams, the potential gantry angles were evaluated in order to avoid collisions with a dedicated prone table (the prototype is named 'PRONO-MAMMI') specially designed for this study. Treatment plannings were calculated with the Monte Carlo planning system CARMEN, by using MERT+IMRT technique with the xMLC installed in a SIEMENS Primus linac. Results: Dose distributions achieved are presented on the left side of the figure. Comparison between the DVH of each calculated prone treatment (thick lines) and all treated supine cases (thin lines) are compared on the right side of the figure. Both techniques show similar acceptable PTV coverage. Ipsilateral breast and lung, heart and breast skin in prone position present lower dose than in supine cases. (Figure Presented) Conclusions: Our results are comparable or even better than those reported in scientific publications. Prone APBI treatment combining MERT+IMRT with a Monte Carlo treatment planning is showing excellent results, which encourage its clinical implementation.",,0

The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of imaging axillary specimens with x-ray (lymphogram) to determine the number of lymph nodes. We sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a lymphogram in identifying nodal positivity. METHODS: Patients who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) and axillary lymph node dissections (ALND) were prospectively accrued to this double-blinded, single-institution trial from December 2009 to January 2011. A single physician interpreted all lymphograms for the number of ALNs and positivity determined by size, spiculations, irregularities, and calcifications. RESULTS: Twenty female (age 50.8 +/- 14.3 years) patients were accrued to the study. The lymphogram located more lymph nodes compared with pathology in 11 of 16 cases (68.8%). In these 11 cases, lymphogram identified 170 nodes and the pathologist located 132 (77.6%). Of the 16 ALND specimens, 6 were from patients naive to chemotherapy and averaged 13.8 +/- 6.6 nodes; 10 were from neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients and had an average number of 14.9 +/- 7.4 nodes. In neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients, sensitivity of the lymphogram to detect nodal positivity was 91.7% and specificity was 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that lymphogram accurately identifies nodal count. This can be used for documentation of an adequate ALND for reimbursement. Furthermore, there may be potential value of lymphogram in intraoperative determination of nodal positivity.",eng,0

Bown,2004.0,Elastic scattering spectroscopy for intraoperative determination of sentinel lymph node status in the breast,10.1117/1.1802191,"The ability to provide the best treatment for breast cancer depends on establishing whether or not the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes under the arm. Conventional assessment requires tissue removal, preparation, and expert microscopic interpretation. In this study, elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS) is used to interrogate excised nodes with pulsed broadband illumination and collection of the backscattered light. Multiple spectra are taken from 139 excised nodes (53 containing cancer) in 68 patients, and spectral analysis is performed using a combination of principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to correlate the spectra with conventional histology. The data are divided into training and test sets. In test sets containing spectra from only normal nodes and nodes with complete replacement by cancer, ESS detects the spectra from cancerous nodes with 84% sensitivity and 91% specificity (per-spectrum analysis). In test sets that included normal nodes and nodes with partial as well as complete replacement by cancer, ESS detects the nodes with cancer with an average sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 89% (per-node analysis). These results are comparable to those from conventional touch imprint cytology and frozen section histology, but do not require an expert pathologist for interpretation. With automation of the technique, results could be made available almost instantaneously. ESS is a promising technique for the rapid, accurate, and straightforward detection of metastases in excised sentinel lymph nodes.",eng,0

Without the ability of MR imaging to localize the tumor margins and without the temperature-sensitive imaging that provides the closed-loop control of energy deposition, this method is inadequate for most clinical applications. Given these limitations,high-intensity focused ultrasound initially appeared to have a narrow application area and was not able to compete with other surgical or ablation methods. Today, MR imaging-guided FUS has become a safe and effective means of performing probe-delivered thermal ablations and minimally invasive surgery. Moreover, it has the potential to replace treatments that use ionizing radiation such as radiosurgery and brachytherapy. Although the cost of integratingbig ticket"" MR imaging systems with complex and expensive phased arrays is high, this expenditure will largely be offset by eliminating hospitalization and anesthesia and by reducing complications. In effect, an investment in this emerging technology will ultimately redound to the benefit of the health care delivery system and, most important, to the patient. The FUS system provides a safe, repeatable treatment approach for benign tumors (eg, uterine fibroid and breast fibroadenoma) that do not require an aggressive approach. MR-guided FUS can also be used for debulking cancerous tissue. It has already been tested as a breast cancer treatment; its application for other malignancies in the brain, liver, and prostate is under development. MR-guided FUS offers an attractive alternative to conventional surgery because it incorporates intraoperative MR imaging, which provides far more precise target definition than is possible with the surgeon's direct visualization of the lesion. MR-guided FUS is undeniably the most promising interventional MR imaging method in the field of image-guided therapy today. It is applicable not only in the thermal coagulative treatment of tumors but also in several other medical situations for which invasive surgery or radiation may not be treatment options. The use of FUS for treating vascular malformation or functional disorders of the brain is also exciting. It is uniquely applicable for image-guided therapy using targeted drug delivery methods and gene therapy. Further advances in this technology will no doubt improve energy deposition and reduce treatment times. In the near future, FUS will offer a viable alternative to conventional surgery and radiation therapy; in the longer-term, it may also enable a host of targeted treatment methods aimed at eradicating or arresting heretofore intractable diseases such as certain brain malignancies and forms of epilepsy.""",eng,0

The authors developed a resource-sensitive algorithm for selective acellular dermal matrix use with indications and contraindications based on body mass index, breast size, radiation therapy, flap vascularity, and pectoralis anatomy. METHODS: The algorithm incorporates preoperative and intraoperative decision points. Complication rates and aesthetic scores were compared for procedures performed before and after adoption of the algorithm. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the independent influence of the algorithm on postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-three breasts underwent reconstruction before and 179 underwent reconstruction after implementation of the algorithm. Overall complication rates did not differ between the cohorts (22.8 percent versus 20.7 percent; p=0.138). After adjusting for potential confounders, the algorithm did not significantly affect the incidence of infection, seroma, flap necrosis, explantation, or overall complications (all p>0.05). Aesthetic scores were not affected (2.75 of 4 versus 3.03 of 4; p=0.138). Acellular dermal matrix use decreased from 84 percent to 36 percent, resulting in a materials cost savings of $270,000 over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This algorithm obviated placement of acellular dermal matrix in an estimated 48 percent of immediate tissue-expander reconstructions. Patients treated after adoption of this algorithm experienced similar complication rates and aesthetic outcomes as those who underwent reconstruction before. The authors' preliminary outcomes demonstrate that evidence-based measures can be taken to selectively use acellular dermal matrix without a concomitant worsening of patient outcomes.

The hypothesis is that IORT will give a non-inferior risk of local recurrence (LR) compared with EBRT. It is unclear what LR risk patients and clinicians consider 'non-inferior'. In order to guide women and their doctors making choices about radiotherapy the TARGIT investigators in Western Australia designed a Patient Preference study to determine what increased risk of LR, without detriment to survival, women who have completed post-operative radiotherapy would accept, in return for the increased convenience and possibly decreased toxicity of IORT. Preferences of 30 women were determined by a scripted interview using validated trade-off methodology and visual aids. The preferences of 86 health professionals who treat breast cancer were collected by questionnaires. Of the patients, 50% were prepared to accept the maximum presented risk, a 5% increase in risk of LR (from 6% to 11 %) for the increased convenience of IORT. Only 20% required <1% increased risk of LR in order to accept IORT. In contrast, just 16% of health professionals accepted a 5% increase in risk of LR, while 35% required <1% increased risk and 6% would not consider IORT at all.

Thus, restriction of radiation therapy to the tumour bed during surgery might be adequate for selected patients. We compared targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) utilizing the Intrabeam Device, with conventional whole breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). IORT involves an x-ray source small enough to be placed inside a tumour bed to deliver its treatment. A series of applicators of varying diameters allows the correct size to be chosen for any surgical cavity after BCS. Low energy 50 kilovolt x-rays are produced which have limited penetration, so deliver a dose that is relatively high at the applicator surface but falls off rapidly with distance. We prescribe a dose of 20Gy at the applicator surface, given in a single treatment. The procedure lengthens theatre time by 20-30 minutes, but otherwise there are few logistical issues. Methods: Having safely piloted the technique of IORT, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SCGH) and the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute joined the international TARGIT-A trial in 2003. In this prospective, randomised, non-inferiority trial, women aged 45 years or older with invasive ductal breast carcinoma undergoing BCS were enrolled from 28 centres in nine countries. Participating centres were able to define stricter eligibility criteria, and the two Australian centres chose to include only post-menopausal women over 50 due to their lower risk of LR. Patients were randomly assigned to receive targeted IORT or EBRT. Postoperative discovery of predefined factors (eg, lobular carcinoma) could trigger addition of EBRT to IORT (in an expected 15% of patients). The primary outcome was LR in the conserved breast. The predefined non-inferiority margin was an absolute difference of 2.5% in the primary endpoint. Findings: 387 patients have been registered on the trial in Australia. Analysis of the first 1113 patients randomly allocated to IORT and 1119 allocated to EBRT was performed in early 2010. Of 996 patients who received the allocated treatment in the IORT group, 854 (86%) received IORT only and 142 (14%) received IORT plus EBRT. 1025 (92%) patients in the EBRT group received the allocated treatment. At 4 years, there were six LRs in the IORT group and five in the EBRT group. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of LR in the conserved breast at 4 years was 1.20% (95% CI 0.53-2.71) in the IORT group and 0.95% (0.39-2.31) in the EBRT group. The frequency of any complications and major toxicity was similar in the two groups. Radiotherapy toxicity (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3) was lower in the IORT group (six patients [0.5%]) than in the EBRT group (23 patients [2.1%]; p=0.002). Recent blinded analysis has shown no significant change in LR for the total cohort. A further unblinded analysis is planned for late 2012. Recruitment is ongoing as it was continued beyond the initial target to allow further centres to join the trial. Long term follow-up is planned. Interpretation: In accordance to ASCO literature and discussion with the data monitoring and safety committee and local specialists, IORT is now considered a standard treatment option for women over 70 with low risk disease in Western Australia.",,0

Methods: Thirty-five patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery received targeted tumour bed irradiation consisting of 5 Gy (at 10 mm) in a single fraction. This single intraoperative treatment was used to replace the external beam radiotherapy 'boost' that would usually be given in 10 daily treatments following 5 weeks of whole breast irradiation. Patients later completed external beam radiotherapy as usual. Potential toxicities were prospectively assessed fortnightly prior to external beam radiotherapy, weekly during it, and 3 monthly subsequently. Results: The intraoperative radiotherapy was able to be delivered without difficulty, either at time of initial cancer surgery or as a second procedure. When performed as a separate procedure the median operating time was 56 min. The treatment was well tolerated, with only one patient experiencing any grade 3 or 4 toxicities - this was acute grade three itch. There was an overall early breast infection rate of 17%. No unexpected toxicities were seen. Conclusions: This simple and well-tolerated treatment delivers a useful radiation dose to the area of highest risk of tumour recurrence. The early infection rate is similar to that reported in the literature, for treatments without intraoperative radiotherapy.

Conventional external radiotherapy delivers a total dose of 45 to 50 Gy in 1.8 to 2Gy/fraction over 5 to 6 weeks +/- boost to tumour bed of 10 to 16 Gy over 1 to 2 weeks. Advances in breast cancer radiobiology such that a more precise estimation of biological equivalent dose, and improvement in radiotherapy delivery technology with better dose homogeneity in the target volume resulted in the increasing use of hypofractionated scheme (i.e. larger daily fraction dose) to shorten overall treatment time. Recently, there were clinical trials comparing the delivery of radiobiologically-equivalent total dose using the hypofractionated scheme with overall shortened treatment time, with conventional 1.8 to 2 Gy daily fraction scheme. These trials showed equivalent locoregional recurrence rate, disease-free survival and overall survival without significant increase in acute and late toxicities, including late breast cosmetic complications. Concerns were raised as these trials included mainly low risk, elderly patients treated by breast conservative surgery without chemotherapy such that generalisation to all patients may not be appropriate. Also, the optimal hypo-fractionated schedule remains to be defined. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) greatly reduced the overall treatment time of breast radiotherapy. Intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT) employing single fraction treatment given during operation is particularly appealing as the treatment is convenient, fast with good sparing of normal structures. However, due to the lack of long-term follow-up data, APBI is considered not a standard option and should be performed in a clinical trial setting.",,0

One advantage of the intraoperative radiation therapy is surgery is used to directly irradiate the tumor bed. Thus, in one day performing surgery the tumor and radiotherapy administered more effectively, preserving healthy surrounding structures with the same therapeutic control.

Development of a technique and initial experience,", ","BACKGROUND: A new technique of endoscopic axillary lymphadenectomy without prior liposuction was developed by our group. METHOD: A total of 33 patients with early stage breast cancer were treated by breast-conserving therapy and endoscopic axillary lymphadenectomy. RESULTS: The median duration of the operation was 74.9 min (range, 30-130). Operation time was significantly shorter for the last 17 patients (p < 0.05) than for the first 16 patients. There were no intraoperative complications. The median number of removed lymph nodes was 14.5 (range, 2-28). Postoperatively three patients developed a seroma, one of which required evacuation. At postoperative day 5, arm mobility was unrestricted in 26 patients (78.7%); nine patients (27.2%) reported a loss of sensation in the outer side of the upper arm related to dermatome C5. One patient developed a temporary alar scapula, and one patient developed an axillary abscess 9 weeks after axillary lymphadenectomy during radiation therapy. After a median follow-up of 4.6 months seven patients reported persistent impairment of sensation, but all patients had regained full shoulder mobility.

METHODS: We analyzed 45 patients who were treated, between 2009-2010, with whole breast radiation (WBRT) followed by a tumor bed boost in the lateral decubitius position. Tumor bed volume, distance from skin to the maximal depth of the tumor bed, D90 (dose covering 90% of the tumor bed volume), maximal dose, electron energy and doses to heart and lungs were compared. Additional variables of body mass index (BMI) and tumor bed location were also analyzed to see if there was a benefit limited to any subgroup. RESULTS: Median BMI for the 45 patients treated was 30.6 (20.6-42.4). When comparing the supine scan to the lateral decubitus scan, there was no significant difference in the tumor bed volume (p = 0.116). There was a significant difference between depth to the tumor bed in the supine scan and lateral decubitus scan (p < 0.001). The mean maximum doses and D90 between the two scans were 110.7 (100.0-133.0)% vs 106.1 (95.1-116.9)% (p < 0.05) and 93.9 (81.3-01.0-101.0)% vs. 98.2 (89.1-108.0)% (p = 0.004) respectively. There was no difference in dose delivered to the lungs or heart between the two scans (p = 0.848 and p = 0.992 respectively). On subset analysis, there was a difference in depth to tumor that was seen across all BMI classes, including normal (p </= 0.001, overweight (p </= 0.001) and obese (p </= 0.001). The majority of patients had a tumor in the upper outer quadrant (77.8%) and on subset analysis, there was a significant difference in tumor bed volume (p < 0.01), depth to tumor (p < 0.01), tumor bed coverage [D90] (p < 0.05), maximum dose (p < 0.05) and energy (p < 0.001) for this location. CONCLUSIONS: Delivering a tumor bed boost in the lateral decubitus position reduces the distance to the tumor bed allowing for a lower energy treatment to be used to treat breast cancer. It improves coverage and decreases maximal dose to the target volume, all of which would help reduce skin morbidities and should be considered for patients with upper outer quadrant disease, irrespective of BMI status.",eng,0

We sought to determine the sociodemographic, pathologic, and therapeutic variables that were associated with CALND. METHODS: From 7/1997 to 7/2003, 1,470 patients with invasive breast cancer were SLN positive by intraoperative frozen section or final pathologic exam by hematoxylin-eosin and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC). A comorbidity score was assigned using Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 system. Fisher's exact, Wilcoxon tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used. RESULTS: CALND was performed less often in patients with age >or= 70 years compared with age < 70 years, moderate or severe comorbidities compared with no or mild, IHC-only positive SLN and breast conservation therapy (BCT compared with mastectomy. Patients who did not undergo CALND were less likely than CALND patients to have grade III disease, lymphovascular invasion multifocal disease, tumor size > 2 cm or to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. However, they were more likely to undergo axillary radiotherapy (RT). On multivariate analysis, age >or= 70 years [odds ratio (OR) 0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26-0.63], IHC-only positive SLN (OR 0.13, 95%CI 0.09-0.19), presence of moderate to severe comorbidities (OR 0.64, 95%CI 0.41-0.99), tumor size <or= 2 cm (OR 0.44, 95%CI 0.29-0.66), axillary RT (OR 0.39, 95%CI 0.20-0.78), and BCT (OR 0.54, 95%CI 0.37-0.79) were all independently associated with lower odds of CALND. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to perform CALND following positive SLN biopsy was multifactorial. Patient factors were a primary determinant for the use of CALND in our study. The decreased use of CALND in the BCT patients probably reflects reliance on the radiotherapy tangents to maintain local control in the axilla.",eng,0

METHODS: This was a prospective, observational cohort study conducted from January 2009 to July 2011. Breast cancer patients, diagnosed via biopsy, were operated in guidance with either ultrasound or palpation. Patient demographics, tumor features, intraoperative findings, pathologic and cosmetic results, intraoperative-measured ultrasound margins, and pathology margins were compared. RESULTS: Ultrasound (US)-guided lumpectomy was performed on 84 women and palpation-guided lumpectomy on 80 women. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics showed no differences. The rate of re-excision was 17 % for the palpation-guided surgery group, and 6 % for the US-guided group (p = 0.03). There was good correlation between the closest margins recorded by US and pathology margins (r = 0.76, p = 0.01). Volume of resection was significantly larger in the palpation-guided group despite the similar size of tumors (p = 0.048). Cosmetic outcome of surgery was equivalent between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative ultrasound guidance for excision of palpable breast cancers is feasible and gives results in terms of pathologic margins that are comparable with those achieved by standard palpation-guided excisions.",eng,0

However, five or more weeks of radiotherapy is a burden to the patient. Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) is an alternative to whole breast irradiation in patients with low-risk tumor, based on four randomized trials and more than 40 prospective trials. APBI focuses radiation on a 1 to 2 cm margin of tissue surrounding lumpectomy cavity. The rationale based on the majority of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) occurred around lumpectomy cavity. In 2009, the American Society of Radiation Oncology presented a consensus statement for APBI. In this consensus statement, not only an APBI-suitable group but also an APBI-cautionary group and an APBI-unsuitable group are shown. According to this guideline, age 60 and over, negative BRCA1/2 variation, 2 cm or less tumor (T1), lymph vascular space invasion negative, estrogen receptor (ER) positive, unicentric tumor, invasive ductal or other favorable histology, without extensive intraductal component (EIC), pN0 are suitable for APBI. Patients aged 50-59 years were included in the 'cautionary' group in 2009 guideline, but patients in this age has come to be in a suitable group in recent years. Multiple treatment modalities have been used to deliver APBI, including brachytherapy, intraoperative irradiation (x-ray or electron), and external beam radiotherapy with photon or particle radiotherapy. Multi-catheter interstitial brachy-therapy technique has a longest follow-up in APBI technique and has most trustful data. But this technique needs procedures skilled. In RTOG 95-17 study, the 10-year rate of IBTR was 6.2%. Investigators at the National Institute of Oncology in Hungary have presented the rates of recurrence were not significantly different between APBI vs WBI (5.9% vs 5.1%). Single-entry brachy therapy catheters are simpler for physicians and physicists and less invasive for patients. In United State, Ma mmo Site, Strut Assisted Volume Implant (SAVITM) and ConturaTM MLB were approved. The American Society of Breast Surgeons has reported a 5-year actuarial IBTR rate of 3.8% with Ma mmoSite. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) has been investigated primarily in Europe. The Targeted Intra-Operative Radiotherapy (TARGIT-A) trial had compared IORT and external beam whole breast irradiation (WBI). The 4 years IBTR rate was equal in the two arms. External beam irradiation using X-ray has been most widely used, which can be delivered non invasively, using the standard linear accelerator. The RTOG 03-19 reported a 4-year IBTR rate of 6%. Proton beam radiotherapy has been used in limited number of institutes. Adaptation of APBI will become more common based on several studies.",,0
Journal Article,Y. Kasai; H. Yokomise,2014.0,[Infrared thoracoscopy],", ","Infrared thoracoscopy with indocyanine green (ICG) is a new method of evaluating lung perfusion. We succeeded in visualizing lung emphysematous lesions and intersegmental borders using infrared thoracoscopy with ICG in animals, and within clinical investigations. There are 2 methods in infrared thoracoscopy. One is the 2-wavelength method, and the other is the 1-wavelength method. The 2- wavelength method is based on ICG absorption, and the 1-wavelength method is based on ICG fluorescence. The 2-wavelength method is superior for the clarity of images. On the other hand, the 1-wavelength method is superior for the duration of staining and the dose of ICG. Commonly, the inflation and deflation line has been used to identify the intersegmental border, but lung reinflation narrows the surgical view and can lead to prolongation of operation time, particularly in the context of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Infrared thoracoscopy with ICG is based on blood flow rather than on ventilation and can thus achieve anatomical segmentectomy without lung reinflation.

The procedure is safe in selected cases; including invasive tumours < 5 cm, multi-centric tumours, ductal carcinoma in situ and for risk-reduction surgery. Inflammatory breast cancers and tumours with extensive involvement of the skin represent contra-indications to SSM due to an unacceptable risk of local recurrence. Prior breast irradiation or the need for post-mastectomy radiotherapy do not preclude SSM, however the aesthetic outcome may be compromised. Preservation of the nipple areola complex is safe for peripherally located node negative tumours. An intraoperative frozen section protocol for the retro-areolar tissue should be considered in these cases. The advent of acellular tissue matrix systems has enhanced the scope of implant-based immediate reconstruction following SSM. Cell-assisted fat transfer is emerging as a promising technique to optimise the aesthetic outcome.",eng,0

The radiopaque material helps visualizing the balloon contour, catheter, and source position within the balloon, which is essential for computerized tomography-based treatment planning and for daily QA using x-ray radiographs. Because of the high content of iodine in contrast media, increased absorption and attenuation of photons may take place within the balloon, which would affect the resultant dose rates outside the balloon. The impact of the concentration of the radiopaque solution on the physical dosimetry of this brachytherapy procedure is investigated in this study using MCNPX (version 2.4) Monte Carlo simulation. Calculations were based on a 30 cm diameter water sphere phantom. The source geometry was that of the Nucletron microSelectron HDR v2 192Ir source. Concentration of the iodine-based radiopaque solution was varied from 5% to 25% by volume, a range recommended by the balloon's manufacturer. Balloon diameters of 4, 5, and 6 cm were simulated. Dose rate per unit air-kerma strength was calculated in 1 mm scoring bin steps. The dose rate reduction at the typical prescription line of 1 cm away from the balloon surface ranged from - 0.8% for the smallest balloon diameter and contrast concentration to a maximum of - 5.7% for the largest balloon diameter and contrast concentration, relative to a water-filled balloon. Limiting the contrast concentration to 10% would insure less than 3% reduction in the prescription dose, regardless of balloon diameter.",eng,0

Strom,2006.0,Dose modification factors for 192Ir high-dose-rate irradiation using Monte Carlo simulation,", ","A recently introduced brachytherapy system for partial breast irradiation, MammoSite, consists of a balloon applicator filled with contrast solution and a catheter for insertion of an 192Ir high-dose-rate (HDR) source. In using this system, the treatment dose is typically prescribed to be delivered 1 cm from the balloon's surface. Most treatment-planning systems currently in use for brachytherapy procedures use water-based dosimetry with no correction for heterogeneity. Therefore, these systems assume that full scatter exists regardless of the amount of tissue beyond the prescription line. This assumption might not be a reasonable one, especially when the tissue beyond the prescription line is thin. In such a case, the resulting limited scatter could cause an underdose to be delivered along the prescription line. We used Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how the thickness of the tissue between the surface of the balloon and the skin or lung affected the treatment dose delivery. Calculations were based on a spherical water phantom with a diameter of 30 cm and balloons with diameters of 4 cm, 5 cm, and 6 cm. The dose modification factor is defined as the ratio of the dose rate at the typical prescription distance of 1 cm from the balloon's surface with full scatter obtained using the water phantom to the dose rate with a finite tissue thickness (from 0 cm to 10 cm) beyond the prescription line. The dose modification factor was found to be dependent on the balloon diameter and was 1.098 for the 4-cm balloon and 1.132 for the 6-cm balloon with no tissue beyond the prescription distance at the breast-skin interface. The dose modification factor at the breast-lung interface was 1.067 for the 4-cm balloon and 1.096 for the 6-cm balloon. Even 5 cm of tissue beyond the prescription distance could not result in full scatter. Thus, we found that considering the effect of diminished scatter is important to accurate dosimetry. Not accounting for the dose modification factor may result in delivering a lower dose than is prescribed.",eng,0

Nakagawa,2004.0,Pathological approach to breast conserving therapy,", ","There is no uniformly accepted definition of a positive margin in breast conserving surgery. In 1999, the Japanese Breast Cancer Society created the Guidelines for Breast-Conserving Treatment (GBCT). At that time, we did a questionnaire survey about the definition of margin status. Although 57.1% of hospitals/institutes used the definition of cancer cells present at the surface, the GBCT adopted the definition of cancer cells present within 5 mm of the surface. Moreover, the GBCT required that the distance between the edge of the cancer cells and the surface be recorded in millimeters when cancer cells were present within 5 mm of the surface. The risk factors for local recurrence after breast-conserving treatment were studied. From 1986 to 1995, 391 patients were treated with breast-conserving surgery at Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases. Of these, 35 patients developed local recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed that positive margin (p=0.0002), high degree of ductal proliferative change around the tumor (p=0.0035) and high histological grade (p=0.0041) were significant independent risk factors for local recurrence, while radiation therapy (p=0.0327) significantly reduced local recurrence. There was no significant difference in the risk of local recurrence between the two different definitions of positive margin (tumor present at the surface and tumor present within 5 mm from the surface). It is hoped that more hospitals/institutes will adopt the definition of margin positivity presented by the GBCT and that a practical definition of margin positivity will be established.",eng,0

Advances have been made in imaging diagnostics as well as the implementation of nationwide screening programmes. Nowadays, we talk about prevention as well as treatment. Pathology has moved from pure morphology (tumour type, grade and stage) to biological characterisation of the tumour. Treatment has changed considerably through a better understanding of the disease; from a local disease predominated by extensive and mutilating surgical techniques to a point where breast cancer has come into its own as a systemic disease with equal rights"" to local as well as systemic treatment. This paradigm shift has led to a multidisciplinary approach of the understanding and treatment of breast cancer. Molecular classification has changed the understanding of breast cancer and will be the basis for an even more individualised treatment. New (biological) agents will help to further tailor treatment to response or resistance. While systemic treatment has been increased in number and duration surgical/local strategies have been reduced to minimum.

We initiated a prospective phase I/II clinical trial of IORT in Japan in 2007, and herein, we report the 5-year follow-up results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following inclusion criteria were used for enrollment in the trial: (1) tumor size < 2.5 cm, (2) desire for breast-conserving surgery, (3) age >50 years, and (4) negative margins after resection. In February 2009, the eligibility criteria were changed to include only patients with sentinel lymph node-negative disease. In phase I, the radiotherapy dose was escalated from 19 Gy/fr to 21 Gy/fr, incremented by 1 Gy per step, with 3 patients in each step. Doses were escalated after all patients in the preceding cohort had completed treatment and exhibited only grade 1 or 2 toxicities at a given dose level. The recommended phase II dose was set at 21 Gy at 90 % isodose. The primary endpoint was early toxicity. Secondary endpoints were long-term efficacy and late toxicity. In addition, Hypertrophic scarring was evaluated retrospectively as a cosmetic outcome by a radiation oncologist. RESULTS: Between December 2007 and March 2010, 32 women with breast cancer were enrolled in the trial. The median age was 65 years (51-80 years), and the median follow-up time was 6 years. No recurrence or metastasis was observed in any patient. Grade 2 fibrosis was detected in 3 patients as an acute adverse event and in 2 patients as a late adverse event. Ten patients developed a hypertrophic scar 1 year after the IORT; the number of patients decreased to 7 in the 3 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: The first group of female Asian patients tolerated the treatment with IORT in this Phase I/II study and remained recurrence-free for more than 5 years after treatment. However, 24 % of the patients developed hypertrophic scarring, an event that is being further examined in our ongoing multi-center Phase II trial of IORT for early breast cancer.",eng,1

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy patients were enrolled in a multicenter prospective trial testing the applicator for safety and performance. Fifty-four patients were implanted, and 43 patients were ultimately eligible for and received brachytherapy as the sole radiation modality after lumpectomy. Patients were staged T1N0M0 with negative pathologic margins and age >45 years. A dose of 34 Gy was delivered in 10 fractions over 5 days prescribed to 1 cm from the applicator surface using 192Ir high-dose-rate brachytherapy. A minimum skin-to-balloon surface distance of 5 mm was required for treatment. Device performance, complications, and cosmesis were assessed. RESULTS: Computed tomography imaging post-balloon inflation showed 8, 14, and 21 patients with 5-6 mm, 7-9 mm, and >10 mm of skin spacing, respectively. Two patients were explanted because of inadequate skin spacing and 7 because of suboptimal conformance of the surgical cavity to the applicator balloon. One patient was explanted because of positive nodal status and another because of age. The most common side effects related to device placement included mild erythema, drainage, pain, and echymosis. No severe side effects related to implantation, brachytherapy, or explantation occurred. Side effects related to radiation therapy were generally mild with erythema, pain, and dry desquamation being the most common. At 1 month, 88% of patients were evaluated as having good-to-excellent cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS: The MammoSite balloon breast brachytherapy applicator performed well clinically. All eligible patients completed treatment. Side effects were mild to moderate and self-limiting. Skin-balloon surface distance and balloon-cavity conformance were the main factors limiting the initial use of the device.",eng,0

Materials/Methods: Twenty balloon brachytherapy cases (MS) were replanned using both the MS and MS ML catheter configuration. Patients had skin spacing as low as 3mm (range, 3-19 mm) and rib/chestwall spacing as low as 3mm(range, 3-27 mm). CTbased 3D planning with dose optimization was completed for single-dwell (SD), multi-dwell single lumen (MD) and multiple lumen (ML) designs. Endpoints analyzed included: (1) percentage of the prescribed dose (PD) covering the planning target volume (PTV), (2) maximum skin dose as a percentage of the PD, (3) maximum rib dose as a percentage of the PD, (4) the V150 and V200, and the Dose Homogeneity Index (DHI). Results: The median maximum skin dose (% of the PD) was 89.1%, 88.8%, and 84.5% for the SD, MD, andMLplans. The median maximum rib dose (% of the PD) was 105.4%, 99.7%, and 98.2% for the SD, MD, and ML plans. The median % of the PD to 90% of the PTV-Eval was 101.3%, 101.0% and 100.6% and to 95% of the PTV-Eval was 95.5%, 96.4% and 96.3% for the SD, MD, andMLplans respectively. The median V150 and V200 were 29.4%, 27.4% and 26.1% and 5.7%, 5.1% and 4.3%, for the SD, MD, and ML plans respectively. Dose Homogeneity Index was 0.627, 0.654, and 0.670 respectively. All cases easily met or exceeded dosimetric goals established in the NSABP B39/RTOG 0413 protocol, regardless of skin or rib spacing. Despite the small cases number and the relatively small numerical improvements in these optimally planned cases, statistically significant dosimetric improvements were seen in all endpoints tested when using a multilumenMSover a single lumen design whether planned with a single dwell position or multiple dwell positions in the single lumen device (excepting D<sup>95</sup>). Conclusions: The MS ML catheter provides improved dosimetric capabilities (e.g., concurrently low skin and rib doses with improved PTV coverage and dose homogeneity) in most clinical scenarios.",,0

Our aim was to observe the long-term local recurrence rates and disease-free survival of our cohort and record adverse reactions to the therapy. Methods: Between April 2000 and April 2003, we enrolled patients with Tis, T1, and T2 clinically node-negative breast cancers who were undergoing breast conservation into an IRB-approved observational study of intraoperative radiotherapy, using the Intrabeam radiation system, combined with postoperative whole-breast radiation. The intraoperative radiation supplanted the use of postoperative boost during whole-breast radiation. Patients were scheduled for follow-up every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter. Breast cancer status and adverse reactions, as classified by RTOG/EORTC grading system, were recorded. Results: We enrolled 59 patients with 60 breast cancers and a median age of 59 (ages, 38-87); 35.6% had stage 2 disease. Our median follow-up time was 84 months during which time we had 3 (5.1%) systemic recurrences (2 at 12 months and 1 at 21 months) and 5 (8.3%) breast recurrences (at 32, 43, 69, 70, and 88 months). Two of the breast recurrences occurred in different area of the breast from the original tumor and greater than 5 years after the primary excision. The disease-free survival was 86.4%. Five patients had positive margins requiring re-excision after IORT, including 1 mastectomy. None of these patients developed a recurrence. We noted grade 1 adverse reactions in 8 patients, grade 2 in 8 patients, and 1 patient with a grade 3 reaction. Post-op radiation was omitted in 4 patients and none of these patients recurred. Conclusions: We have determined that IORT combined with post-op whole-breast radiation can be a safe and effective adjuvant treatment for breast cancer treated by breast conservation. Our recurrence and disease-free survival rates compare favorably to most of the prospective randomized trials of breast conservation with radiotherapy. It has the benefit of decreasing the time required for postoperative whole-breast irradiation from approximately 61/2 weeks to 5 weeks. IORT improves on the accuracy of the boost treatment, provided in a more timely fashion. We anxiously await the results of the TARGIT international trial to see if IORT with Intrabeam may be all the adjuvant radiotherapy required in selected patient populations.",,0

Mahadevan-Jansen,2010.0,Autofluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and spectral imaging for breast surgical margin analysis,10.1002/lsm.20865,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Most women with early stage breast cancer have the option of breast conserving therapy, which involves a partial mastectomy for removal of the primary tumor, usually followed by radiotherapy. The presence of tumor at or near the margin is strongly correlated with the risk of local tumor recurrence, so there is a need for a non-invasive, real-time tool to evaluate margin status. This study examined the use of autofluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and spectral imaging to evaluate margin status intraoperatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spectral measurements were taken from the surface of the tissue mass immediately following removal during partial mastectomies and/or from tissues immediately after sectioning by surgical pathology. A total of 145 normal spectra were obtained from 28 patients, and 34 tumor spectra were obtained from 12 patients. RESULTS: After correlation with histopathology, a multivariate statistical algorithm classified the spectra as normal (negative margins) or tumor (positive margins) with 85% sensitivity and 96% specificity. A separate algorithm achieved 100% classification between neo-adjuvant chemotherapy-treated tissues and non-treated tissues. Fluorescence and reflectance-based spectral images were able to demarcate a calcified lesion on the surface of a resected specimen as well. CONCLUSION: Fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy could be a valuable tool for examining the superficial margin status of excised breast tumor specimens, particularly in the form of spectral imaging to examine entire margins in a single acquisition.",eng,0

Afifi,2015.0,Free flap monitoring using an implantable anastomotic venous flow coupler: Analysis of 119 consecutive abdominal-based free flaps for breast reconstruction,10.1002/micr.22341,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the venous anastomotic Flow Coupler in monitoring free flaps used for breast reconstruction in a consecutive series of patients. METHODS: Retrospective data were collected on patients undergoing free flap breast reconstruction from May 2012 to March 2014. The venous anastomotic Flow Coupler was used in the first 85 flaps and a non-flow Coupler with clinical and external Doppler monitoring alone in the subsequent 34 flaps. Data collected included patient age, BMI, prior radiation, flap type, intra- and postoperative Flow Coupler events, along with rates of flap take back, salvage, and failure. Proportion data were compiled and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen consecutive abdominal based breast reconstruction free flaps were performed. The overall flap failure rate was 4.2% (4.7% Flow Coupler; 2.9% in non-flow Coupler; P = 1.0). The Flow Coupler demonstrated 100% sensitivity in the intra- and postoperative settings. A positive predictive value of 36% was noted intraoperatively which was significantly higher compared to the non-flow Coupler group (P = 0.015). Vessel thrombosis occurred in 17.6% of Flow Coupler flaps, which was significantly higher when compared to the non-flow Coupler (2.9%; P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The Flow Coupler is a sensitive method to confirm patency of a microsurgical anastomosis. However, there is a high false positive rate in both the intraoperative and postoperative settings resulting in frequent intraoperative maneuvers to amend the cause of signal loss. Additionally, the Flow Coupler resulted in significantly more vascular thrombotic events when compared to the non-flow Coupler.",eng,0

The primary endpoint is local recurrence. Some patients were unsuitable for inclusion in our trial for a number of reasons and were given IORT as a single treatment off-trial. Materials and Methods: Patients with invasive breast cancer underwent wide local excision followed by IORT (n = 74). Low energy x-rays are emitted from a point source, delivering a dose of radiation (~20 Gy at the surface and ~5Gy at 1 cm) directly to the tumour bed. The women could then proceed to have chemotherapy and/or adjuvant hormonal therapy as required. In addition, patients who were deemed unfit for surgery (n= 3) received interstitial radiotherapy alone under local anaesthetic. Women were followed-up for local recurrence. Results: Over the past 7 years in centres in 3 countries (UK, Germany and Australia), 77 patients have been treated in this way, with median age of 66 (56-77 IQR) years and a median follow-up of 37 (25-54 IQR) months.

A total of 342 patients were assessed, all over 50 years old with a median age at baseline of 64 years (IQR 59 to 68). The BCCT.core scores were dichotomised into Excellent and Good (EG), and Fair and Poor (FP). There were statistically significant increases in the odds of having an outcome of EG for patients in the TARGIT group compared with the EBRT group at year 1 (OR = 2.07, 95%CI 1.12 to 3.85, p = 0.021) and year 2 (OR = 2.11, 95%CI 1.0 to 4.45, p = 0.05).

The main outcome measure is risk of local relapse within the treated breast. We report here the one-year data from a sub-protocol assessing cosmesis in a sub-set of 118 patients participating in the TARGIT Trial from one centre (Perth, Australia). Methods Frontal digital photographs from 118 patients (60 IORT, 58 EBRT) taken one year after completion of breast conserving surgery were assessed blinded to allocated treatment arm using specialist software (BCCT.core 2.0, INESC Porto, Portugal) which produces a composite score (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor) based on asymmetry, colour and scar. This study had a power of 80% to detect a difference in proportion of outcome from 85% to 60% at p = 0.05 with 56 patients per group. Results Median age at randomisation was 61 (IQR 56-67) years; photographs were taken median 11 months after surgery; all patients were free from recurrence. The categories Excellent and Good; Fair and Poor; were combined. Results are shown in Table 1.

METHODS: An optical scanner was developed that interrogated the cut surface of bivalved, but otherwise unprocessed, sentinel lymph nodes with pulses of white light by elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS). The scattered light underwent spectral analysis, and individual spectra were initially correlated with conventional histology to develop a diagnostic algorithm. This algorithm was used to create false colour-coded maps of scans from an independent set of nodes, and the optimal criteria for discriminating between normal and cancer spectra were defined statistically. RESULTS: The discriminant algorithm was developed from a training set of 2989 spectra obtained from 30 metastatic and 331 normal nodes. Subsequent scans from 129 independent nodes were analysed. The scanner detected macrometastases (larger than 2 mm) with a sensitivity of 76 per cent (69 per cent including micrometastases) and specificity of 96 per cent. CONCLUSION: In this proof-of-principle study, the ESS results were comparable with current intraoperative diagnostic techniques of lymph node assessment.",eng,0

The concept has been validated, the techniques have been optimized, and randomized controlled trials have confirmed lower morbidity without compromising regional control compared with conventional treatment. The procedure is considered by many as the standard of care for staging the axilla in early breast cancer, although several unanswered questions remain. Adequate training and experience in the technique are vital to ensure high sentinel node identification and low false negative rates. Intraoperative radiotherapy is an attractive concept that enables delivery of single fraction radiotherapy in the operating room immediately after resection of the primary tumor. It is convenient for patients and appears effective in pilot studies. Partial breast irradiation to the index quadrant has been practiced for many years in the form o brachytherapy.

In some circumstances this procedure is not possible or is contraindicated or difficult. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) when EBRT is not feasible. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We report our experience with TARGIT in three centers (Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom) between 1999 and 2008. Patients at these centers received a single radiation dose of 20 Gy to the breast tissue in contact with the applicator (or 6 Gy at 1-cm distance), as they could not be given EBRT and were keen to avoid mastectomy. RESULTS: Eighty patients were treated with TARGIT. Reasons for using TARGIT were 21 patients had previously received EBRT, and 31 patients had clinical reasons such as systemic lupus erythematosus, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, morbid obesity, and cardiovascular or severe respiratory disease. Three of these patients received percutaneous radiotherapy without surgery; 28 patients were included for compelling personal reasons, usually on compassionate grounds. After a median follow-up of 38 months, only two local recurrences were observed, an annual local recurrence rate of 0.75% (95% confidence interval, 0.09%-2.70%). CONCLUSIONS: While we await the results of the randomized trial (over 2,000 patients have already been recruited), TARGIT is an acceptable option but only in highly selected cases that cannot be recruited in the trial and in whom EBRT is not feasible/possible.",eng,1

Three of these patients received percutaneous radiotherapy without surgery; 28 patients were included for compelling personal reasons, usually on compassionate grounds. After a median follow-up of 38 months, only two local recurrences were observed, an annual local recurrence rate of 0.75% (95% confidence interval, 0.09%-2.70%). Conclusions: While we await the results of the randomized trial (over 2,000 patients have already been recruited), TARGIT is an acceptable option but only in highly selected cases that cannot be recruited in the trial and in whom EBRT is not feasible/possible. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,0

Increasingly patients and physicians together are making the decision to use altered fractionation rather than standard 6-7 weeks of conventional whole breast treatment plus lumpectomy bed boost. Adjuvant hypofractionated whole breast irradiation is now viewed as a preferred strategy for many eligible women, and can be completed in 3-4 weeks. Adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation is another alternative that is typically delivered in 8-10 fractions over 4-5 days. With improvements in delivery techniques, there has been renewed interest in shortening treatment times even further, with novel intraoperative approaches and ultrashort courses of external beam RT. This article provides a summary of the status and future directions in intraoperative and ultrashort course RT schedules used in the treatment of breast cancer. Outlined are the benefits as well as the drawbacks of these techniques for abbreviated breast RT. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,0

This report presents 6-year data on treatment-related toxicities from the trial. METHODS: A total of 1449 primary early-stage breast cancers were treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using the MammoSite device (34 Gy in 10 fractions) in 1440 women. Of these, 1255 case (87%) had invasive breast cancer (IBC) (median size = 10 mm) and 194 cases (13%) had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (median size = 8 mm). Median follow-up was 59 months. Fisher exact test was performed to correlate categorical covariates with toxicity. RESULTS: Breast seromas were reported in 28% of cases (35.5% with open cavity and 21.7% with closed cavity placement). Also, 13% of all treated breasts developed symptomatic seromas, and 77% of these seromas developed during the 1st year after treatment. There were 172 cases (11.9%) that required drainage to correct. Use of chemotherapy and balloon fill >50 cc were associated with the development of symptomatic seromas. Also, 2.3% of patients developed fat necrosis (FN). The incidence of FN during years 1 and 2 were 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. Seroma formation, use of hormonal therapy, breast infection, and A/B cup size were associated with fat necrosis. There were 138 infections (9.5%) recorded; 98% occurred during the 1st year after treatment. Chemotherapy and seroma formation were associated with the development of infections. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-related toxicities 6 years after treatment with APBI using the MammoSite device are similar to those reported with other forms of APBI with similar follow-up.",eng,0

A further progression of the APBI literature has been the recent interest in extremely short courses of adjuvant radiotherapy, usually delivered by intraoperative radiotherapy techniques. This newer area of single-fraction radiotherapy approaches remains highly contentious. In particular, the recently reported TARGIT trial has been the subject of both praise and scorn, and a critical examination of the trial data and the underlying hypotheses is warranted. Short-term outcomes of the related Italian ELIOT approach have also been reported. Although the assumptions of linear quadratic formalism are likely to hold true in the range of 2 to 8 grays, equating different schedules beyond this range is problematic. A major problem of current single-fraction approaches is that the treatment doses are chosen empirically, or are based on tolerability, or on the physical dose delivery characteristics of the chosen technology rather than radiobiological rationale. This review article summarizes the current data on ultrashort courses of adjuvant breast radiotherapy and highlights both the promise and the potential pitfalls of the abbreviated treatment.",eng,0

Treatment of these patients requires attention to several important details. Importantly, these patients often have multiple comorbidities, a different risk-benefit profile, unique social barriers to care, higher chances for treatment toxicity, and higher risks of receiving less than standard-of-care treatment. Several tools now exist to stratify risk of morbidity in elderly patients receiving cancer therapies. Modern surgical therapy carries low risks for elderly women, and breast-conserving therapy should be offered to appropriate women. Standard regimens and schedules of systemic therapy should not be withheld in elderly patients on the basis of age alone. Several developments in radiation therapy, including the acceptance of hypofractionation and accelerated partial breast irradiation in selected women with low-risk disease, offer improved convenience and access to care. Radiation therapy may be omitted in elderly women with small hormone-sensitive tumors; however, omission may be most appropriate in women aged >80 years, those with comorbidities, and those likely to be compliant with hormonal therapy. © 2012.",,0

We present results of a dosimetric comparison of single catheter, balloon-based brachytherapy using the MammoSite catheter (BRT), 3D conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifteen patients were treated using the BRT device. With the use of CT scans with balloons in inflated and deflated states, plans were developed for each patient using each of the methods of PBI, for a total of 45 plans. The plans were then compared using the below dosimetric parameters. RESULTS: The mean V100 was 95%, 92%, and 94% for the BRT, 3DCRT, and IMRT techniques, respectively. The mean ipsilateral breast V50 was 29%, 56%, and 46% (p < 0.0001) and the mean ipsilateral lung V30 was 5%, 7%, and 2% (p < 0.001 for IMRT vs. others) for the BRT, 3DCRT, and IMRT methods, respectively. For the 10 patients with left-sided breast tumors, the mean heart V5 was 12%, 4%, and 1% for the BRT, 3DCRT, and IMRT methods, respectively (p < 0.01).

We designed a prospective trial to identify and address the potential radiobiological and logistical limitations of single-fraction, intraoperative APBI. Methods: We designed a single-arm, multi-institutional, prospective phase II trial that sequentially treats three cohorts of women (each n=30) with three progressively hypofractionated schedules. Eligible women were age > 50 years with unifocal invasive or in situ tumors < 3.0 cm, excised with negative margins, and with negative lymph nodes and positive hormone-receptors. Using a reference schedule of 60 Gy delivered in 2 Gy fractions, and assuming tumor parameters: a/b = 4 Gy; a = 0.27 Gy-1, and repopulation parameters of: Teff = 26 days; delay time = 0 days, the reference tumor BED is ~ 86 Gy4. We began with a schedule of 4 fractions of 7 Gy delivered twice-daily using a Contura MLB multi-lumen device. We defined very conservative dosimetric criteria for acceptability: maximum skin and rib dose to not exceed 100% of prescription dose, and V150 and V200 to not exceed 40 cc and 10 cc, respectively. Subsequent schedules are 3 fractions of 8.25 Gy and 2 fractions of 10.25 Gy, both delivered over 2 days. The primary endpoint is to exclude a local failure rate exceeding 10% with the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval. Results: A total of 30 patients have been enrolled at the 7 Gy x 4 fractions dose-level and followed for a minimum of 6 months. The median skin dose as a percent of prescription dose (PD) was 84% (40-100) and the median rib dose was 71% (16-119). 96% of the PTV-eval received a median of 95% of PD (range 85-103). The V150 (range 14-48cc) and V200 (range 0-29cc) criteria were met in all cases. One breast infection occurred and was treated; 2 cases of symptomatic fat necrosis and 2 cases of symptomatic seromas occurred. No acute toxicities greater than CTCAE grade 2 have been observed. Conclusion: Short-course APBI is dosimetrically feasible using the Contura MLB and appears to be tolerable in terms of acute toxicities. Our approach is based on well-defined radiobiological parameters and allows for an abbreviated course of treatment that is guided by full pathological review and the ability to objectively achieve and validate acceptable dosimetric criteria in each case.

However, many of these patients will require a subsequent salvage mastectomy and reconstruction after a locoregional recurrence. This study examines whether prior BCT leads to higher rates of complications and dissatisfaction with subsequent mastectomy and breast reconstruction. METHODS: All women undergoing initial breast reconstruction at an academic institution were identified (1999-2006). Women who had undergone prior BCT were compared with women without prior BCT. A questionnaire adapted from the Michigan Breast Reconstruction Outcomes Survey was administered. Rates of complications, as well as general and aesthetic satisfaction, were compared between the 2 groups. Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the effects of prior BCT, age, comorbidities, reconstruction type, and time between radiation and reconstruction. RESULTS: Overall, 532 women underwent 802 reconstructions, of whom 113 women (137 reconstructions) had prior BCT. Prior BCT did not correlate with higher complication rates (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09, P = 0.690), or lower general or aesthetic satisfaction (OR = 0.84, P = 0.559; OR = 0.91, P = 0.723, respectively); however, there was an increased rate of mastectomy skin flap loss (12.4% vs. 6.8%, P = 0.024). Increasing age was the most significant risk factor for complications and dissatisfaction. CONCLUSION: Radiation in the setting of BCT did not increase overall rates of complications or dissatisfaction with subsequent breast reconstruction in our patient population. These patients, however, had a higher incidence of mastectomy skin flap loss. These findings are important for preoperative counseling and intraoperative planning in patients with prior lumpectomy and radiation.",eng,0

Major mastectomy skin flap necrosis is a significant complication with outcomes ranging from poor aesthetic appearance to reconstructive failure. The present study aimed to explore the interactions between intraoperative fill and other risk factors on the incidence of flap necrosis in patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate expander/implant-based reconstruction. METHODS: A retrospective review of 966 consecutive patients (1,409 breasts) who underwent skin or nipple sparing mastectomy with immediate tissue expander reconstruction at a single institution was conducted. Age, body mass index, hypertension, smoking status, premastectomy and postmastectomy radiation, acellular dermal matrix use, and application of the tumescent mastectomy technique were analyzed as potential predictors of flap necrosis both independently and as synergistic variables with high intraoperative fill. The following three measures of interaction were calculated: relative excess risk due to interaction, attributable proportion of risk due to interaction, and synergy index (SI). RESULTS: Intraoperative tissue expander fill volume was high (>/=66.7% of the maximum volume) in 40.9% (576 of 1,409 breasts) of cases. The unadjusted flap necrosis rate was greater in the high intraoperative fill cohort than in the low fill cohort (10.4% vs. 7.1%, p=0.027). Multivariate logistic regression did not identify high intraoperative fill volume as an independent risk factor for flap necrosis (odds ratio 1.442, 95% confidence interval 0.973-2.137, p=0.068). However, four risk factors were identified that interacted significantly with intraoperative fill volume, namely tumescence, age, hypertension, and obesity. The SI, or the departure from additive risks, was largest for tumescence (SI, 25.3), followed by hypertension (SI, 2.39), obesity (SI, 2.28), and age older than 50 years (SI, 1.17). CONCLUSION: In the postmastectomy, hypovascular milieu, multiple risk factors decreasing flap perfusion interact with high intraoperative fill volume to cross a threshold and synergistically increase the risk of flap necrosis.",eng,0

Following IRB approval, we have offered women a second attempt at breast conservation for those motivated to avoid mastectomy. This study explores the efficacy and toxicity of partial breast re-irradiation in recurrent, ipsilateral breast cancers occurring five or more years after initial radiotherapeutic intervention. Materials/Methods: Between October 2008 and December 2011, seven women with in-breast recurrent cancers were treated with either intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) using a single dose of 21 Gy or brachytherapy (MB) using a dose of 34 Gy in 10 fractions delivered twice daily over 5 days. Eligibility criteria included (1) a disease free interval of at least five years from time of initial radiation therapy, (2) tumor size > 3 cm, and (3) negative nodes. Eligible patients were required to have undergone resection of recurrent disease with negative margins of < 2mm prior to re-irradiation. Treatment modality (IORT vs. MB) was left to the discretion of the patient after detailed discussion of the risks, benefits, and rationale of both options. Six patients elected IORT and one elected MB. Results: Patient's median age at the time of recurrence was 65 years (range, 39-81) and the median size of the recurrent lesion was 1.3 cm (range, 0.7-1.8). All patients had ER/PR positive tumors; and one had evidence of Her-2/neu amplification. All patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy and 2 patients received chemotherapy prior to hormonal therapy. The median follow-up was 1.2 years. One 80-year-old patient with a 1.8 cm grade 3 lesion, experienced a second in-breast recurrence at 2.9 years following her re-irradiation. This second recurrence was within the tumor bed and successfully treated with mastectomy. No patient developed metastatic disease. Four patients (57%) developed seromas, one requiring surgery due to discomfort. One patient (MB) developed telangiectasia. No patients experienced pneumonitis, rib fractures, infections, or wound dehiscence. Cosmesis was rated as acceptable"" both by the patient and physician evaluation. Conclusions: In well-selected patients, partial breast re-irradiation is feasible with an acceptable toxicity profile, cosmetic outcome, and recurrence risk.

In this study, we report on the relationship between heterogeneity-corrected and -uncorrected doses for 2 commonly used plan evaluation metrics: maximum point dose to skin surface and maximum point dose to ribs. Maximum point doses to skin surface and ribs were calculated using TG-43 and Varian Acuros for 20 patients treated with breast balloon brachytherapy. The results were plotted against each other and fit with a zero-intercept line. Max skin dose (Acuros) = max skin dose (TG-43) * 0.930 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.995). The average magnitude of difference from this relationship was 1.1% (max 2.8%). Max rib dose (Acuros) = max rib dose (TG-43) * 0.955 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9995). The average magnitude of difference from this relationship was 0.7% (max 1.6%). Heterogeneity-corrected maximum point doses to the skin surface and ribs were proportional to TG-43-calculated doses. The average deviation from proportionality was 1%. The proportional relationship suggests that a different metric other than maximum point dose may be needed to obtain a clinical advantage from heterogeneity correction. Alternatively, if maximum point dose continues to be used in recommended limits while incorporating heterogeneity correction, institutions without this capability may be able to accurately estimate these doses by use of a scaling factor. © 2013 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists.",,0

A Deformable Registration Study,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&AN=70277568","Purpose/Objective(s): Different expansion margins are typically used to define the clinical target volume (CTV) in accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered via balloon brachytherapy (1 cm) vs. three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) (1.5 cm). Previous studies have argued using geometric reasoning that these margins should be equivalent. In this study, deformable registration is used to generate directly comparable treatment volumes on CT sets with and without a brachytherapy balloon. Materials/Methods: Ten patients previously treated with MammoSite were studied. Each patient had two CT scans, one with and one without the balloon. In-house deformable registration software was used to deform the brachytherapy target volume onto the balloonless CT set. Results of the deformation were verified using anatomical landmarks common to both image sets. The deformed brachytherapy target volume was compared to volumes based on uniform lumpectomy cavity expansions of 1 and 1.5 cm. Non-uniform cavity expansions in 6 directions (left, right, anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, 60 expansions total) were also chosen to match the deformed brachytherapy target's dimensions and volume. Results: Of the sixty direction-specific cavity expansions used to match the deformed brachytherapy target, only 22 exceeded 1 cm, and none exceeded 1.5 cm. Only small portions of the deformed targets could be found to lie 1.5-2 cm from the cavity. Fourteen of 60 expansions were smaller than 1 cm. These decreases in effective treatment margin were attributed to poor cavity-to-balloon conformance. In terms of volume, the deformed brachytherapy targets were on average 8 +/- 9% larger and 37 +/- 4% smaller than 3DCRT targets based on uniform expansions of 1 and 1.5 cm respectively. Conclusions: Deformable registration suggests that although balloon brachytherapy typically does treat an effective margin greater than 1 cm, its treatment volumes are significantly smaller, from both a margin and volume standpoint, than CTVs based on a 1.5 cm margin, which are often used in interstitial brachytherapy and 3D-CRT. If long-term patient follow-up shows a difference in tumor recurrence rates between APBI modalities, this could be an explanation. Alternatively, if there is no difference in recurrence, then this result may support margin reduction for 3D-CRT to reduce toxicity risks.",,0

Radiographic contrast is normally injected into breast brachytherapy balloons. In this study, the authors independently estimate properties of contrast solution that were expected to be incorrectly specified in a commercial brachytherapy dose calculation algorithm. Methods: The mass density and atomic weight fractions of a clinical formulation of radiographic contrast solution were determined using manufacturers' data. The mass density was verified through measurement and compared with the density obtained by the treatment planning system's CT calibration. The atomic weight fractions were used to determine the photon interaction cross section of the contrast solution for a commercial high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy source and compared with that of muscle. Results: The density of contrast solution was 10% less than that obtained from the CT calibration. The cross section of the contrast solution for the HDR source was 1.2% greater than that of muscle. Both errors could be addressed by overriding the density of the contrast solution in the treatment planning system. Conclusions: The authors estimate the error in mass density and cross section parameters used by a commercial brachytherapy dose calculation algorithm for radiographic contrast used in a clinical breast brachytherapy practice. This approach is adaptable to other clinics seeking to evaluate dose calculation errors and determine appropriate density override values if desired. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",,0

CT number-tomass density conversion will probably overestimate the mass density inside the balloon because of the high-Z element in the contrast. In addition, AcurosTM may use an incorrect photon cross section due to incorrect material assignment of the balloon's contents. In this study, we evaluate the magnitude of these errors in our clinical practice. Materials and Methods: The mass density and atomic weight fraction of our department's formulation of balloon contrast solution: 2 cc of ConrayTM (Covidien) and 100 cc of 0.9% saline solution (Hospira), were determined using manufacturers' data. The calculated mass density was compared with those obtained from our treatment planning system's CT number-to-mass density conversion. The calculated atomic weight fraction was used to determine the photon cross section of the contrast solution versus skeletal muscle using the NIST XCOM photon cross sections database and energy spectrum data for a VariSource VS2000 from the CLRP TG-43 parameter database. Selected point doses were compared using AcurosTM BV v10 in seven patients before and after overriding the density of the contrast solution to reflect the combined effect of the density and cross section difference. Results: The density of the contrast solution was calculated to be 1.011 g/ cc. This is 10% less than the mean 1.11 g/cc obtained from the planning system's CT number-to-mass density conversion. The cross section for the contrast solution was calculated to be 0.1084 cm2/g which was 1.2% greater than the cross-section obtained for muscle, which was 0.1071 cm2/g. In seven patients, these errors resulted in a mean dose difference of about 0.6% (range: 0.1-1.0%) at the maximum skin dose point. The effect of the cross section difference on dose was ~0.1% and acts in the opposite direction of the density error. We observed that overriding the density of the entire balloon (including trapped air) instead of just the contrast solution could lead to implausible results (i.e., lower calculated dose after override.) Conclusions: We estimate the error in mass density and cross section parameters used by AcurosTM in the presence of radiographic contrast in breast brachytherapy balloons in our clinical practice. Our method is adaptable to other clinics' contrast solution formulations in order to evaluate dose calculation errors and determine appropriate density override values if desired.

The cases of 172 patients who underwent BCS between June 1989 and March 2001 were studied. The pathologic features and positive margins were evaluated by microscopic examination of frozen and preserved sections. The grade of each positive margin was arbitrarily classified into one of four groups: i) cancer involved; ii) closed margin (<2 mm); iii) partially closed margin (>3 mm and <5 mm) and iv) free margin (>5 mm). Biomarkers were estimated by immunohistochemistry and DNA ploidy, and the relationship of clinical parameters was statistically analyzed using the chi(2) test. In 59 of 172 cases (34.3%), the surgical margin was positive: horizontal in 47 cases (27.3%) and vertical in 12 cases (6.9%). The free margin was significantly correlated with positive status of estrogen and progesterone receptors and middle age (35-50 years) in the patients, while clinicopathologic factors were not correlated with positive margins in surgical specimens. Although 17 cases of cancer were found in 9 frozen specimens and 8 preserved sections, the mammographic findings showed spiculated masses in 7 of the 9 frozen specimens (77.7%) and 4 of the 8 preserved sections (50%), and microcalcification in 2 frozen specimens (22.2%) and 4 preserved sections (50%). The overexpression (2+ or 3+) of the HER-2 protein was found in 8 of the 9 frozen specimens (87.5%) and in 7 of the 8 preserved sections (88.8%). In the 11 cases with spiculated masses, extensive intraductal components (EICs) of various grades were found; the presence of EICs in a spiculated lesion was observed in 5 of the 7 frozen specimens and in all 4 of the preserved sections. The local extension of breast carcinoma cells in BCS is associated in part with the findings of spiculation and microcalcification, which are associated with EICs. The overexpression of HER-2 protein appears to play a role in EICs in positive margins, and needs to be considered for avoiding positive margins in BCS on patients with breast carcinoma.",eng,0
Journal Article,Y. Kim,2015.0,Dosimetric impact of source-positioning uncertainty in high-dose-rate balloon brachytherapy of breast cancer,10.5114/jcb.2015.55293,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the dosimetric impact of source-positioning uncertainty in high-dose-rate (HDR) balloon brachytherapy of breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For 49 HDR balloon patients, each dwell position of catheter(s) was manually shifted distally (+) and proximally (-) with a magnitude from 1 to 4 mm. Total 392 plans were retrospectively generated and compared to corresponding clinical plans using 7 dosimetric parameters: dose (D95) to 95% of planning target volume for evaluation (PTV_EVAL), and volume covered by 100% and 90% of the prescribed dose (PD) (V100 and V90); skin and rib maximum point dose (Dmax); normal breast tissue volume receiving 150% and 200% of PD (V150 and V200). RESULTS: PTV_EVAL dosimetry deteriorated with larger average/maximum reduction (from +/- 1 mm to +/- 4 mm) for larger source position uncertainty (p value < 0.0001): from 1.0%/2.5%, 3.3%/5.9%, 6.3%/10.0% to 9.8%/14.5% for D95; from 1.0%/2.6%, 3.1%/5.7%, 5.8%/8.9% to 8.7%/12.3% for V100; from 0.2%/1.5%, 1.0%/4.0%, 2.7%/6.8% to 5.1%/10.3% for V90. >/= +/- 3 mm shift reduced average D95 to < 95% and average V100 to < 90%. While skin and rib Dmax change was case-specific, its absolute change (mid R:Delta(Value)mid R:) showed that larger shift and high dose group had larger variation compared to smaller and lower dose group (p value < 0.0001), respectively. Normal breast tissue V150 variation was case-specific and small. Average mid R:Delta(V150)mid R: was 0.2 cc for the largest shift (+/- 4 mm) with maximum < 1.7 cc. V200 was increased with higher elevation for larger shift: from 6.4 cc/9.8 cc, 7.0 cc/10.1 cc, 8.0 cc/11.3 cc to 9.2 cc/ 13.0 cc. CONCLUSIONS: The tolerance of +/- 2 mm recommended by AAPM TG 56 is clinically acceptable in most clinical cases. However, special attention should be paid to a case where both skin and rib are located proximally to balloon, and the orientation of balloon catheter(s) is vertical to these critical structures. In this case, sufficient dosimetric planning margins are required.",eng,0

HDR balloon brachytherapy has become more popular in partial breast irradiation; yet to our knowledge, there is no report on the pacemaker dose in HDR balloon brachytherapy. The aim of this study is to report the pacemaker dose and provide pretreatment recommendations in HDR balloon brachytherapy. Materials and Methods: A three dimensional volume of pacemaker was retrospectively generated by delineating the pacemaker on planning computed tomography (CT) images for 3 patients (pts): 1 MammoSite- (pt A) and 2 Contura HDR patients (pts B and C). Dosimetric data such as minimal, mean and maximal doses were extracted from dose-volume histogram in treatment plans and compared with the dose limit imposed by manufacturers (10 Gy for pt A; 2 Gy for pts B and C). To make a guideline for the pacemaker dose in HDR balloon brachytherapy, a simulation was performed using the inverse square relationship between the maximal pacemaker dose and the minimal distance of pacemaker from the balloon surface (mDPB). It was assumed that the shape of balloon was a perfect sphere and the prescribed dose (34 Gy) point was located on the surface of 1 cm expansion from balloon surface. Results: All pacemakers were implanted in the subclavicular region. The balloon volume (diameter) was 49.3 cc (4.5 cm) for pt A, 51.2 cc (4.6 cm) for pt B and 59.8 cc (4.9 cm) for pt C. The minimal, mean and maximal doses were 0.6 Gy, 1 Gy and 1.6 Gy for pt A; 0.3 Gy, 0.4 Gy and 0.5 Gy for pt B; 1.6 Gy, 4.2 Gy and 9.1 Gy for pt C. The manufacture dose limit to the pacemaker was satisfied in pts A and B while it was violated in pt C. No clinical malfunction of this pacemaker during and after treatment was noticed. The mDPB was 12.8 cm for pt A, 23.0 cm for pt B and 4.3 cm for pt C, respectively. (Figure presented) Figure shows the maximal pacemaker dose for various sizes of balloon volume ranging from 30 cc to 130 cc (corresponding range of balloon diameter is from 3.9 cm to 6.3 cm) as well as for the distance from the balloon surface. Note that the dose at 1 cm from the balloon surface is always 34 Gy for all size of balloon. Clinically, the balloon volume cannot be determined until the balloon is implanted. However, it is feasible to measure the minimal distance between the lumpectomy cavity and the pacemaker on the CT scan prior to balloon implantation. In addition, balloon volume can be estimated on ultrasound images following lumpectomy. Conclusions: The dosimetric analysis on the pacemaker reveals that assessing and reporting the pacemaker dose is of clinical importance in HDR balloon brachytherapy. The proposed method can estimate the maximal pacemaker dose prior to balloon implantation to determine patient suitability for HDR brachytherapy. HDR balloon brachytherapy can be safely performed for lesions of the breast at safe clinical distance from the pacemaker by satisfying manufacturer's dose limits.",,0

Trombetta,2012.0,Pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator dose in balloon high-dose-rate brachytherapy for breast cancer treatment,10.1016/j.brachy.2012.01.001,"PURPOSE: To retrospectively report pacemaker (PM)/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) dose in balloon high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy and provide distance-dose graph and table to approximately estimate the maximal device dose. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 3 patients (A, B, and C), PM/ICD was retrospectively contoured on planning computed tomography images and its maximal dose was extracted from a dose-volume histogram. The surface of 1cm expansion from balloon was prescribed to 34Gy and the inverse square law was dominant factor in dose calculation. Therefore, the maximal PM/ICD dose was approximately estimated from the distance-dose graph or table and compared with that of the treatment plan. RESULTS: The minimal device-balloon surface distance was 10.9, 18.4, and 4.3cm for patient A, B, and C, respectively. The maximal dose estimated from the proposed table/graph was 2.1 vs. 1.61Gy for patient A, 0.87 vs. 0.49Gy for patient B, and 8.9 vs. 9.14Gy for patient C compared with that from the treatment plan. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the location of PM/ICD relative to the tumor bed, balloon HDR brachytherapy is feasible if the maximal dose is less than or equal to the dose limit. The proposed distance-dose graph and/or table enable to approximately predict the maximal device dose based on the measurement of minimal distance between lumpectomy and the device before balloon implantation for the suitability of balloon HDR brachytherapy.",eng,0

San Jose, CA) is placed on the surface of the breast to minimize radiation to other organs and reduce dose to personnel. Despite pressure from the external shielding, balloon shape and skin spacing are assumed constant and their variation is ignored. We performed a phantom study to evaluate deformation of the implanted balloon and changes in skin spacing due to the pressure of external shielding. Materials and Methods: A breast phantom was created by overlaying a silicone breast prosthesis (Jodee Inc., Hollywood, FL) over a Xoft eBx (iCAD Inc., San Jose, CA) spherical balloon applicator. The prosthesis was positioned to simulate a clinically difficult case in which skin spacing is marginally acceptable (8.6 - 10.2 mm) and the balloon touches the chest wall shield. To simulate the effect of chest wall shielding while avoiding metal image artifact, a 5cm diameter circular plastic plate was placed underneath the balloon. In order to overcome the significant metal streak artifact from the FlexiShield in kV CT scan, megavoltage CT (MVCT) scan was acquired using helical TomoTherapy HiART system (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Two sets of MVCT images were taken with/without the FlexiShield for three different sizes of spherical balloon applicator: small (3-4 cm), medium (4-5 cm) and large (5-6 cm). For each balloon, different manufacturer-suggested balloon-fill volumes were simulated: 3 cases for small, 4 cases for medium and 7 cases for large balloon. Total number of MVCT scans was 28 for 14 pairs. 50% contrast solution in volume was used to improve image contrast of balloon relative to the breast tissue phantom. Three dimensional (3D) MVCT images were aligned along the balloon shaft so that central slice of balloon perpendicular to the balloon shaft showed the maximum dimension of balloon on 2D images (Figure). Two chords of the balloon were measured in anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) directions. Skin spacing was measured in AP direction from skin surface to the balloon surface. Balloon deformation was defined as the eccentricity of balloon ellipse [%]: (linear eccentricity/major axis) x 100. The difference in measurements between MVCT scans with/without the FlexiShield was reported. Results: Based on measurement data from 14 pairs of MVCT scans, balloon eccentricity was consistently increased due to the FlexiShield and mean +/- standard deviation (maximum - minimum) value was 11.4 +/- 5.6% (4.0 - 20.8%). AP compression and LAT expansion was 1.4 +/- 0.6 mm (0.4 - 2.4 mm) and 0.93 +/- 0.5 mm (0.2 - 1.7 mm), respectively. Also, skin spacing was constantly reduced by 1.0 +/- 0.3 mm (0.4 - 1.7 mm). All measurements (AP, LAT, skin spacing) between with/without the FlexiShield were significantly different (p-value = 0.0001) when paired non-parametric test (Wilcoxon matched signed-ranks test) was performed. Conclusions: This phantom study reveals that external shielding is capable of reducing skin spacing and compressing the balloon in AP direction while expanding it in LAT direction. This can be translated into discrepancy of delivered dose from the treatment plan. Therefore, the impact of external shielding should be considered; particularly, in a case where balloon is implanted closely to both skin and chest wall. (Table Presented).",,0

Miften,2008.0,Investigation of interfraction variations of MammoSite balloon applicator in high-dose-rate brachytherapy of partial breast irradiation,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.01.024,"PURPOSE: To measure the interfraction changes of the MammoSite applicator and evaluate their dosimetric effect on target coverage and sparing of organs at risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective evaluation of the data from 19 patients who received 10 fractions (34 Gy) of high-dose-rate partial breast irradiation was performed. A computed tomography-based treatment plan was generated for Fraction 1, and a computed tomography scan was acquired just before the delivery of each fraction to ensure a consistent shape of the balloon. The eccentricity, asymmetry, and planning target volume (PTV) for plan evaluation purposes (PTV_EVAL), as well as trapped air gaps, were measured for all patients. Furthermore, 169 computed tomography-based treatment plans were retrospectively generated for Fractions 2-10. Interfraction dosimetric variations were evaluated using the %PTV_EVAL coverage, target dose homogeneity index, target dose conformal index, and maximum doses to the organs at risks. RESULTS: The average variation of eccentricity and asymmetry from Fraction 1 values of 3.5% and 1.1 mm was -0.4% +/- 1.6% and -0.1 +/- 0.6 mm. The average trapped air gap volume was dramatically reduced from before treatment (3.7 cm(3)) to Fraction 1 (0.8 cm(3)). The PTV_EVAL volume change was insignificant. The average variation for the %PTV_EVAL, target dose homogeneity, and target dose conformal index from Fraction 1 values of 94.7%, 0.64, and 0.85 was 0.15% +/- 2.4%, -0.35 +/- 2.4%, and -0.34 +/- 4.9%, respectively. The average Fraction 1 maximum skin and ipsilateral lung dose of 3.2 Gy and 2.0 Gy varied by 0.08 +/- 0.47 and -0.16 +/- 0.29 Gy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The interfraction variations were patient specific and fraction dependent. Although the average interfraction dose variations for the target and organs at risk were not clinically significant, the maximum variations could be clinically significant.",eng,0
Journal Article,Y. Kim; M. G. Trombetta,2011.0,Objective method to report planner-independent skin/rib maximal dose in balloon-based high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy for breast cancer,10.1118/1.3568927,"PURPOSE: An objective method was proposed and compared with a manual selection method to determine planner-independent skin and rib maximal dose in balloon-based high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy planning. METHODS: The maximal dose to skin and rib was objectively extracted from a dose volume histogram (DVH) of skin and rib volumes. A virtual skin volume was produced by expanding the skin surface in three dimensions (3D) external to the breast with a certain thickness in the planning computed tomography (CT) images. Therefore, the maximal dose to this volume occurs on the skin surface the same with a conventional manual selection method. The rib was also delineated in the planning CT images and its maximal dose was extracted from its DVH. The absolute (Abdiff = [D(max) Man - D (max)DVH]) and relative (Rediff[%] = 100 x ([D(max)Man-D(max)DVH])/D(max)DVH) maximal skin and rib dose differences between the manual selection method (D(max)Man) and the objective method (D(max)DVH) were measured for 50 balloon-based HDR (25 MammoSite and 25 Contura) patients. RESULTS: The average +/- standard deviation of maximal dose difference was 1.67% +/- 1.69% of the prescribed dose (PD). No statistical difference was observed between MammoSite and Contura patients for both Abdiff and Rediff[%] values. However, a statistically significant difference (p value < 0.0001) was observed in maximal rib dose difference compared with maximal skin dose difference for both Abdiff (2.30% +/- 1.71% vs 1.05% +/- 1.43%) and Rediff[%] (2.32% +/- 1.79% vs 1.21% +/- 1.41%). In general, rib has a more irregular contour and it is more proximally located to the balloon for 50 HDR patients. Due to the inverse square law factor, more dose difference was observed in higher dose range (D(max) > 90%) compared with lower dose range (D(max) < 90%): 2.16% +/- 1.93% vs 1.19% +/- 1.25% with p value of 0.0049. However, the Rediff[%] analysis eliminated the inverse square factor and there was no statistically significant difference (p value = 0.8931) between high and low dose ranges. CONCLUSIONS: The objective method using volumetric information of skin and rib can determine the planner-independent maximal dose compared with the manual selection method. However, the difference was < 2% of PD, on average, if appropriate attention is paid to selecting a manual dose point in 3D planning CT images.",eng,0

Trombetta,2014.0,Dosimetric evaluation of multilumen intracavitary balloon applicator rotation in high-dose-rate brachytherapy for breast cancer,10.1120/jacmp.v15i1.4429,"The objective of this work is to evaluate dosimetric impact of multilumen balloon applicator rotation in high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for breast cancer. Highly asymmetrical dose distribution was generated for patients A and B, depending upon applicator proximity to skin and rib. Both skin and rib spacing was </= 0.7 cm for A; only rib spacing was </= 0.7 cm for B. Thirty-five rotation scenarios were simulated for each patient by rotating outer lumens every 10 degrees over +/- 180 degrees range with respect to central lumen using mathematically calculated rotational matrix. Thirty-five rotated plans were compared with three plans: 1) original multidwell multilumen (MDML) plan, 2) multidwell single-lumen (MDSL) plan, and 3) single-dwell single-lumen (SDSL) plan. For plan comparison, planning target volume for evaluation (PTV_EVAL) coverage (dose to 95% and 90% volume of PTV_EVAL) (D95 and D90), skin and rib maximal dose (Dmax), and normal breast tissue volume receiving 150% (V150) and 200% (V200) of prescribed dose (PD) were evaluated. Dose variation due to device rotation ranged from -5.6% to 0.8% (A) and -6.5% to 0.2% (B) for PTV_EVAL D95; -5.2% to 0.4% (A) and -4.1% to 0.7% (B) for PTV_EVAL D90; -2.0 to 18.4% (A) and -7.8 to 17.5% (B) for skin Dmax; -11.1 to 22.8% (A) and -4.7 to 55.1% (B) of PD for rib Dmax, respectively. Normal breast tissue V150 and V200 variation was &lt; 1.0 cc, except for -0.1 to 2.5cc (B) of V200. Furthermore, 30 degrees device rotation increased rib Dmax over 145% of PD: 152.9% (A) by clockwise 30 degrees rotation and 152.5% (B) by counterclockwise 30 degrees rotation. For a highly asymmetric dose distribution, device rotation can outweigh the potential benefit of improved dose shaping capability afforded by multilumen and make dosimetric data worse than single-lumen plans unless it is properly corrected.",eng,0
Journal Article,Y. Kim; M. G. Trombetta; M. Miften,2010.0,Comparison of single and multiple dwell position methods in MammoSite high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy planning,", ","The purpose of this study is to dosimetrically compare two plans generated using single dwell position method (SDPM) and multiple dwell position methods (MDPM) in MammoSite high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy planning for 19 breast cancer patients. In computed tomography (CT) image-based HDR planning, a surface optimization technique was used in both methods. Following dosimetric parameters were compared for fraction 1 plans: %PTV_EVAL (planning target volume for plan evaluation) coverage, dose homogeneity index (DHI), dose con-formal index (COIN), maximum dose to skin and ipsilateral lung, and breast tissue volume receiving 150% (V150[cc]) and 200% (V200[cc]) of the prescribed dose. In addition, a plan was retrospectively generated for each fraction 2-10 to simulate the clinical situation where the fraction 1 plan was used for fractions 2-10 without modification. In order to create nine derived plans for each method and for each of the 19 patients, the catheter location and contours of target and critical structures were defined on the CT images acquired prior to each fraction 2-10, while using the same dwell-time distribution as used for fraction 1 (original plan). Interfraction dose variations were evaluated for 19 patients by comparing the derived nine plans (each for fractions 2-10) with the original plan (fraction 1) using the same dosimetric parameters used for fraction 1 plan comparison. For the fraction 1 plan comparison, the MDPM resulted in slightly increased %PTV_EVAL coverage, COIN, V150[cc] and V200[cc] values by an average of 1.2%, 0.025, 0.5 cc and 0.7cc, respectively, while slightly decreased DHI, maximum skin and ipsilateral lung dose by an average of 0.003, 3.2 cGy and 5.8 cGy, respectively. For the inter-fraction dose variation comparison, the SDPM resulted in slightly smaller variations in %PTV_EVAL coverage, DHI, maximum skin dose and V150[cc] values by an average of 0.4%, 0.0005, 0.5 cGy and 0.2 cc, respectively, while slightly higher average variations in COIN, maximum ipsilateral lung dose and V200[cc] values by 0.0028, 0.2 cGy and 0.2 cc, respectively. All differences were too small to be clinically significant. Compared to the MDPM, the SDPM combined with a surface optimization technique can generate a clinically comparable fraction 1 treatment plan with a similar interfraction dose variation if a single source is carefully positioned at the center of the balloon catheter.",eng,0

Journal Article,G. Kindermann,1991.0,[Differentiated operative therapy of endometrial carcinomas],", ","The traditional surgical procedure to treat operable endometrial cancer is the removal of the uterus and both adnexa. In the trend of modern gynecological oncology this standardized operation should be changed in favour to a more individual procedure adapted to preoperative and intraoperative stage of the disease. A carefully fractioned curettage (of the cervix and the corpus uteri) is necessary to differ stage I (T1) and stage II (T2). Further important prognostic factors as myometrial invasion, nodal status, lymph vessel and blood vessel involvement and the intraabdominal findings (T3) are details of the post-surgical evaluation. A differentiated surgical treatment of the endometrial cancer includes for a stage I disease hysterectomy, bilateral adnectomy and pelvine lymphonodectomy. We recommend this additional procedure in all stages of the disease: The nodal status is for almost all genital cancers and breast cancer the most important prognostic factor. Postoperative adjuvent therapy (radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy) may be indicated by that. The surgical procedure for stage II (corpus and cervix involved) disease is a radical hysterectomy (Wertheim), bilateral adnectomy and pelvine lymphonodectomy. A paraaortal lymphonodectomy may be recommended, but most of the patients are 70 years and more and have a multimorbidity. Therefore, we indicated this additional procedure only in 7.5% of the operated patients. The surgical strategy in the (rare) stage III individual cancer is similar to the procedure in progressive ovarian cancer: Cytoreduction and debulking (e.g. omentum majus, peritoneum, involved bowel) has to be performed subsequent to hysterectomy, bilateral adnectomy and lymphonodectomy to improve the poor prognosis.",ger,0

In some developing countries, EBRT (including the cost of relocating to a major centre) is unaffordable leaving mastectomy as the sole surgical treatment option. We evaluated the feasibility of introducing IORT for operable breast cancer, into a developing country. Method: Data from published reports was collected on the incidence of breast cancer in Tanzania. A literature review was conducted on the treatment and resource options available. An on-site visit to a breast cancer unit in Tanzania was undertaken to determine the typical pathway for treating newly diagnosed breast cancer. The cost of mastectomy, breast conserving surgery with EBRT or with IORT were estimated and compared. Results: Electricity was a limiting factor for many centres and electricity sharing is the norm within Tanzania. Lack of electricity is an important limiting factor for the availability of radiotherapy. The cost of patients undergoing surgery with IORT amounts to significantly less than surgery followed by EBRT, most significantly the setup costs. Conclusion: IORT would be viable and beneficial financially and clinically in Tanzania for breast conserving surgery. It would however be necessary to implement basic infrastructure such as sustainable electricity before this is introduced.",,0

Deshpande,2005.0,HDR brachytherapy combined with 3-D conformal vs. IMRT in left-sided breast cancer patients including internal mammary chain: comparative analysis of dosimetric and technical parameters,", ","Treatment of the internal mammary chain (IMC) with radiation therapy (RT) for patients with breast cancer remains a controversial issue. Different treatment techniques have been proposed, including oblique electrons, electron-photon combination, and partially wide tangents (PWTs). However, the residual heart dose can remain significant mainly for left-sided lesions. With PWTs and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), respiratory movement and errors in IMC localization remain a problem. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of IMC brachytherapy (IMCBT) combined with 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) planning on heart, lung, and contralateral breast doses compared with IMRT. All plans including IMCBT plus 3DCRT were done on PLATO; IMRT plans were generated using the Cadplan-Helios inverse treatment-planning software module with the sliding window"" technique. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were calculated for all volumes of interest. Conformity and homogeneity index was also calculated for the planning target volume (PTV). Dose distribution in the surrounding normal tissue was evaluated. The mean conformity of the PTV was found to be 1.06 with IMCBT plus 3DCRT and 1.12 with IMRT. The mean homogeneity (HI95/107) was found to be 1.4 with IMCBT plus 3DCRT and 3.32 with IMRT. Using the IMCBT plus 3DCRT technique, the mean dose to the heart, contralateral breast, ipsilateral lung, and contralateral lung decreased with values of 32%, 6.76%, 20% and 5.52%, respectively, compared with IMRT. This novel technique of IMCBT plus 3DCRT can potentially reduce the dose to the heart and lungs. In addition, it rivals IMRT because of its unique advantages in localization, obviating the need for respiratory gating and maximum sparing of heart and other structures.""",eng,0

We have now extended the same study to the clinical application of this MOSFET as an in-vivo dosimetry system. The MOSFET was used during high dose rate brachytherapy (HDRBT) of internal mammary chain (IMC) irradiation for a carcinoma of the breast. The aim of this study was to measure the skin dose during IMC irradiation with a MOSFET and a TLD and compare it with the calculated dose with a treatment planning system (TPS). The skin dose was measured for ten patients. All the patients' treatment was planned on a PLATO treatment planning system. TLD measurements were performed to compare the accuracy of the measured results from the MOSFET. The mean doses measured with the MOSFET and the TLD were identical (0.5392 Gy, 15.85% of the prescribed dose). The mean dose was overestimated by the TPS and was 0.5923 Gy (17.42% of the prescribed dose). The TPS overestimated the skin dose by 9% as verified by the MOSFET and TLD. The MOSFET provides adequate in-vivo dosimetry for HDRBT. Immediate readout after irradiation, small size, permanent storage of dose and ease of use make the MOSFET a viable alternative for TLDs.",eng,0

Specifically, the dose perturbation is quantified as a heterogeneity correction factor (HCF) for various balloon radii and contrast concentration levels. The dose perturbation is larger for larger balloon radii and higher contrast concentrations. Based on a validated Monte Carlo simulation, the calculated HCF values are 0.99 for a 2 cm radius balloon and 0.98 for a 3 cm radius balloon at 6% contrast concentration levels, and 0.89 and 0.87 for 2 and 3 cm radius balloons, respectively, at 100% contrast concentrations. For a typical implanted balloon radius of 2.4 cm, the HCF values decrease from 0.99 at 6% contrast concentration to 0.90 at 100% contrast concentration. For balloons implanted in patients at our institution, the mean HCF is 0.99, corresponding to a dose reduction of approximately 1%.

There are surveys which rated the local recurrence to the width of the intact margin around the tumour; they are aware of the decisive role of extensive intraductal component to have an influence on the local recurrence. Leaving out irradiation in selected groups is a part of the less aggressive tendency of breast cancer treatment. The omitment of the routine use of axillary dissection is under further consideration as well. The intraoperative mapping of lymph nodes looks promising in assessing their tumorous involvement. The prognostic role of dissection can be replaced by the immunoreactive hepatocyte growth factor.

During surgery, a monopolar electrode was inserted with an ultrasonic guide. One round of cauterization lasted for 10 seconds at 100 W, and was repeated until the tissue around the tumor became hyperechoic. The antitumor effect of the therapy was assessed by histological examination of resected liver tissues. Tumor coagulation and necrosis were observed to be consistent with the cauterized area. On CT scanning, treated areas were shown to be of low density and homogeneous.

Several choices are currently available to certain patient subsets that allow radiation oncologists to individualize care. Multiple phase II and several phase III trials have been published that support the safety and efficacy of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) as part of breast conservation in selected patients. In contrast, a recent large retrospective analysis of patients aged 67 or older who received brachytherapy for APBI has raised concerns about its effectiveness. As the radiation community awaits results from NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413, the largest randomized trial of whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) versus APBI, to provide more conclusive data, many academic and private radiation oncology practices are utilizing APBI off-protocol to treat early-stage breast cancer patients. Because of this, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) published a consensus statement in 2009 to aid in proper patient selection (Table 1). Until more definitive data is garnered, we advocate strict adherence to these selection criteria to ensure optimal outcomes. Specifically, we caution against the use of APBI in lymph node-positive disease outside of a clinical trial. There is a paucity of comparative data to guide oncologists in selection of the best APBI delivery method. The current NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 trial allows any of the three most common forms of delivery to be utilized (multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, balloon intracavitary brachytherapy, and external beam 3D conformal therapy) and will be instrumental to compare outcome differences between these methods.",eng,0
Journal Article,V. S. Klimberg; S. Harms; S. Korourian,1999.0,Assessing margin status,", ","As little time ago as 1991 the NIH Consensus conference could not agree on the need for negative margins. Today, negative margin status has become a prerequisite for BCT recognizing that positive margins impact negatively on local recurrence rates. The science of margin evaluation is fast becoming recognized to play a key role in providing patients with the opportunity for breast conservation therapy as well as the best possible cosmetic result. Preoperative factors that predict a greater likelihood of failure to obtain margins such as larger tumor size and positive lymph nodes are fixed and can only be dealt with by taking larger biopsies. RODEO-MRI can preoperatively predict probability of success or failure and can actual better define tumor dimensions and extent and help plan excisions. Use of intraoperative US may be a future tool used to facilitate the excision of non-palpable and possibly palpable tumors. Intraoperative pathological assessment should not be performed by frozen section but consideration given to cytological assessment so as to allow feedback to the surgeon intraoperatively as to which margin needs more attention. Finally, using all the above methods of obtaining negative margins, the surgeon may have the ability to impact the outcome of breast cancer surgery and recurrence.",eng,0

We hypothesized that eRFA after lumpectomy for invasive breast cancer could reduce the need for re-excision for close margins as well as potentially maintain local control without the need for radiation. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective phase II institutional review board-approved study was conducted from March 2004 to April 2010. A standard lumpectomy was performed, then the RFA probe was deployed 1 cm circumferentially into the walls of the lumpectomy cavity and maintained at 100 degrees C for 15 minutes. Validated Doppler sonography was used to intraoperatively determine adequacy of ablation. RESULTS: One hundred patients were accrued to the trial, with an average age of 65.02 years +/- 10.0 years. The stages were Tis (n = 30); T1mic (n = 1); T1a (n = 9); T1b (n = 27); T1c (n = 22); T2 (n = 10) ; and T3 (n = 1). Grades were I (n = 48); II (n = 29); and III (n = 23). Seventy-eight subjects had margins >2 mm (negative), 22 patients had margins </= 2 mm, of which 12 were close and 3 focally positive, which, at our institution, would have required re-excision (only 1 patient in this group had re-excision). There were 6% postoperative complications, and 24 patients received radiation therapy (XRT). During the study mean follow-up period of 62 months +/- 24 months (68-month median follow-up) in patients not treated with XRT, there were 2 in-site tumor recurrences treated with aromitase inhibitor, 3 biopsy entrance site recurrences treated with excision and XRT to conserve the breast, and 2 recurrences elsewhere and 1 contralateral recurrence; all 3 treated with mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up suggests that eRFA may reduce the need for re-excision for close or focally positive margins in breast cancer patients, and eRFA may be a valuable tool for treating favorable patients who desire lumpectomy and either cannot or do not want radiation.

The expected local recurrence rate in 5 year followup is 7.6%, after adding a boost irradiation of the index region with a dose of 10 to 16 Gray 4.3%. The boost irradiation as an intraoperative procedure using the Intrabeam device showed a further decrease of local recurrence rates down to 1.75% in 5 year follow up. In our study we investigated the influence of this procedure on the duration of the operation, the postoperative hospitalisation and the cosmetic results. Methods: We collected the data of the first 200 patients treated with the Intrabeam device during breast conserving therapy in our institution since April 2010. 60 (30 %) of the 200 patients had been treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/- Trastuzumab. After the end of the whole breast irradiation we collected data concerning the satisfaction of the patients and their doctors with the cosmetic outcome. To investigate the influence on the duration of the operation and the hospital stay, we then compared the data of the first 200 patients treated with the Intrabeam with the data of 200 patients, who had breast conserving therapy, before we started using the Intrabeam but who would have been feasible for intraoperative radiotherapy. Results: The data concerning the satisfaction with the cosmetic result are described in table 1. (Table presented) The average duration of the surgical procedure was 99.61 min in the cohort with intraoperative radiotherapy.We could see a learning curve between the first 100 and the second 100 cases. In the first 100 cases the time duration was 104.29 min, in the second 100 cases this time was markedly shorter with 94.93 min. The average duration of the operation in the cohort without intraoperative radiotherapy was 67.07 min. The average prolongation of the duration of the surgical procedure was 32.54 min. The hospital stay differed moderately with 2.2 days without and 3.3 days with intraoperative radiotherapy. The reason for the prolongation in most of the cases was a need for a later removal of the drainage in the intraoperatively radiated patients. Conclusions: Intraoperative Radiotherapy with the Intrabeam device is easy to integrate into daily clinical practice. The prolongation of the duration of the surgical procedure of about half an hour and of the hospital stay of one day are absolutely tolerable if seen in relation to the expected better local control. The satisfaction with the cosmetic result in 92% of the patients and 95% of the physicians is an indicator, that intraoperative radiotherapy doesn't lead to a compromise in the oncoplastic approach.",,0

The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival was significantly better by 15% with TARGIT: TARGIT 2 events 96.7%(95%CI 87.5 - 99.2), EBRT 9 events 81.7% (95%CI 67.6 - 90.1), HR 0.19 (0.04 - 0.87), log rank p = 0.016, mainly due to a reduction of 10.1% in non-breast-cancer mortality: TARGIT 0 events 0%, EBRT 89.9% (77.3 - 95.7), HR (not calculable), log rank p = 0.015. There was also a 17.5% improvement in distant disease free survival: TARGIT 7 events 88.5% (77.4 - 94.4), EBRT 12 events, 71.0% (52.0 - 83.6), HR 0.53(0.20-1.36), log rank p = 0.18. Conclusions: TARGIT-IORT during lumpectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is safe and may lead to superior overall survival. These data support the much debated idea that TARGIT-IORT may have beneficial systemic effects, a hypothesis that is being tested in the TARGIT-B(oost) international randomised trial.",,0

We don't know the impact of the different partial breast irradiation techniques. We therefore compared the QoL parameters 'pain and fatigue' for external beam APBI and IORT in our phase 2 (feasibility) study. Materials and Methods: Eligible patients were women aged 60 years or older with unilateral breast cancer with tumor stage Tis, T1 or T2 less than 3 cm treated within the context of a phase II study. For practical reasons using external beam APBI in one hospital, 10 daily fractions of 3.85 Gy, and IORT in the other hospital, 23.3 Gy in one fraction with electrons (ELIOT). Both APBI and IORT patients have been followed prospectively with the same QoL questionnaires: 1 week, 3 months, 6 months and yearly after breast conserving treatment. Results: In November 2014 the IORT part of the study accrued 192 patients; the APBI part 86 patients. The overall response for the QoL questionnaires was 82-98% at the different time points. There is a non-significant (ns) difference in pain score (VAS 1- 10) 1 week after surgery in favor of APBI patients. After completion of radiotherapy this difference is significant in favor of the APBI patients, maybe due to wound healing in the 4 to 5 weeks after breast conserving surgery. In time this difference changes, resulting in a significant difference in favor of IORT at 3 and 6 months. For fatigue (EORTC C30) the results are comparable; more patients are tired (ns) just after surgery for IORT, but again less tired at 6 and 12 months. In the explorative analysis, so far, co morbidity, not age, seems to influence fatigue. Correcting for co morbidity fatigue at 6 and 12 months is significant better for IORT. Conclusions: This preliminary analysis shows a significant better result for pain and fatigue for IORT compared to external beam APBI in the first year of follow up. An update of the results will be presented including the analysis of the confounding factors. (Table Presented).",,0

Rosenthal,2014.0,Use of monoclonal antibody-IRDye800CW bioconjugates in the resection of breast cancer,10.1016/j.jss.2013.11.1089,"BACKGROUND: Complete surgical resection of breast cancer is a powerful determinant of patient outcome, and failure to achieve negative margins results in reoperation in between 30% and 60% of patients. We hypothesize that repurposing Food and Drug Administration-approved antibodies as tumor-targeting diagnostic molecules can function as optical contrast agents to identify the boundaries of malignant tissue intraoperatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The monoclonal antibodies bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab, trastuzumab, and tocilizumab were covalently linked to a near-infrared fluorescence probe (IRDye800CW) and in vitro binding assays were performed to confirm ligand-specific binding. Nude mice bearing human breast cancer flank tumors were intravenously injected with the antibody-IRDye800 bioconjugates and imaged over time. Tumor resections were performed using the SPY and Pearl Impulse systems, and the presence or absence of tumor was confirmed by conventional and fluorescence histology. RESULTS: Tumor was distinguishable from normal tissue using both SPY and Pearl systems, with both platforms being able to detect tumor as small as 0.5 mg. Serial surgical resections demonstrated that real-time fluorescence can differentiate subclinical segments of disease. Pathologic examination of samples by conventional and optical histology using the Odyssey scanner confirmed that the bioconjugates were specific for tumor cells and allowed accurate differentiation of malignant areas from normal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Human breast cancer tumors can be imaged in vivo with multiple optical imaging platforms using near-infrared fluorescently labeled antibodies. These data support additional preclinical investigations for improving the surgical resection of malignancies with the goal of eventual clinical translation.",eng,0

Materials and methods: Six (6) patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral breast conservation surgery to remove cancerous or benign tumors. All patients received hydrogel application following primary tumor excision. Imaging performed in the first postoperative week included ultrasound,MRI andCT. Breast cosmesis scores and ultrasound findings were obtained at one and three months following surgery. Results: While preliminary, a relationship between percent cavity filling and drainage was observed, with 30% or more cavity filling resulting in decreased drainage. Additionally, the hydrogel was readily visible under ultrasound, MRI and CT imaging modalities. There were no significant complications in the 3 months follow up. All of the patients were very satisfied with the postoperative outcome using a visual analogue scale. Finally, surgeons felt that patient cosmesis was improved relative to their prior experience. Conclusions: Initial data suggests that hydrogel filling may reduce excision cavity drainage, which may reduce seroma or hematoma formation. Additionally, these gels may improve cavity visibility and stability, furthering the use of partial breast irradiation. Finally, while more studies are required, these materials may have a role in guiding the radiation of the tumor bed in breast cancer patients and could be an alternative to the concept of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). Furthermore, the use of the hydrogel used consisting of polyethylene glycol-which is established as a barrier method in adhesion prevention-may also improve long term patient cosmesis.",,0

The authors' initial NSM guidelines included risk reduction and cancers 2 cm or smaller located more than 2 cm from the nipple. The relative contraindications included obesity, large and/or ptotic breasts, and prior radiation. This study aimed to evaluate changes over time in NSM indications, surgical approach, and early outcomes. METHODS: After institutional review board approval, the study identified 354 patients scheduled for 588 NSMs, 341 (96%) of whom underwent 566 NSMs. Changes across time [early (2009-2010), mid (2011-2012), and recent (2013-6/2014)] were assessed using tests for linear trend. RESULTS: For patients undergoing reconstruction, NSMs increased from 24% (early) to 40% (recent) (p = 0.004). Among the NSM patients, average body mass index, proportion with bra cup sizes of C or larger, and prior radiation increased significantly over time. Performance of NSM for tumors 2 cm or less from the nipple increased from 5 to 18%, and after neoadjuvant therapy, from 8 to 21.5% (p = 0.02). Use of inframammary, radial, and reduction-type incisions increased over time, together with intraoperative laser angiography (both p < 0.0001). Concomitantly, the overall complication rate, complications requiring treatment, and postoperative nipple loss decreased. During a median follow-up period of 19 months, five locoregional recurrences (LRR) were observed, for an estimated 2-year LRR rate of 1.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0-3.9%]. CONCLUSIONS: Over time, the indications for NSM expanded in terms of patient characteristics, tumor stage, and prior therapy, whereas the complication rates decreased. Excellent short-term outcomes suggest that NSM is a reasonable approach for many risk-reduction and cancer patients without disease in the nipple-areolar complex. Further study is needed to assess long-term aesthetics, patient satisfaction, and oncologic safety.",eng,0

To date there are only limited data available on breast cancer patients treated with IORT using low energy X-rays. We analyzed toxicity and cosmesis after IORT as a boost with a minimum follow-up of 18 months. Methods and Materials: A total of 73 patients treated with IORT (20 Gy/50 kV X-rays; INTRABEAM [Carl Zeiss Surgical, Oberkochen, Germany]) to the tumor bed during breast-conserving surgery as a boost followed by whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT, 46 Gy) underwent a prospective, predefined follow-up (median, 25 months; range 18-44 months), including clinical examination and breast ultrasound at 6-months and mammographies at 1-year intervals. Toxicities were documented using the common toxicity criteria (CTC)/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the LENT-SOMA score. Cosmesis was evaluated with a score from 1 to 4. Results: The IORT in combination with WBRT was well tolerated, with no Grade 3 or 4 skin toxicities and no telangiectasias. Fibrosis of the entire breast was observed in 5% of the patients. A circumscribed fibrosis around the tumor bed was palpable in up to 27% with a peak around 18 months after therapy and a decline thereafter. The observed toxicitiy rates were not influenced by age, tumor stage, or systemic therapy. The cosmetic outcome was good to excellent in >90% of cases.

The normal tissue tolerance does not permit a second full-dose course of radiotherapy to the entire breast after a second breast-conserving surgery (BCS). A novel option is to treat these patients with partial breast irradiation (PBI). This approach is based on the hypothesis that re-irradiation of a limited volume will be effective and result in an acceptable frequency of side effects. The following report presents a single center experience with intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) during excision of recurrent breast cancer in the previously irradiated breast. Methods: Between 4/02 and 11/06, 15 patients were treated for in-breastrecurrences at a median of 10 years (3-25) after previous EBRT (10 recurrences in the initial tumor bed, 3 elsewhere in-breast failures, 2 invasive recurrences after previous DCIS). Additional 2 patients were selected for IORT with new primary breast cancer after previous partial breast EBRT for treatment of Hodgkin's disease. IORT with a single dose of 14.7 - 20 Gy 50 kV X-rays at the applicator surface was delivered with the IntrabeamTM-device (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Results: After a median follow-up of 26 months (1-60), no local recurrence occurred. 14 out of 17 patients are alive and free of disease progression. Two patients are alive with distant metastases. One patient died 26 months after BCS/IORT due to pulmonary metastases diagnosed 19 months after BCS/IORT. Acute toxicity after IORT was mild with no Grade 3/4 toxicities and cosmetic outcome showed excellent/good/fair results in 7/7/3 cases. Conclusion: IORT for recurrent breast cancer using low energy X-rays is a valuable option for patients with recurrent breast cancer after previous radiotherapy. © 2007 Kraus-Tiefenbacher et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,0

This modality differs from conventional fractionated radiotherapy in irradiating the tumor bed with a single protracted dose of irradiation. Therefore IORT of the tumor bed after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) might possibly be associated with higher rates of wound seroma. Methods: One hundred fifty-six patients with breast cancer transferred to our department betweeen 2005 and 2007 were analyzed regarding the occurrence of breast seroma. Seventy-four patients had undergone IORT during BCS (IORT group), 82 had BCS without IORT (EBRT group). All patients had a CT scan for treatment planning 3-6 weeks after BCS. Seroma was verified by clinical examination and/or CT scan. Clinical and treatment-related factors were analyzed including patient age, body mass index (BMI), breast volume, index quadrant, and interval between surgery and radiotherapy. Results: Median patient age was 63.8 years for the IORT group and 62.6 for the EBRT group. BMI < 24.9, 25-29.9, and >30 was almost equally distributed in both groups. Both groups had 20% patients with a BMI over 30. Breast volume on average was 1193 cc and 1073 cc, respectively. Clinical palpable seroma in the IORT group were evident in 17 patients (22%), 3 of them (14%) had to be treated by puncture, whereas 20 patients (24%) of the EBRT group had palpable seroma and 10 of them (12%) had to be treated. Only detected via CT scan without clinical relevance were 45 seroma (58%) and 23 (27%), respectively. Neither clinical nor radiological seroma had 15 (20%) and 41 (49%), respectively. A subanalysis of the data regarding the 3 BMI groups showed no significant correlation between BMI and seroma. Conclusions: IORT of the tumor bed doesn't seem to increase the rate of clinical relevant seroma compared to a normal control group, but the fluid seen in CT scans (without any clinical relevance) are up to twice as much as in non-IORT patients, especially in obese patients. Other factors have yet to be statistically analyzed.",,0

Materials and methods: Between February 2002 and June 2003 57 breast cancer patients, all eligible for breast conserving surgery (BCS), were treated at the Mannheim Medical Center with IORT using the mobile X-ray system IntrabeamTM. The patient population in this feasibility study was not homogeneous consisting of 49 patients with primary stage I or II breast cancer, seven with local recurrence after previous EBRT and one with a second primary in a previously irradiated breast. The selection criteria for referral for IORT included tumor size, tumor cavity size, margin status and absence of an extensive intraductal component. The previously irradiated patients with local recurrences and 16 others received IORT as single modality. In all other cases IORT was followed by EBRT with a total dose of 46 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. The intraoperatively delivered dose after tumor resection was 20 Gy prescribed to the applicator surface. EBRT was delivered with a standard two-tangential-field technique using linear accelerators with 6- or 18-MV photons. Patients were assessed every three months by their radiation oncologist or surgeon during the first year after treatment and every six months thereafter. Breast ultrasound for follow-up was done every six months and mammographies once yearly. Acute side effects were scored according to the CTC/EORTC score and late side effects according to the Lent-Soma classification. Results: Twenty-four patients received IORT only; eight patients because they had received previous radiotherapy, 16 because of a very favorable risk profile or their own preference. Thirty-three patients with tumor sizes between 1 and 30 mm and no risk factors were treated by IORT as a boost followed by EBRT. The IntrabeamTM system was used for IORT. The Intrabeam source produces 30-50 KV X-rays and the prescribed dose is delivered in an isotropic dose distribution around spherical applicators. Treatment time ranged between 20 and 48 minutes. No severe acute side effects or complications were observed during the first postoperative days or after 12 months. One local recurrence occurred 10 months after surgery plus IORT followed by EBRT. In two patients distant metastases were diagnosed shortly after BCS. Discussion: IORT with the Intrabeam system is a feasible method to deliver a single high radiation dose to breast cancer patients. As a preliminary boost it has the advantage of reducing the EBRT course by 1.5 weeks, and as APBI it might be a promising tool for patients with a low risk of recurrence. The treatment is well tolerated and does not cause greater damage than the expected late reaction in normal tissue.",,1

Methods and Materials: Seventy-one patients with 73 breast cancers (IORT group) treated with IORT (20 Gy Intrabeam) as a boost during BCS were compared with 86 patients with 88 breast tumors (NO-IORT group) treated without IORT. Clinical examination and measurement of seroma volume on treatment-planning CT (CT-seroma) was done at median interval of 35 days after BCS. Results: Seroma were found on palpation in 37 patients (23%) and on CT in 105 patients (65%; median volume, 26.3 mL). Interval between BCS and CT was significantly shorter in patients with palpable seroma (median, 33 days) or CT-seroma (33 days) compared with those with no palpable seroma (36.5 days; p = 0.027) or CT-seroma (52 days, p < 0.001). The rate of palpable seroma was not different (IORT n = 17, 23%; NO-IORT n = 20, 23%; p = 0.933), whereas fewer patients required puncture in the IORT group [3 (4%) vs. 10 (11%)]. In contrast, more patients showed CT-seroma after IORT (IORT n = 59, 81%; NO-IORT n = 46, 52%; p < 0.001). The interval between BCS and CT was significantly shorter in patients with IORT as compared with the NO-IORT patients (median, 33 days vs. 41.5 days; p = 0.036). Conclusion: Intraoperative radiotherapy with low-kilovoltage X-rays during BCS is not associated with an increased rate of palpable seroma or seroma requiring treatment. The rate of seroma formation on CT was higher after IORT compared with the NO-IORT group, which might be because of the shorter interval between BCS and CT. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, the simplicity of the treatment process does not eliminate the need for proper attention to the technical aspects of the treatment. One of the potential pitfalls is incorrect selection of the appropriate applicator size to adequately cover the tumor bed to the prescription dose. Case of large treatment area, such as sarcoma, often requires abutting two fields together. It might be beneficial to select larger applicator to avoid potential mistreatment problems which are often underestimated. Similar problems can appear while treating early stage breast tumors. There is a natural tendency to select an applicator as small as possible so as not to jeopardize cosmesis. Methods: This investigation questions how much of the typical treatment volume gets adequate exposure and what is the correct strategy in selecting the proper applicator size. Actual data from isodose scans were analyzed. Results: We found that typical treatment dose prescriptions can cover as much as 80% and as little as 20% of the nominal treatment volume depending on the applicator size and energy of the beam and whether the dose is prescribed to the 80 or 90% isodose level. Treatment volume is defined as a cylinder with diameter equal to applicator and height equal to the corresponding D80 or D90 depth. Variations of the treatment intensity during field abutment are much stronger than is usually believed and significant percentage of the treatment volume in the center of the tumor bed might be significantly under or over exposed. Conclusion: If mobile linear accelerators are used, there can be significant amount of 'cold volume' depending on the applicator size and this should be taken into account when selecting the applicator that is needed. Using too small of an applicator could result in significant underdosing to the tissue at risk. Long-term clinical data demonstrates that selecting an adequate field size results in good oncologic control as well as excellent cosmesis.",,0

Ultrasound-guided surgery has the potential to resolve both of these problems, thereby improving surgical accuracy for palpable breast cancer. We aimed to compare ultrasound-guided surgery with the standard for palpable breast cancer-palpation-guided surgery-with respect to margin status and extent of healthy breast tissue resection. METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, patients with palpable T1-T2 invasive breast cancer were recruited from six medical centres in the Netherlands between October, 2010, and March, 2012. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to either ultrasound-guided surgery or palpation-guided surgery in a 1:1 ratio via a computer-generated random sequence and were stratified by study centre. Patients and investigators were aware of treatment assignments. Primary outcomes were surgical margin involvement, need for additional treatment, and excess healthy tissue resection (defined with a calculated resection ratio derived from excision volume and tumour diameter). Data were analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered at http://www.TrialRegister.nl, number NTR2579. FINDINGS: 134 patients were eligible for random allocation. Two (3%) of 65 patients allocated ultrasound-guided surgery had tumour-involved margins compared with 12 (17%) of 69 who were assigned palpation-guided surgery (difference 14%, 95% CI 4-25; p=0.0093). Seven (11%) patients who received ultrasound-guided surgery and 19 (28%) of those who received palpation-guided surgery required additional treatment (17%, 3-30; p=0.015). Ultrasound-guided surgery also resulted in smaller excision volumes (38 [SD 26] vs 57 [41] cm(3); difference 19 cm(3), 95% CI 7-31; p=0.002) and a reduced calculated resection ratio (1.0 [SD 0.5] vs 1.7 [1.2]; difference 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.0; p=0.0001) compared with palpation-guided surgery. INTERPRETATION: Compared with palpation-guided surgery, ultrasound-guided surgery can significantly lower the proportion of tumour-involved resection margins, thus reducing the need for re-excision, mastectomy, and radiotherapy boost. By achieving optimum resection volumes, ultrasound-guided surgery reduces unnecessary resection of healthy breast tissue and could contribute to improved cosmetic results and quality of life.

In this survey we analysed breast treatments. Materials and Methods: Since 2007, we collected demographic, clinical and technical data related to IORT procedures in a common database. Prospective and retrospective data entry was possible. The current study analysed 6,816 breast tumours. Results: Breast tumours represent 80.3% of all data of the ISIORT survey that encompassed 8,493 IORT procedures performed from 1992 to 2014. Median age of breast patients was 61.1 years (range 16-90). Gender was female in 99.7% and male in 0.3% of cases. In 6,702 cases (98.3%), IORT was a component of radical treatment for primary, newly diagnosed disease and in 114 cases (1.7%), it was an attempt to rescue localized recurrent breast cancer. IORT was performed as a boost before or after EBRT in 3,258 cases (47.8%) with doses of 8-12 Gy. In 3,558 cases (52.6%), IORT was used as single radiation treatment modality with doses of 18 Gy, 20 Gy or 21 Gy. The patients enrolled in study protocols represented 33% of those treated by a single dose and 6.3% of those treated by a boost dose. IORT was delivered after and before tumour removal in 39% and 61% of cases, respectively. In 6,406 cases (94%), IORT was performed using electrons of 4-12 MeV energy. The most used applicators (77% of cases) were 5 or 6 cm in diameter and bevel angle was 0degree in the majority of cases (88%). Four hundred and ten cases (6% of patients) were treated with a 50-kV x-ray source in a single centre. X-rays treatments were delivered by a spherical applicator inserted into the surgical cavity after tumour removal. Conclusions: At present, the ISIORT database represents the largest clinical and technical IORT data collection. Breast cancer is the most frequent IORT treatment performed in the 34 participating centres. From this analysis, it emerged that in most cases IORT was used as single shoot of 18-21 Gy, the most employed treatment modality was electron beam and the procedure was most frequently performed after tumour removal. Only a minority of patients was included in clinical trials. Further data analyses could enhance multi-institutional performance and serve as a basis for designing clinical trials in an effort to define the role of IORT in tailored multimodality therapeutic approaches.",,0

Ringel,2013.0,Reliability of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring using motor evoked potentials during resection of metastases in motor-eloquent brain regions: clinical article,10.3171/2013.2.jns121752,"OBJECT: Resection of gliomas in or adjacent to the motor system is widely performed using intraoperative neuromonitoring (IOM). For resection of cerebral metastases in motor-eloquent regions, however, data are sparse and IOM in such cases is not yet widely described. Since recent studies have shown that cerebral metastases infiltrate surrounding brain tissue, this study was undertaken to assess the value and influence of IOM during resection of supratentorial metastases in motor-eloquent regions. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2011, the authors resected 206 consecutive supratentorial metastases, including 56 in eloquent motor areas with monitoring of monopolar direct cortically stimulated motor evoked potentials (MEPs). The authors evaluated the relationship between the monitoring data and the course of surgery, clinical data, and postoperative imaging. RESULTS: Motor evoked potential monitoring was successful in 53 cases (93%). Reduction of MEP amplitude correlated better with postoperative outcomes when the threshold for significant amplitude reduction was set at 80% (only > 80% reduction was considered significant decline) than when it was set at 50% (> 50% amplitude reduction was considered significant decline). Evidence of residual tumor was seen on MR images in 28% of the cases with significant MEP reduction. No residual tumor was seen in any case of stable MEP monitoring. Moreover, preoperative motor deficit, recursive partitioning analysis Class 3, and preoperative radiotherapy were independent risk factors for a new surgery-related motor weakness (occurring in 64% of patients with and 11% of patients without radiotherapy, p > 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous MEP monitoring provides reliable monitoring of the motor system and also influences the course of operation in resection of cerebral metastases. However, in establishing warning criteria, only an amplitude decline > 80% of the baseline should be considered significant.",eng,0

Robb,2004.0,Delayed-immediate breast reconstruction,", ","In patients with early-stage breast cancer who are scheduled to undergo mastectomy and desire breast reconstruction, the optimal timing of reconstruction depends on whether postmastectomy radiation therapy will be needed. Immediate reconstruction offers the best aesthetic outcomes if postmastectomy radiation therapy is not needed, but if postmastectomy radiation therapy is required, delayed reconstruction is preferable to avoid potential aesthetic and radiation-delivery problems. Unfortunately, the need for postmastectomy radiation therapy cannot be reliably determined until review of the permanent tissue sections. The authors recently implemented a two-stage approach, delayed-immediate breast reconstruction, to optimize reconstruction in patients at risk for requiring postmastectomy radiation therapy when the need for postmastectomy radiation therapy is not known at the time of mastectomy. Stage 1 consists of skin-sparing mastectomy with insertion of a completely filled textured saline tissue expander. After review of permanent sections, patients who did not require post-mastectomy radiation therapy underwent immediate reconstruction (stage 2) and patients who required postmastectomy radiation therapy completed postmastectomy radiation therapy and then underwent standard delayed reconstruction. In this study, the feasibility and outcomes of this approach were reviewed. Fourteen patients were treated with delayed-immediate reconstruction between May of 2002 and June of 2003. Twelve patients had unilateral reconstruction and two patients had bilateral reconstruction, for a total of 16 treated breasts. All patients completed stage 1. Tissue expanders were inserted subpectorally in 15 breasts and subcutaneously in one breast. The mean intraoperative expander fill volume was 475 cc (range, 250 to 750 cc). Three patients required postmastectomy radiation therapy and underwent delayed reconstruction. Eleven patients did not require postmastectomy radiation therapy. Nine patients had 11 breast reconstructions (stage 2), six with free transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flaps, one with a superior gluteal artery perforator flap, and four with a latissimus dorsi flap plus an implant. The median interval between stages was 13 days (range, 11 to 22 days). Two patients who did not require postmastectomy radiation therapy have not yet had stage 2 reconstruction, one because she wished to delay reconstruction and the other because she required additional tissue expansion before permanent implant placement. Six complications occurred. The stage 1 complications involved two cases of mastectomy skin necrosis in patients who required post-mastectomy radiation therapy; one patient required removal of the subcutaneously placed expander before postmastectomy radiation therapy and the other patient had a subpectorally placed expander that only required local wound care. The stage 2 complications were a recipient-site seroma in a patient with a latissimus dorsi flap, a recipient-site hematoma in the patient with the superior gluteal artery perforator flap, and two arterial thromboses in patients with TRAM flaps. Both TRAM flaps were salvaged. Delayed-immediate reconstruction is technically feasible and safe in patients with early-stage breast cancer who may require postmastectomy radiation therapy. With this approach, patients who do not require postmastectomy radiation therapy can achieve aesthetic outcomes essentially the same as those with immediate reconstruction, and patients who require postmastectomy radiation therapy can avoid the aesthetic and radiation-delivery problems that can occur after an immediate breast reconstruction.",eng,0

The advantage of post-pathology is the ability to determine eligibility based on margins, pathologic tumor size and nodal status, prior to delivering radiation. However, it is unclear whether having more than one operation before IORT is associated with worse skin toxicity. In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship of the number of operations and skin toxicities in women receiving IORT. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 57 consecutive patients who underwent IORT from 2009-2013. All patients received 20 Gy in 1 fraction prescribed to the applicator surface using the Carl Zeiss Intrabeam System. Skin toxicities were determined using CTCAE 4.0 and RTOG criteria. In addition, infection, skin erythema, desquamation, symptomatic seroma, and necrosis were scored individually and used as outcome measures. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to assess the association of the number of operations and skin toxicities. A multivariate analysis was performed and included age, applicator size, max skin dose, number of operations, DM, HTN, BMI, co-morbidity, and depth from skin on mammogram as variables. Results: The median follow-up was 11 months (range 1-33). The median age and applicator size were 68 yrs (range 49-85) and 4 cm (range 2.5-5). 20 (35%) patients had 1 operation (lumpectomy, SLNB and Intrabeam all in 1 setting). 36 (63%) patients had 2 operations (initial surgery, followed by Intrabeam +/- margin re-excision). One (2%) patient had 3 operations (initial surgery, re-excision, followed by Intrabeam). On univariate analysis, the number of operations was associated with increased infection (p = 0.044), but not other skin toxicities. On multivariate analysis, the association was no longer significant (p = 0.97). Conclusions: Our study suggests that delivering IORT post-pathology was not associated with worse acute or late skin complications. Delivering IORT after the initial operation decreases the uncertainty of margin status and avoids the controversy of excising an irradiated positive margin and/or the need for additional whole breast radiation.",,0

Giunta,2011.0,[Preoperative CT angiography for planning free perforator flaps in breast reconstruction],10.1055/s-0031-1275282,"Preoperative Doppler ultrasonography for planning free perforator flaps is widely established to identify preoperatively perforators. The method allows one to localise the penetrating point of the perforator through the abdominal fascia. By this means it is not possible to see the intramuscular course or the position of the perforator in relation to the inferior epigastric artery. Lately the technique of computed tomographic angiography provides an opportunity for visualising the course of perforator vessels in these tissues. This paper summarises our experience with the preoperative CT angiography in our breast centre. Since spring 2009 we have reconstructed the breasts of 44 female patients by using free flaps from the lower abdominal wall. 6 of these were bilateral. In a total number of 50 breast reconstructions we used 23 deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps and 27 muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM) flaps. In addition to the preoperative ultrasonography, a CT angiography of the lower abdomen was conducted in 29 patients. On average they showed at least 2 perforators on the left as well as right abdominal sides, which could be used as flap vessels based on their signal intensity. Based on their estimated microsurgical dissection complexity, the perforator vessels could be classified into 3 groups: 1) direct perforators of category A with short intramuscular course (39%), 2) perforators with long intramuscular course of category B (50%) and 3) turn around"" perforators of category C, which pass medially around the rectus abdominis (11%). The technique of CT angiography permits a reliable preoperative visualisation of perforators in their entire course and facilitates the selection of the supplying perforator as well as the intraoperative procedure for the surgeon. The suggested classification of perforators into 3 groups simplifies the preoperative assessment of the microsurgical dissection effort. Compared to the commonly used Doppler ultrasonography there are disadvantages like the additional cost factor and the radiation exposure. However, in our experience the more detailed planning increases the safety of flap raising and reduces surgery time, so that we consider CT angiography a positive tool to facilitate free perforator flaps.""",ger,0

Vicini,2004.0,Accelerated partial breast irradiation after conservative surgery for breast cancer,", ","OBJECTIVE: To critically review the theoretical and actual risks and benefits of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) after breast-conserving surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Because of rapid evolution of radiation therapy techniques related to brachytherapy and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, APBI has very recently come to the forefront as a potential local treatment option for women with breast cancer. This review aims to give an overview of the biologic rationale for APBI techniques, and benefits and limitations of APBI techniques. METHODS: The authors reviewed the currently available published world medical literature on breast-conserving surgery with and without postoperative irradiation; all studies involving partial breast irradiation, including brachytherapy, for breast cancer; and currently accruing and planned APBI trials. The focus of this review was the early results of treatment in terms of toxicity, complications, cosmesis, and local control. RESULTS: On average, approximately 3% of patients treated with breast-conserving surgery will have an in-breast local recurrence away from the original lumpectomy site with or without postoperative standard whole-breast irradiation. The results of phase I-II studies involving approximately 500 patients treated with APBI after breast-conserving surgery have been published. Although many of the studies have limited long-term follow-up and potential selection bias, early results suggest that toxicity, cosmesis, and local control are comparable to outcomes seen after breast-conserving surgery followed by standard whole-breast irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Recent advances in radiation delivery and published series of partial breast irradiation support large randomized trials comparing APBI with standard whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery.",eng,0

In the pre-operative setting, structural imaging studies are needed to delineate the extent of disease as accurately as possible. For neoadjuvant treatment, many different concepts have been established or are being developed that target at different molecular pathways. Ideally, an imaging tool should be able to provide information on response to specific molecular pathways and it should help predict response and identify response as early as possible. PET has traditionally been perceived as a functional"" imaging tool for response prediction and assessment. New, specific molecular targets are being developed and evaluated in translational research that target at anti-angiogenetic and growth factor receptor signalling pathways. However, functional MR-based technologies like dynamic contrast enhanced MRI, Diffusion weighted MRI, Perfusion MRI, MR based oxygen mapping, and MR spectroscopy have been introduced that appear to exhibit a similar sensitivity for the pathophysiological processes associated with cancer growth and response to treatment. For the second scenario, i.e. pre-operative staging of primary or residual breast cancer, MRI has been an established role to guide surgical treatment. The importance of an accurate staging will be even increase with the increasing use of more regional therapies such as intraoperative radiotherapy. This lecture will cover recent results on MRI for tailoring treatment of breast cancer and will address current controversies.""",,0

The 2011 Oxford overview shows that the risk of first recurrence is halved in all age groups by adjuvant RT after breast-conserving surgery, although the absolute benefit in older 'low-risk' patients is small. There is level 1 evidence that a breast boost after breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation reduces local recurrence in older as in younger women, although in the former the absolute reduction is modest. Partial breast irradiation (external beam or intraoperative or postoperative brachytherapy) is potentially an attractive option for older patients, but the evidence base is insufficient to recommend it routinely. Similarly, shortened (hypofractionated) dose fraction schedules may be more convenient for older patients and are supported by level 1 evidence. There remains uncertainty about whether there is a subgroup of older low-risk patients in whom postoperative RT can be omitted after breast-conserving surgery. Biomarkers of 'low risk' are needed to refine the selection of patients for the omission of adjuvant RT. The role of postmastectomy irradiation is well established for 'high-risk' patients but uncertain in the intermediate-risk category of patients with 1-3 involved axillary nodes or node-negative patients with other risk factors where its role is investigational.

Kunkler,2015.0,Technical innovation in adjuvant radiotherapy: Evolution and evaluation of new treatments for today and tomorrow,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed17&AN=71865442","The disruptive impact of the role of radiotherapy in breast conserving therapy owes it origin to the work of Sir Geoffrey Keynes [1]. Following validation of safety and efficacy in clinical trials against mastectomy, there has been a progressive fall in local recurrence rates with breast conserving surgery (BCS) and postoperative whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) downto 2-3% at 5 years [2]. The trade off in improving local control is the increased risks of radiation induced cardiac morbidity [3] and mortality and of second malignancy [4]. Over the last decade technical developments in breast radiotherapy (intensity modulated radiotherapy, brachytherapy and intraoperative radiotherapy) have facilitated studies of partial breast irradiation (PBI) evaluating the concentration of radiation dose in and close to the tumour bed. Some of the early results of trials of accelerated partial breast irradiation (ABPI) have been disappointing. An interim report [5] of the RAPID trial comparing standard WBRT to ABPI (38.5 Gy in 10 bd fractions) showed inferior cosmetic results in the ABPI arm, suggesting that this dose fractionation regime was too intense. Intraoperative electron beam therapy when compared in the ELIOT trial to conventional WBRT resulted in inferior local control with IORT [6]. IORT using 50 X-rays in the TARGIT A trial also showed inferior local control with IORT compared to WBI [7], although the absolute difference small and longer term follow up is needed. Radiation can be delivered precisely to a defined target volume using IMRT or image guided radiotherapy, shaping the high dose region to the tumour or even sub regions within the tumor, while limiting dose to surrounding normal tissue. While there is level 1 evidence that IMRT delivers better cosmesis than standard RT [8], there is no evidence as yet that local control is improved. Looking forward, the main clinical dividends in local control and survival may come from three areas: i. Identification of molecular signatures of breast cancer radiosensitivity, allowing the exclusion from RT of patients unlikely to respond. The Radiotype Dx molecular signature of breast cancer radiosensitivity [9] looks promising but will require further validation. ii. Integrating stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant setting represents a novel approach in which ablative doses of focal radiation are delivered in a limited number of fractions (typically 5 or fewer). The sharp dose gradients limit radiation dose to surrounding normal tissues. The integration of preoperative SBRT in escalating doses with neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be safe in a phase 1 study and does not the increase the risks of operative complications after breast conserving surgery [10]. It is likely to be from an understanding of the complex physiology and signaling pathways which influence tumour growth and metastatic spread that opportunities for exploiting drug-radiation synergies are likely to emerge [11]. iii. Real time sensing of the hypoxic tumour microenvironment is a research priority [12]. Targeting hypoxic subvolumes with drug-radiation combinations may provide a new direction for CMT research. Candidate targets are the pH regulatory mechanisms of the breast cancer cell. It has been suggested that acidosis contributes to radiation resistance [13] and it has been shown that knock down of hypoxia induced CA IX and CA XII sensitises Chinese hamster fibroblasts to radiation by increasing intracellular acidosis. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase IX shows promise in preclinical breast cancer models including explants [14]. These might lead to preoperative 'window of opportunity' studies of inhibitors of pH regulatory mechanisms (including CA IX, CA XII, CA 11, MCT 4) in combination with neoadjuvant systemic therapy and image guided RT.",,0

Future clinical dividends in local control and survival may come from the identification of molecular signatures of breast cancer radiosensitivity, the development of predictive signatures and identification of immunohistochemical markers of risk of local recurrence. The importance of tumour heterogeneity is being increasingly recognized as an important factor in determining radiotherapy response and an improved understanding of the biology of the tumour microenvironment may identify targets that allow enhanced radiosensitisation or reversal of radioresistance when inhibited.

Materials/Methods: Six patients with multilumen balloon implant were treated with APBI. Five patients each had 5 surgical clips placed around the lumpectomy cavity, while one patient had 4 clips implanted. Treatment planning CT and daily CT for every morning fraction were obtained. For each patient, daily treatment CTs were fused with the treatment planning CT. A total of 29 daily CT images were obtained. The image registration was focused on aligning the lumens of the balloon. A balloon's-Eye-View was defined with the origin located at the center of the balloon, with X, Y and = axes pointing at lumen #4, #1 and #5, respectively. The positions of the surgical clips were evaluated on the fused CT images. Variations were analyzed in terms of the spatial changing in Euclidian coordinates (X, Y, Z), spherical coordinates (d, Q, F), and the radius difference from center (r). By projecting the original plan onto the obtained daily CT images, the percentage dose difference (D%) form the original dose (D) due to variations of surgical clips were recorded. Correlations among these parameters were statistically evaluated. Results: In this study, the displacements from a total of 141 surgical clips were recorded. Mean +/- 1 SD for X, Y, Z, d, Q, F, and r were 0.2 +/- 10.4, -1.2 +/- 10.1, 1.0 +/- 3.7, 12.5 +/- 8.3 (mm), 2.9 +/- 50.5, 6.4 +/- 23.3(o), and 0.5 +/- 2.2 (mm), respectively. Displacement along the long axis of the balloon (Z) had less deviation and there was a strong correlation coefficient between = and F (0.94, p < 0.005). The mean displacements at X, Y, and = were all close to 1 mm but the large variance at X and Y indicates large displacement of the clips over time which results in a large d (13.1 mm). The large variance in azimuthal angle Q indicates the change of tumor bed due to rotation of balloon along the long axis. The original mean dose to the clips was 5.61 +/- 1.3 Gy. The overall D% was >2.1 +/- 15.4% and it had a strong correlation with r (-0.94, p < 0.005), but had non-significant correlation with the rest of the parameters. A generalized linear model for longitudinal data with compound symmetry covariance structure was used to model D% with r, the results suggest that for a 1 mm increase in radius, there is a statistically significant 4.8% (0.35) decrease in dose per treatment. Conclusions: Using surgical clips as surrogates for the tumor bed position, even for large displacement in 3D, the distance along the radius line toward balloon center did not change significantly which made the overall percentage dose difference non-significant, therefore the tumor bed around balloon should therefore receive adequate coverage during the treatment course.",,0

Kalnicki,2014.0,Day to day treatment variations of accelerated partial breast brachytherapy using a multi-lumen balloon,10.5114/jcb.2014.42025,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the variations of multi-lumen balloon (MLB)-based brachytherapy from simulation day to treatment day and their dosimetric impacts during accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 42 CT images scanned from seven patients were evaluated with regards to daily variation due to of: 1) internal uncertainty: size and shape of balloon, seroma volume; 2) geometrical uncertainty-random: length of each catheter was measured for each fraction (total 70); 3) geometrical uncertainty-systematic: virtual systematic errors were tested by offsetting dwell positions. The original plans (as group A) had a mean value of 96.8% on V95 of the PTV_Eval. Plans were rerun (as group B) such that the mean value of the V95 was relaxed to 90.4%. By applying the reference plan to each daily CT image, variations of target coverage under different sources of error were evaluated. RESULTS: Shape and size of the balloon had means of < 1 mm decreased in diameter and < 0.4 cm(3) decreased in volume; the mean seroma volume increased by 0.2 cm(3). This internal variation has a mean of < 1% difference for both V90 and V95. The geometrical uncertainty made a mean deviation of 2.7 mm per root of sum of square. It caused the degradations of V90 and V95 by mean values of 1.0% and 1.2%, respectively. A systematic error of 3 mm and 4 mm would degrade both of V90 and V95 by 4% and 6%, respectively. The degradations on target coverage of the plans in group A were statistically the same as those in group B. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, APBI treatments with MLB based brachytherapy are precise from day to day. However, minor variation due to daily treatment uncertainties can still degrade tumor bed coverage to an unacceptable coverage when V95 of the original plan is close to 90%.",eng,0

Materials and Methods: Six patients were treated with Contura balloon brachytherapy twice daily for five days to a total dose of 34 Gy. Each patient had six CT scans, one reference simulation scan and five daily scans during treatment. Daily variances in terms of balloon size (Vballoon), skin-to-balloon distance (Dskin) and skin-to-rib distance (Drib) were evaluated for each scan compared with reference scan. Total length of each catheter was measured for each fraction (total 60). By applying the reference plan to each daily CT image, dose variations to PTV, tumor bed, skin, and rib were evaluated with and without daily catheter length correction. Results: In the study, 17% of the treatment CT images had a Vballoon change more than 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup>. Dskin and Drib varied by more than 5mmin 20% and 30% of treatment CTs, respectively. 17% of treatment fractions had a catheter length change of more than 2 mm. 10% of the skin and 13% of the rib received more than 125% prescription dose due to the change above. Without catheter length correction, 3% of V95 (% volume of PTV received 95% prescribed dose) had more than 2% coverage degradation, 10% of V150 (volume of PTV received 150% prescribed dose) increased by more than 3 cm<sup>3</sup> and 17% of V200 (volume of PTV received 200% prescribed dose) increased by more than 2 cm<sup>3</sup>. Degradation of V95 is weakly correlated with Vballoon, Dskin, Drib and the original V95 (-0.1, 0.15, 0.15 and 0.12, respectively). With catheter length correction, 32% of V95 had more than 2% coverage degradation, 12% of V150 increased by more than 3 cm<sup>3</sup> and 28% of V200 increased by more than 2 cm<sup>3</sup>. Degradation of V95 is strongly correlated with Vballoon, Drib and original V95 (-0.54, -0.28 and 0.47, respectively). Conclusions: Overall, APBI treatment with Contura balloon did not vary significantly from day to day. However, minor variation of daily treatment uncertainties can still degrade tumor bed coverage from acceptable (V95>90%) to unacceptable, especially when the reference plan is in the board line of acceptable coverage.

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) allows irradiation of the tumour bed during the BCS, without the risk of so-called geographical error, with minimal exposure to adjacent tissues. Aim: Purpose of the study is to summarize 6 year of experience with BCS and IORT in patients treated for early breast cancer. Materials and methods: Treatment protocol was approved by academic bioethical committee. From December 2005 to December 2011, the BCS was performed in 552 patients (63% of breast cancer surgery). BCS with IORT was performed in 184 patients (age 35-85 years; average 57 years), who signed informed consent. The diagnostic work-up was based on clinical and histo-pathological examination (BACC, oligobiopsy, VAB, excisional biopsy) and radiological tests (USG, MMG, MRI). Patients with primary tumour size < 3 cm, after exclusion of multifocality, were scheduled for BCS [wide local excision of the primary and sentinel lymph node biopsy(double dye-isotope technique)] with IORT. The IORT was performed with INTRABEAM PRS 500 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), emitting low energy X photons (<50 kV), which enables to irradiate the tumour bed with the (boost) dose of 20 Gy. Upon completion of adjuvant chemotherapy or immediately after initiation of postoperative hormonal therapy, external beam radiotherapy of the breast was performed (dose 50 Gy). Cosmetic effect was assessed objectively using a computer program, BCCT.core (University of Porto, Portugal), after analyzing digital photographs taken before and after surgery. The follow-up time ranged from 3 to 72 (median 44) months. Results: Early complications/toxicity included: seroma (3%), oedema (10%), redness (13%), delayed healing (15%). The most frequent late toxicity symptoms were: retraction (10%) and grade 2 fibrosis (23%); grade 3 fibrosis was detected only in 2% of patients. Reoperations (due to the final pathology findings) were carried out in 19 out of 184 (10%) patients: reexcision of involved margins in 14 (8%) patients, and mastectomy in 6 (3%). Local recurrence was observed in 3 (1,6%) patients, distant metastases in 4 patients (2%). Axillary lymph nodes were spared in 167 (91%) patients. Objective, computerised very good and good aesthetic effect was obtained in 160 (87%) patients. Three-year overall survival rate is 98.9%. Conclusions: BCS with low energy X photons IORT is simple, safe and effective treatment for patients with early breast cancer, characterized by a low recurrence rate and very good aesthetic outcome.",,0

Mastectomy is still a standard procedure and it was dominant way of breast cancer surgery in the end of the last century in Poland. Nowadays, the percentage of the breast conserving surgery is steadily increasing. The aim of this study was to analyze the preferences for the type of surgical treatment between rural and urban breast cancer patients taking into account clinical and pathological differences of the disease. Materials and methods: 1505 women with pathologically proven breast cancer, surgically treated during the last 10 years in a breast care unit were evaluated. The analysis concerned: place of living, type of surgical treatment including neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACTH) and intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), tumour size (T), lymph node status (N) and staging. Results: 958 (63.6%) urban and 547 (36.3%) rural, were surgically treated. Mastectomy was done to 50% urban and 55% rural patients. 49% urban and 45% rural women underwent breast conserving surgery (BCS). SNB allowed to preserve axillary lymph nodes in 79.2% of all group. (78.6% rural vs. 79.5 urban). The similar percentage of rural and urban pts. obtained NACTH or received IORT. No significant differences regarding application of NACTH before mastectomy or BCS. Tis (4%) and T1 (40%) tumours occurred more often in urban patients; T2 (49.1%) and T4 (9.5%) in rural (chi2; p=0.007). Stages 0 and I were more commonly diagnosed in urban patients (35.9% vs. 30.9%; chi2, p=0.039), stages II and III in rural (63.4% vs 58.1%). Conclusions: Although rural women were diagnosed significantly more frequent in higher stage of breast cancer, and thus more often decided to undergo mastectomy, the frequency of NACTH and IORT were similar. For rural women living far from the oncological centres, both NACTH and IORT seems to be feasible.",,0

Wide local excision of centrally located tumour is usually associated with removal of nipple-areola complex (NAC). However, it may cause major cosmetic defect of the breast. Irradiation of the tumour bed (boost) decreases the risk of local recurrence. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) facilitates direct delivery of the boost dose. Purpose of the study is analysis of early results of the BCS with NAC preservation and IORT boost in patients with centrally located early breast cancers. Material and Methods; Between January 2008 and December 2009, out of 227 women treated for breast carcinoma, BCS was performed in 164 (72%) patients. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) was done using isotope-dye technique. An attempt of BCS with NAC preservation and IORT was made whenever the tumour was < 2 cm, and located in the subareolar region. Samples from the base of the NAC and from the breast specimen in the vicinity of the tumour toward the NAC were examined intraoperatively in every case. The INTRABEAM PRS 500 system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, G) was used for intraoperative irradiation of the tumour bed with the dose of 20 Gy. Objective computerized aesthetic effect assessment based on the analysis of photographs taken before and after surgery, was done using the BCCT. core software (University of Porto, P). The protocol was approved by Ethical Committee. Results: Central location of the tumour was recognised in 16 (7%) patients. The BCS with NAC preservation and IORT was done in 13 patients (age ranged from 26 to 82 years). In one patient NAC was removed partially, two other patients underwent removal of central breast segment together with NAC due to intraoperatively detected positive margins. SNB was done in 15 cases, and axillary lymphadenectomy in 5. No surgical or postirradiation complications were observed. One patient developed a superficial skin areolar slough. Follow-up time ranged from 6 to 28 months. No local breast recurrence was detected. The BCCT. core general aesthetic score was very good, good and fair in 6, 8 and 2 patients, respectively. Conclusions: Integration of the intraoperative radiotherapy with low energy photons and breast conserving surgery enables preservation of nipple-areola complex with good cosmetic effect in patients with small centrally located breast carcinoma.

Intraoperative radiotherpy (IORT) facilitates delivery of a single dose of radiation directly to the tumour bed following wide local excision of the tumour. Purpose of the study is objective assessment of the cosmetic results of the BCS with IORT boost in patients with early breast cancers. Material and Methods; The treatment protocol was approved by Ethical Committee. Between May 2006 and December 2009, BCS was performed in 375 pts (63% of all pts treated surgically for breast carcinoma). Patients with primary tumour < 2cm were eligible for BCS and IORT after exclusion of multicentricity. The BCS and IORT was performed in 140 pts (age ranged from 36 to 80 years). Intrabeam PRS 500 system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, G) was used for irradiation of the tumour bed with the dose of 20 Gy at the applicator surface (boost). After completion of the adjuvant treatment, whole breast external beam irradiation was performed with a total dose of 50 Gy, omitting the tumour bed. Objective computerized aesthetic effect assessment based on the analysis of digital photographs taken before and after surgery (3 times: 12, 24, and 36 months), was done using BCCT. core software (University of Porto, PT). Follow-up time ranged from 15 to 47 months. Results: Out of the 140 BCS and IORT procedures, objective aesthetic effect was assessed in 95 pts. In this group no local breast recurrence was detected during follow up time. In pts who reached 3 years follow-up (n=23), the BCCT. core general aesthetic score was excellent in 48%, good in 39%, and fair in 13% of patients. No poor score was observed. In pts with 2 years follow-up (n=30) and in pts 1 year after surgery (n=42) aesthetic score was excellent in 50% and in 33%, good in 37% and in 40%, fair in 10% and in 24% of pts, respectively. Poor outcome was noticed in 1% in both groups. Although excellent or good aesthetic outcome improved from 74% after 1 year (n=31), to 87% after 2 or 3 years (n=46), the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.122; two-sided Fisher exact test). Fair or poor aesthetic outcome dropped down from 26% after 1 year (n=11) to 13% after 2 or 3 years (n=7).

Radium needle brachytherapy was successfully used to treat breast cancer more than 50 years prior to the widespread use of linear accelerators to treat the entire breast. Indeed, Geoffrey Keynes, British Surgeon and brother to the famous economist John Maynard Keynes, published his breast-preserving outcomes in 1938 in the British Medical Journal. His patients were treated with radium needles during the 1920s and 1930s. His remarkable conclusion was stated in this historically important manuscript: These results (with radium needle breast brachytherapy) compare favorably with the classic Halsted radical mastectomy."" In the US, modern breast brachytherapy began at the Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans, LA, in 1991. In our multidisciplinary clinic, a Venezuelan woman with T2N0M0 right breast cancer insisted upon a treatment option that ""can return me to work and my family in one week."" Drawing on our brachytherapy experience with soft tissue sarcoma after a compartmental resection, we delivered 45 Gy in 4 days with low dose-rate Iridium-192 to a target volume 2 cm beyond the surgical cavity edge. Pleased with the results in this original patient, we wrote a Phase II prospective clinical trial investigating 4-5 days wide-volume breast brachytherapy as an alternative to conventional 6-week whole breast irradiation in select breast cancers. This study accrured 162 patients and was initially reported in a matched-pair analysis. Two years later, William Beaumont Hospital in Michigan initiated a similar prospective Phase II clinical trial that has been widely published with similar long-term outcomes. In 1995, I designed and wrote RTOG 95-17, the first modern multi-institutional phase II clinical trial with interstitial bracytherapy PBI. This trial accrued briskly with excellent local control rates of 96% at 5 years and 95% at 7 years. Current investigators do not give any credence to the earlier Guy's Hospital Trial (Fentiman) or the Christie Hospital trial (Ribeiro) because of poor patient selection and absent quality control of bracytherapy/electron beam dosimetry or target volume coverage. Interstitial brachytherapy was considered by many to be too skilldependent and invasive. These concerns spawned the MammoSite balloon catheter in 2002. The simplicity of this single-channel singleentry brachytherapy device popularized PBI in the US. Other single entry devices, such as the multichannel SAVI and Contura catheters, soon came into practice across the US, allowing more refined doseshaping. The ability to pull the brachytherapy dose cloud away from the skin is considered a major improvement, and further increased PBI use in the US. It is currently estimated that up to 20% of eligible patients are receiving PBI in many areas of the US. The ultimate test of a new treatment or potential paradigm shift is considered to be the prospective randomized clinical trial. NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 has accrued 4050 out of a planned 4300 women as of January 2012. This study may close in January, 2013. There are currently 9 phase III clinical trials investigating PBI across the world, attesting to the significance of this concept to patients and oncologists alike. Single-dose intra-operative methods of delivering PBI, such as Intrabeam and intraoperative electrons, are also under investigation. In summary, a 21-year experience with PBI in the US has inspired a plethora of scientific endeavors. Lumpectomy, sentinel node mapping, and PBI may offer women with select breast cancers the highest quality of life and breast conservation.""",,0

Materials and Methods: Subjects enrolled in a study of partial-breast irradiation therapy after segmental mastectomy (intraoperative radiation therapy) plus a random sample of patients who underwent segmental mastectomies followed by conventional whole-breast radiation therapy were identified through the institution's breast cancer database from March 2003 through February 2006. A radiologist specializing in breast imaging reviewed and recorded each patient's pretreatment mammogram for breast density and tumor location and the first post-treatment mammogram, obtained within the first year of treatment, for three common types of mammographic change seen after breast surgery and radiation treatment (breast edema, skin thickening, and surgical scarring), which when severe make it difficult to use mammography for continuing follow-up of the conserved breast. The extent of mammographic change was noted by the radiologist as minimal, moderate, or marked. The data were entered into a database, and statistical analysis was conducted using logistic regression models and chi<sup>2</sup> tests. The effect of breast density on mammographic change was also assessed. Results: The severity of edema was lower with decreasing breast density (P < .006). There was no apparent effect of breast density on the severity of skin thickening. The extent of surgical scarring decreased as breast density increased (P < .026). Analysis of the data from the cumulative logistic regression models demonstrated that even after controlling for breast density, patients who underwent whole-breast radiation therapy had significantly more edema (P = .003), skin thickening (P = .003), and surgical scarring than those who underwent intraoperative radiation therapy (P < .001). Conclusion: Patients have a higher probability of having fewer post-treatment mammographic changes after partial-breast irradiation followed by segmental mastectomy than after breast conservation surgery followed by whole-breast irradiation. © 2009 AUR.",,0

Lagendijk,2006.0,A new robotic needle insertion method to minimise attendant prostate motion,10.1016/j.radonc.2006.06.013,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a new needle insertion method (tapping instead of pushing) in reducing attendant tissue motion. This can be useful in applications where tissue motion due to needle insertion is problematic such as e.g. MRI-guided prostate brachytherapy and breast biopsies. In this study we will focus on prostate motion due to needle insertion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prostate motion due to needle insertion was measured in 30 patients, who were transperineally implanted with fiducial gold markers for position verification in prostate intensity modulated radiotherapy. In total 32 needles were manually pushed into the prostate and 29 were tapped with a prototype robotic system. The prostate motion in the cranio-caudal direction was measured on the video record of the ultrasound images. Differences in prostate motion between the two needle insertion methods were analysed making use of SPSS. RESULTS: The mean prostate motion was 5.6mm (range 0.3-21.6) when the needle was pushed and 0.9 mm (range 0-2.0) when the needle was tapped into the prostate (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Prostate motion was significantly less when the needle was tapped into the prostate compared to when the needle was pushed. This result is important for the development of a tapping, MRI-guided, prostate implant robotic system.",eng,0

Lobera,1997.0,[Preventive analgesic effect of intraoperative administration of ibuprofen-arginine on postmastectomy pain syndrome],", ","The efficacy of preemptive analgesia on postoperative pain is discussed. From experimental neurophysiological data, the present policy of preventive analgesia aims at precluding modifications of the nervous system secondary to a nervous lesion and the appearance of chronic pain, particularly of the neurogenic kind. The post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) falls within the realm of neurogenic pain and is still poorly understood and underestimated. This study evaluated the preemptive effect of a perioperative administration of an oral non steroid anti-inflammatory, the ibuprofen-arginine, on PMPS. Thirty patients scheduled for partial or total mastectomy with axillary dissection were prospectively and randomly assigned to 2 groups. The ibuprofen-arginine group (group I) (n = 15), received an oral administration of 400 mg of ibuprofen-arginine, 90 min before surgery, 2 h after surgery and then every 8 h in the first 32 postoperative hours. The control group (group C) received in doubled blind a placebo at the same time. At 6 months, we looked after pain or dysesthesia. We confirmed the diagnosis of PMPS in presence of association of diagnosis criterias. Fourteen patients in each group have been included. Eighty-six percent of the patients (13 patients in group I and 11 patients in group C) presented at 6 months dysesthesia of the upper member ipsilateral to the mastectomy and/or the operated breast, appearing either immediately or after a laps of time. Nine patients (group I) and 6 patients (group C) had PMPS. Postoperative radiotherapy and lymphoedema were statistically associated with PMPS (p = 0.019 and p = 0.011). The perioperative preventive administration of a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug reduces neither the incidence of pain in the first post-operative months, nor the appearance of PMPS at 6 months. These results suggest that others factors than the nervous lesion may play a role in the occurrence of PMPS, as radiotherapy, lymphoedema, but also psychosocials factors.",fre,0

To address this issue, a multidisciplinary consensus conference was convened during the American Society of Breast Surgeons 2015 annual meeting. METHODS: The conference mission statement was to reduce the national reoperation rate in patients undergoing breast conserving surgery for cancer, without increasing mastectomy rates or adversely affecting cosmetic outcome, thereby improving value of care."" The goal was to develop a toolbox of recommendations to reduce the variability of reoperation rates and improve cosmetic outcomes. Conference participants included providers from multiple disciplines involved with breast cancer care, as well as a patient representative. Updated systematic reviews of the literature and invited presentations were sent to participants in advance. After topic presentations, voting occurred for choice of tools, level of evidence, and strength of recommendation. RESULTS: The following tools were recommended with varied levels of evidence and strength of recommendation: compliance with the SSO-ASTRO Margin Guideline; needle biopsy for diagnosis before surgical excision of breast cancer; full-field digital diagnostic mammography with ultrasound as needed; use of oncoplastic techniques; image-guided lesion localization; specimen imaging for nonpalpable cancers; use of specialized techniques for intraoperative management, including excisional cavity shave biopsies and intraoperative pathology assessment; formal pre- and postoperative planning strategies; and patient-reported outcome measurement. CONCLUSIONS: A practical approach to performance improvement was used by the American Society of Breast Surgeons to create a toolbox of options to reduce lumpectomy reoperations and improve cosmetic outcomes.""",eng,0

Given the photoelectric effect's dominance at the low photon energies in use, the dosimetry is dependent on the elemental composition of tissues. AAPM TG186 was mandated to investigate model-based dosimetry in brachytherapy to improve upon TG43. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been proposed as an alternative dose calculation algorithm for their abil ity to accurately transport low energy photons in realistic geometries. In MC dose calculations, tissue densities are extracted from CT data and accepted elemental compositions are either assigned to density intervals or organ contours. Such compositions are generally obtained from population averaged data sets and have uncertainties. The goal of this study is to assess the effects of such uncertainties on LOR MC dosimetry. Materials: The GEANT4 toolkit was used to simulate photon transport in spherical geometries of uniform medium. Dose from isotropic photon point sources was calculated to assess the effect of variations in tissue compositions and was scored both in medium and water. Photon spectra obtained from MC simulations of three low energy brachytherapy sources (<sup>125</sup>I Best model 2301, <sup>108</sup> Pd Best model 2553 and 50kV Xoft Axxent) were used as inputs. Compositions of a series of tissues were varied according to ranges provided by ICRU report 46. Breast tissue was approximated as a uniform mixture of adipose and glandular tissues. The adipose/glandular fraction was varied and for a given fraction, the effect of compositional uncertainties for each tissue was evaluated by varying each tissue's composition.MC dose calcu lations based on post implant CT patient geometries were performed lor four clinical permanent breast seed implants using the 103Pdsource. The effect of uncertainties on the composition of adipose and glandular tissues were assessed by comparing the PTV Vl00 metric for breast tissue for various adipose/glandular ratios. Results: To isolate compositional effects from densit effects, dose to water profiles on a density scaled distance axis from the <sup>103</sup>Pd source are shown in fig 1a for breast tissue. The inverse square law dependence has been factored out by multiplying dose values by r<sup>2</sup>. Fig 1b shows that going from water to 50/50 breast at 1 g/cm <sup>2</sup> yields a 20% dose difference. 70/30 breast with mean compositions results in an additional 4% deviation from water while the effect of compositional uncertainty on 70/30 is +/-8%. Patient calculations show (fig 1c) VI 00 variations of up to 14% from water. Variations due to adipose and glandular compositional uncertainty are larger than those obtained from varying the adipose/glandular ratio. (Graph presented). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that variations in the composition of human tissues introduce significant uncertainties in MC LOR brachytherapy dosimetry. Their amplitude is of second order compared to water/medium variations.",,0

Using low dose rate seeds and an electronic brachytherapy source (EBS), the authors quantify the large cavity theory conversion factors required. The authors also assess whether applying large cavity theory utilizing the sources' initial photon spectra and average photon energy induces errors related to spatial spectral variations. First, ideal spherical geometries were investigated, followed by clinical brachytherapy LDR seed implants for breast and prostate cancer patients. Methods: Two types of dose calculations are performed with the GEANT4 MC code. (1) For several human tissues, dose profiles are obtained in spherical geometries centered on four types of low energy brachytherapy sources: I 125, P 103 d, and C 131 s seeds, as well as an EBS operating at 50 kV. Ratios of Dw,m over Dm,m are evaluated in the 0-6 cm range. In addition to mean tissue composition, compositions corresponding to one standard deviation from the mean are also studied. (2) Four clinical breast (using P 103 d) and prostate (using I 125) brachytherapy seed implants are considered. MC dose calculations are performed based on postimplant CT scans using prostate and breast tissue compositions. PTV D90 values are compared for Dw,m and Dm,m. Results: (1) Differences (Dw,m / Dm,m -1) of -3% to 70% are observed for the investigated tissues. For a given tissue, Dw,m / Dm,m is similar for all sources within 4% and does not vary more than 2% with distance due to very moderate spectral shifts. Variations of tissue composition about the assumed mean composition influence the conversion factors up to 38%. (2) The ratio of D90 (w,m) over D90 (m,m) for clinical implants matches Dw,m / Dm,m at 1 cm from the single point sources. Conclusions: Given the small variation with distance, using conversion factors based on the emitted photon spectrum (or its mean energy) of a given source introduces minimal error. The large differences observed between scoring schemes underline the need for guidelines on choice of media for dose reporting. Providing such guidelines is beyond the scope of this work. © 2011 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",,0

Both APBI brachytherapy techniques were less costly than conventional WB with a B. In terms of direct medical costs, the technical component accounted for most, if not all, of the disparity among the various treatments. A general trend of decreasing RT costs was observed with further reductions in overall treatment time for WBRT techniques, but not all of the alternative treatment regimens led to similar total cost savings.

FT for the treatment of PCa has been called the ""male lumpectomy"", an analogue to women's breast lumpectomy for the treatment of breast cancer. Radical prostatectomy continues to be the most frequently performed treatment for localized PCa, as anatomic knowledge and several technical advances, i.e. the introduction of robotic assisted surgery, have led to successful oncological outcome and lower rates of post-treatment morbidity. However, a proportion of patients still experiences a no negligible sexual, urinary, and bowel morbidity. Although the rationale of active surveillance for low-risk PCa (PSA <10 ng/mL, Gleason grade 6 or less, and clinical stage T1c-T2a) is sound, only few of newly diagnosed patients elect this approach. Thus, in the recent years the concept of a ""subtotal therapy"" gained the interest of some urological schools.

Prostate, breast and gynecological cancers are the most common types of cancers. Since 2008, the number of brachytherapy facilities has decreased by 18%. In medicoeconomic terms, brachytherapy faces many problems: the coding system is outdated; brachytherapy treatments cost as much as internal radiation; fees do not cover costs; since iridium wire has disappeared from the market, the technique will be transferred to more expensive high-speed or pulse dose rates. The French financing grid based on the national study of costs lags behind changes in such treatments and in the best of cases, hospitals resorting to alternatives such as in-hospital brachytherapy are funded at 46% of their additional costs. Brachytherapy is a reference technique. With intense pressure on hospital pricing, financing brachytherapy facilities will become even more problematic as a consequence of the disappearance of iridium 192 wires.

APBI-EBRT techniques are characterized by a highly homogeneous dose distribution but also by a significant low-dose delivery to surrounding normal tissues. In order to reduce unnecessary dose to normal tissue, our group have proposed the use of mixed modulated photon and electron beams for the application of APBI treatments delivered by using the same photon multi-leaf collimator (xMLC). We present a clinical study for the implementation of this tecnique in order to be extended to other centers, since the necessary technology is already available in most radiotherapy services. Materials and Methods: The planning of this mixed technique was evaluated previously using a treatment planning system (TPS) based on full Monte Carlo simulations, called CARMEN, developed by our group. The xMLC already installed in the linac is used with a reduced SSD equal to 60 cm (figure c)) for electron beams in order to minimize electron scattering in the air between the linac and patient. Dosimetric limits for normal tissues were taken from the RTOG/NSAB 0413 protocol for APBI-EBRT. For the experimental verification, an ad-hoc breast phantom with semispherical geometry was designed. The phantom called NAOMI consists of 5mm-thick high-impact polystyrene slabs (figure a)) which can be placed one on top of each other to emulate breasts of different sizes (including chest-wall). NAOMI allows placing different types of ionization chambers (figure b)) and radiochromic film at different depths. For relative dosimetry, the QA consisted of the standard gamma analysis based on the distance to agreement (3mm)/dose difference (3%) criteria and a 95% passing rate, by applying a multi-plane verification using NAOMI with Gafchromic EBT3 film. Absolute dosimetry was measured at a representative point with a plane-parallel Roos chamber PTW 34001 for electron beams and ion chamber Wellhoffer CC04 for photon beams, accepting a 3% of deviation. Results: To date, seven APBI cases have been treated by using modulated electron and photon beams planned with CARMEN. The results showed an acceptable PTV coverage (90% of PTV was covered by 100% of the prescribed dose) with small volumes of lung and heart receiving low dose, which is especially important for the left-sided breast cases. The treatments were irradiated using no more time than usual in IMRT. There were no skin reactions of especial importance. The whole curse was delivered without complications. Conclusions: The implementation of mixed modulated electron and photon beams to treat partial breast is showing results comparable or even better than those achieved with other techniques. The use of the same xMLC already installed in many linacs lets to extend this approach to other institutions without a significant additional charge. (Figure Presented).",,0

In this study, the authors demonstrate the use of an intraoperative, near-infrared fluorescence imaging system for evaluation of perforator location and flap perfusion. METHODS: Indocyanine green was injected intravenously in six breast cancer patients undergoing a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Three dose levels of indocyanine green were assessed using the fluorescence-assisted resection and exploration (FLARE) imaging system. This system uses light-emitting diodes for fluorescence excitation, which is different from current commercially available systems. In this pilot study, the operating surgeons were blinded to the imaging results. RESULTS: Use of the FLARE system was successful in all six study subjects, with no complications or sequelae. Among the three dose levels, 4 mg per injection resulted in the highest observed contrast-to-background ratio, signal-to-background ratio, and signal-to-noise ratio. However, because of small sample size, the authors did not have sufficient power to detect statistical significance for these pairwise comparisons at the multiple-comparison adjusted type I error of 0.017. Six milligrams per injection provided a similar contrast-to-background ratio but also a higher residual background signal. CONCLUSION: Based on this pilot study, the authors conclude that near-infrared assessment of perforator flap breast reconstruction is feasible with a light-emitting diode-based system, and that a dose of 4 mg of indocyanine green per injection yields the best observed contrast-to-background ratio compared with a dose of 2 or 6 mg for assessment of flap perfusion.",eng,0

Although preoperative evaluation may provide valuable information, real-time intraoperative methods have the potential to provide the greatest benefit. Our laboratory has developed the Fluorescence-Assisted Resection and Exploration (FLARE) near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging system for intraoperative visualization of details of the underlying vasculature. The FLARE system uses indocyanine green, a safe and reliable NIR fluorophore already FDA-approved for other indications. The system has been optimized in large-animal models for the identification of perforator size, location, and perfusion and has also been translated to the clinic for use during breast reconstruction after mastectomy.

This has been due to the development of new, technologically advanced computer planning systems and treatment delivery techniques. Modern, three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities have been incorporated into treatment planning methods, allowing full 3D dose distributions to be computed. Treatment techniques involving online planning have emerged, allowing dose distributions to be calculated and updated in real time based on the actual clinical situation. In the case of early stage breast cancer treatment, for example, electronic brachytherapy treatment techniques are being used in which the radiation dose is delivered during the same procedure as the surgery. There have also been significant advances in treatment applicator design, which allow the use of modern 3D imaging techniques for planning, and manufacturers have begun to implement new dose calculation algorithms that will correct for applicator shielding and tissue inhomogeneities. This article aims to review the recent developments and best practice in brachytherapy techniques and treatments. It will look at how imaging developments have been incorporated into current brachytherapy treatment and how these developments have played an integral role in the modern brachytherapy era. The planning requirements for different treatments sites are reviewed as well as the future developments of brachytherapy in radiobiology and treatment planning dose calculation.

Bae,2012.0,Multiple margin positivity of frozen section is an independent risk factor for local recurrence in breast-conserving surgery,10.4048/jbc.2012.15.4.420,"PURPOSE: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiotherapy has become a standard treatment for early stage breast cancer, since the installation of NSABP B-06. One of the serious problems in BCS is that of local recurrence. There are many risk factors for local recurrence, such as large tumor size, multiple tumors, axillary lymph node involvement, young age, high nuclear grade, and so on. The aim of this study is to identify patients with a higher risk of local recurrence of breast cancer. METHODS: Between January 2002 and December 2006, 447 patients with breast cancer, and who had undergone BCS with immediate breast reconstruction, were enrolled in the study. The follow-up period was 5 years from the time of operation and we analyzed local recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). The analysis included various clinicopathological factors such as age, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, pathologic characteristics, and margin status. Statistical analysis was performed with log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier method. The p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 88 months and local recurrence of breast cancer occurred only in 16 cases (3.6%). The actual 5-year DFS, and OS rates were 90.6% and 93.3%, respectively. For the local recurrence of breast cancer, positive margin status, multiple margin positivity, conversed margin cases, T/N stages showed statistical significance in univariate analysis. However, only multiple margin positivity was identified as an independent risk factor for local recurrence in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: When the multiple margin positivity is diagnosed on intraoperative frozen biopsy, surgeons should consider a much wider excision of the breast and a more aggressive management.",eng,0

OBJECTIVE.: To investigate scatter radiation doses to specific organs of surgeons during intraoperative use of C-arm fluoroscopy in spine surgery and to provide practical intraoperative guidelines. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There have been studies that reported the radiation dose of C-arm fluoroscopy in various procedures. However, radiation doses to surgeons' specific organs during spine surgery have not been sufficiently examined, and the practical intraoperative radioprotective guidelines have not been suggested. METHODS: Scatter radiation dose (air kerma rate) was measured during the use of a C-arm on an anthropomorphic chest phantom on an operating table. Then, a whole body anthropomorphic phantom was located besides the chest phantom to simulate a surgeon, and scatter radiation doses to specific organs (eye, thyroid, breast, and gonads) and direct radiation dose to the surgeon's hand were measured using 4 C-arm configurations (standard, inverted, translateral, and tube translateral). The effects of rotating the surgeon's head away from the patient and of a thyroid shield were also evaluated. RESULTS: Scatter radiation doses decreased as distance from the patient increased during C-arm fluoroscopy use. The standard and translateral C-arm configurations caused lower scatter doses to sensitive organs than inverted and tube translateral configurations. Scatter doses were highest for breast and lowest for gonads. The use of a thyroid shield and rotating the surgeon's head away from the patient reduced scatter radiation dose to the surgeon's thyroid and eyes. The direct radiation dose was at least 20 times greater than scatter doses to sensitive organs. CONCLUSION: The following factors could reduce radiation exposure during intraoperative use of C-arm; (1) distance from the patient, (2) C-arm configuration, (3) radioprotective equipments, (4) rotating the surgeons' eyes away from the patient, and (5) avoiding direct exposure of surgeons' hands.",eng,0

The EBCTCG specifically found that the absolute reduction in the 5-year rate of LR was proportional to the absolute reduction in 15-year breast cancer mortality with a 4:1 ratio. Studies from the EBCTCG have also clearly shown that when RT for breast cancer inadvertently delivers 'excessive' dose to the heart, there is an increased rate of late cardiac deaths. Over time, LR rates with RT have decreased, particularly after BCS, and this is largely due to a favorable interaction of RT with adjuvant systemic therapy. There is new information emerging about the effectiveness of RT based on newer biologic classification of breast cancer and about how the 4:1 ratio might change in the face of increasingly effective systemic therapy and with a better understanding of the importance of biologic classification and of the competing risks of local and distant recurrence. Technical innovations in RT include the development of techniques that minimize cardiac irradiation. It is critical that CT simulation be done during which the heart should be contoured and the radiation dose-cardiac volume relationship be determined. In the EBCTCG's preliminary analysis, increased late cardiac deaths were most closely linked to mean cardiac doses >5 Gy. A number of techniques are available to minimize cardiac dose both after BCS and mastectomy and these will be described. There has also been development of fractionation and treatment techniques to complete RT faster for purposes of patient convenience and to assure its optimal level of use. There are now 10-year results from a Canadian trial showing equivalent LR and cosmetic outcome with RT using the convential 25 treatments to the whole breast compared to 16 treatments using a higher dose per day. Few randomized patients, however, were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and a boost was not used. The generalizability of the Canadian trial results to patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or requiring a boost is not known. For patients treated after BCS, there has been great interest in the use of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), which can be accomplished using interstitial, intracavitary, external-beam or intraoperative techniques. Clinical trials are now underway to compare APBI to conventional techniques, but mature results from these trials will not be available for some time. In the U.S., ASTRO has developed a consensus statement based on an expert panel as to when APBI can be reasonably used outside of a clinical trial and this will be described. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the long duration of conventional WBI regimens negatively impacts on quality of life. This has led investigators to evaluate an alternative approach of delivering radiation to a limited volume of tissue around the tumour cavity only (partial breast irradiation) and delivering a larger than standard dose of radiation with each treatment (accelerated partial breast irradiation, APBI). This approach may be achieved by a number of techniques: interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy using the Mammosite device, intraoperative techniques using electrons or low-energy photons, external beam radiotherapy or permanent seed implant. This articles will review the rationale for the less that whole breast radiotherapy approach and describe the techniques by which it can be achieved and the results obtained to date.

The low crude numbers of recurrence in elderly patients led us to investigate the feasibility and the efficacy of this procedure as a sole treatment. Methods and Materials: We included 94 patients older than 65 years in this phase II trial. Among them, 42 patients presented with all the inclusion criteria, i.e., stages pT0 to pT1 and pN0, ductal invasive unifocal carcinoma, and tumor-free margin of >2 mm. IORT was delivered using a dedicated linear accelerator. One 21-Gy fraction was prescribed and specified at the 90% isodose, using electrons. In vivo dosimetry was performed for all patients. The primary endpoint was the quality index. Secondary endpoints were quality of life, local recurrences, cosmetic results, and specific and overall rates of survival. Results: The median follow-up was 30 months (range, 12-49 months), and median age was 72 years (range, 66-80 years). The median tumor diameter was 10 mm.

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) could be an alternative to overcome these. Methods and Materials: We evaluated 50 women with early breast cancer operated on in a dedicated IORT facility. Median dose of 10 Gy was delivered using 9-MeV electron beams. All patients received postoperative EBRT (50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions). Late toxicity and cosmetic results were assessed independently by two physicians according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event v3.0 grading system and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires.

In the elderly, the low crude numbers of recurrence and the frequency of comorbidities urged teams to investigate the feasibility and the results of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) delivered in one fraction during the surgical procedure. Material and methods: 94 patients (> 65 years old) accepted to be included in this phase II trial according to clinical and histopathology criteria and signed the informed consent. Among them, 42 presented all the inclusion criteria, namely pT0-1 pN0, non lobular invasive unifocal carcinoma, margin 2 mm (assessed during the surgical procedure) and estrogen receptors positivity. All patients were operated upon in a dedicated IORT facility (linear accelerator) located centrally among six operated rooms. After tumor removal, the surgical bed was approximated by sutures to bring the tissue within the radiation target volume. The tumor beds were completely encompassed by 4 to 6 cm circular fields using flattened applicators at a 110 cm distance. One fraction of 21 Gy was prescribed and specified at the 90% isodose using electron with energies ranging from 6 to 10 MeV. In vivo dosimetry was performed for all patients using real-time in vivo semiconductor detectors (PTW) fixed by the surgeon within the surgical bed. A 5 year adjuvant hormonotherapy was prescribed according to the recommendations. Primary end-point was the quality index [QI] - ratio between the prescribed dose and the in vivo measured dose-. Secondary endpoints corresponded to quality of life, local recurrences, cosmetic results, specific and overall survival. Results: Median follow-up is now 54 months [range 12-62]. Median age was 72 years [66-80] and median tumor diameter was 10 mm [3-19 mm]. 36 tumors were grade 1 or 2 and 100 % of the tumors expresses estrogen receptors. All patients received the total prescribed dose. No external postoperative radiotherapy was delivered. Intraoperative dosimetry demonstrated a good accordance between the delivered and the prescribed doses for 97% of the 37 evaluable patients. No acute grade 2 or greater toxicities were observed. Scores for quality of life were collected for all patients and showed no modification between pre and posttreatment evaluations. Late cosmetic result was good to excellent. All patients are still alive and the 4 year-disease-free-survival is currently 97%. Two patients recurred: (i) one infracentimetric superficial recurrence in the border of the surgical bed and close to the skin (at 18 months) (ii) a second primary tumor in another quadrant (at 6 months). These two patients underwent salvage mastectomy and are free of disease at the time of analysis. Conclusion: For a very selected population, these results confirm that partial breast IORT with electrons may be considered as an interesting alternative to the standard 6-weeks radiotherapy, offering therefore a safe one-step procedure treatment.",,0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with early stage breast cancer treated with WBI and NIBB boost were identified. Control subjects treated with EB boost identified as the best possible match with respect to age, stage, chemotherapy use, and fractionation were chosen for a 2:1 comparison. Acute toxicity, late toxicity, and oncologic outcomes were reviewed. The McNemar nonparametric test was used to evaluate marginal homogeneity between matched pairs. RESULTS: One hundred forty-one patients were included in the analysis: 47 patients treated with NIBB boost and 94 matched control subjects treated with EB boost (electron, n = 93) or 3-D conformal radiation (n = 1). Grade 2+ desquamation developed in 18 patients (39%) treated with NIBB boost and in 49 patients (52%) treated with EB boost (P = .07). Breast size, electron energy, and fractionation predicted for acute desquamation (P < .0001, P < .001, and P = .006). Median follow-up was 13.6 months. One patient (2%) who received NIBB had Grade 2+ skin/subcutaneous fibrosis 15 months after completion of treatment. Among those treated with EB, 9 patients (9.5%) developed Grade 2+ subcutaneous fibrosis, and 1 patient had recurrent cellulitis. There was statistically significantly less combined skin/subcutaneous toxicity in those treated with NIBB than in those treated with EB (P = .046).

Hepel,2015.0,Prescription dose evaluation for APBI with noninvasive image-guided breast brachytherapy using equivalent uniform dose,10.1016/j.brachy.2015.03.007,"PURPOSE: Noninvasive image-guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB) is an attractive novel approach to deliver accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Calculations of equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were performed to identify the appropriate APBI dose for this technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: APBI plans were developed for 15 patients: five with three-dimensional conformal APBI (3D-CRT), five with multi-lumen intracavitary balloons (m-IBB), and five simulating NIBB treatment. Prescription doses of 34.0 and 38.5 Gy were delivered in 10 fractions for m-IBB and 3D-CRT, respectively. Prescription doses ranging from 34.0 to 38.5 Gy were considered for NIBB. Dose-volume histogram data from all 3D-CRT, m-IBB, and NIBB plans were used to calculate the biologically effective EUD and corresponding EUD to the PTV_eval using the following equation: EUD = EUBED/(n [1 + EUD/alpha/beta]). An alpha/beta value of 4.6 Gy was assumed for breast tumor. EUD for varying NIBB prescription doses were compared with EUD values for the other APBI techniques. RESULTS: Mean PTV_eval volume was largest for 3D-CRT (372.9 cm(3)) and was similar for NIBB and m-IBB (88.7 and 87.2 cm(3), respectively). The EUD value obtained by prescribing 38.5 Gy with 3D-CRT APBI was 38.6 Gy. The EUD value of 34.0 Gy prescribed with m-IBB was 34.4 Gy. EUD values for NIBB ranged from 33.9 to 38.2 Gy for prescription doses ranging from 34.0 to 38.5 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Using EUD calculations to compare APBI techniques and treatment doses, a prescription dose of 36.0 Gy in 10 fractions using NIBB has a comparable biologic equivalent dose to other established brachytherapy techniques.",eng,0

Based on the radionale that most disease recurrences are observed in the quadrant of the primary tumour, many studies have been conducted and others are still ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of a partial irradiation of the mammary gland with the use of interstitial brachytherapy or external beams of electrons or photons, also with sophisticated techniques (conformational 3-D radiotherapy or IMRT). At the European Institute of Oncology (EIO), it has been decided to use intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), and a mobile, miniaturized accelerator, delivering electron beams directly on the residual mammary gland during surgery, has been set up in an operating room. The experience of the EIO has been drawn from a phase I study (dose escalation) and a phase II study (to evaluate acute and middle-term toxicity); finally a phase III study has been started, and is still ongoing, to compare the efficacy of partial irradiation by IORT with respect to conventional radiotherapy on the whole breast. The toxicity so far detected is absolutely acceptable, but is necessary to wait for the end of the study in order to have the preliminary data, and for an adequate period of follow-up in order to evaluate the results.",,0

Patients with ILC are categorized in the cautionary group according to ASTRO guidelines. We looked into the population treated with intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (ELIOT) as full dose to investigate the impact of lobular compared to ductal histology (IDC) in terms of local recurrence. Matherials and methods: From 1999 to 2007, 2220 patients were treated with breast conserving surgery and intraoperatory radiotherapy with electrons (21 Gy at 90% isodose) as sole treatment. The study population includes both patients treated outside and inside the clinical randomized phase III trial ELIOT. Out of 2220 patients, 255 (11.5%) presented ILC. We compared this group with patients having IDC, treated in the same period. The rate of local recurrences has been analyzed, with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. The role of patients and tumor features on local control has been evaluated. Results: Compared to IDC group, patients with ILC were older (> 70, 20% vs. 11%), with no lymph node involvement(pN0, 79% vs. 70%), low grading(G1-2,86% vs.72%), absence of vascular invasion(81% vs. 98%), higher hormonal receptor status (ER +, 97% vs. 88%), HER2 negativity (96% vs. 89%), low proliferative index(Ki-67, 23% vs. 44%). No differences were noticed with regard to the technical parameters of ELIOT. On the whole, the incidence of local relapse was 4.5% at 5 years (0.9/100 per year). Within the first 5 years of follow-up, no differences were observed between lobular and ductal histology, but after 5 years the difference became significant (p 0.05). Higher risk of local relapse was also observed in old patients (over 60) with ILC. Regarding the biomolecular classification, lobular carcinomas belonging to Luminal A subtype had a more aggressive local behavior than Luminal A ductal carcinomas, showing a significantly higher rate of local relapse (p 0.0021). Conclusion: In spite of a favorable tumor profile, a greater incidence of local relapse occurred in tumors with ILC compared to ductal histology. When considering the anagraphic, histological and biomolecular variables, the old age (>60), the proliferative index and the luminal A subtype turned out to be significant. Interestingly, the incidence of local relapse becomes statistically significant 5 years after the treatment. This event points out the importance of an adequate follow-up length, especially in lobular histology for which other reports on whole breast irradiation in literature describe similar biological behavior .",,0

Materials and Methods: Between June 2004 and December 2008, 357 premenopausal women with a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer were given breast conservative surgery (quadrantectomy and sentinel node biopsy +\- axillary dissection). During surgery, an electron intraoperative boost of 12 Gy was administered to the tumour bed. Within 4 weeks after having received the IORT boost, the whole breast was irradiated with hypofractionated scheme. HEBRT consisted of 13 daily fractions of 2.85 Gy up to a total dose of 37.05 Gy, with 3-D conformal technique. Median age was 42 years (24-48). Pathologic stages were distributed as follow: stage 0 4 (1.1%), I 192(53.8%), stage IIA 108 (30.3%), stage IIB 28 (7.8%), stage IIIA 18 (5%), stage IIIC 6 (1.7%), CR 1(0.3 %). The biomolecular classification included 33 triple negative patients. All patients but one received adjuvant systemic treatment, according to tumor features. Chemotherapy +/- endocrinotherapy was offered to 149 patients, while endocrinotherapy alone was given to 197 patients. In all cases, adjuvant chemotherapy commenced after the completion of HEBRT. Follow-up was carried out on a regular basis by breast surgeons and radiation oncologists. Results: Median follow-up was 83.1 months (range 9.1-118.9). 340 patients were alive and 317 were free of any disease (89%). Three patients (0.8%) had nodal regional recurrence, 12 patients (3.4%) had local recurrence, 26 patients (7.3%) had distant metastasis.13 patients (3.6%) developed contralateral breast cancer.12 patients (3.4%) had a new primary tumor in other site. 15 patients (4.2%) died due to progression of disease, while two died of other causes not related to the breast cancer. Conclusions: This shortened scheme including intraoperative anticipated boost and hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy showed a good local control at 5 years follow-up. The patients' compliance is very high and in patients who are in need of chemotherapy, the time gap between surgery and radiotherapy treatment is avoided. As follow-up length increases, a greater number of patients will achieve the minimum 5 -year period to receive the first long-term evaluation and the strength of the results on efficacy is bound to increase.",,0

IORT as a boost followed by conventional external radiotherapy has less radiation-induced fibrosis than whole breast radiotherapy, but the percentage of higher-grade fibrosis (II -III ) still ranges between 25 - 38% after IORT as a boost. Currently, it is not possible to plan the radiation therapy process beforehand for IORT. Radiance planning System is a new simulation and planning tool for IORT. The purpose of this project is to validate the planning software Radiance System for IORT boost patients by creating dose-volume-histograms for the skin at risk and to find the affecting factors for fibrosis after IORT as a boost. Methods: 42 cases were enrolled into replanning and analysis and distributed into two groups: 14 cases with fibrosis in group A and 28 cases without fibrosis in group B. The replanning data including breast volume, seroma volume, skin volume, skin dose, applicator size and 50% dose-volume were planned successfully using Radiance System. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done for the patients' basic characteristic, radiotherapy data and replanning data. Results: In the univariate analysis, seroma volume and skin volume were associated with a trend towards the risk of fibrosis (p < 0.1), whereas applicator size and 50% dose-volume were significantly associated with higher grade fibrosis (p < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, the independent prognostic factor for fibrosis was the applicator size (p = 0.0565, OR 3.85, 95%CI 0.963 - 15.384). Conclusions: An increase of the applicator size of 1cm increased the risk of fibrosis 3.85 times after IORT as a boost in breast cancer. The results suggest that excessive expansion of the clear margin during breast conserving surgery will obviously increase the risk for fibrosis after IORT. Secondly, the planning software Radiance system was validated and can be used as an evaluation and documentation tool for post-planning of IORT for breast cancer.",,0

Materials and Methods: The international TARGIT-A trial for breast cancer showed favorable local control as a single-dose accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). In the US, a multi-center clinical trial was initiated to investigate the efficacy of IORT using a new form of electronic brachytherapy system, the Xoft Axxent System and its balloon applicators, which has been recently commissioned in our clinic. Experience with the balloon applicator has since been built up with MammoSite-like, five-day, BID APBI treatments. However, to implement IORT smoothly and successfully, a thorough review and reinforcement of our quality management program and relevant staff training had to be performed. To achieve this goal, we have addressed the following issues as part of our quality management program: (1) Machine quality assurance (QA) and emergency procedures. To guarantee the readiness of the Xoft unit for IORT and prepare for the possible emergency situations, the available routine (daily, quarterly and annual) QA and emergency procedures have been modified to suit the operating room (OR) environment. (2) IORT pre-plans. A library of plans has been built before IORT with the Nucletron Plato BPS for the scanned CT images of full range of balloon applicators in a water phantom. Independent physics check of these plans was performed as a standard practice. (3) Staff training. The nature of IORT demands not only the staff from the radiation oncology department be fluent in operating the Xoft unit, but also all personnel involved in the OR understand this novel technology. Therefore, besides the necessary training for qualified users of the Xoft unit in the Radiation Oncology department, our physician also provided inservice for the OR staff in form of PowerPoint presentations and welldesigned quizzes. (4) Transportation, warranty and insurance. The essential logistics of transporting the Xoft unit between different sites was carefully arranged to cover any potential accidental damages. It depends on the hospital policy whether additional warranty is needed. (5) State registration and radiation shielding for the OR. The Xoft had to be registered as a Transportable instead of a Mobile device in order to transport between different sites in compliance with the State's regulations. The ORs in the hospital are generally not shielded for radiation. A shielding plan for various potential ORs was submitted with the projected IORT patient load and approved by the State before IORT. Personnel in the OR during beam-on time must wear radiation badges. Various proper mobile shieldings are provided as needed. (6) Dry run. To find out possible failures during the whole process of IORT, two end-toend dry runs were performed in the OR one week before the first IORT case with all parties involved. This was found to be a necessary step toward the final goal. Results: IORT was able to be incorporated as part of our clinical practice smoothly and successfully. Conclusions: With the availability of a novel Xoft Axxent electronic brachytherapy system in our clinic, through a thorough and rigorous quality management program dedicated to address potential issues in every aspect of implementing IORT, we were able to coordinate with all parties involved to expand our clinical practice by implementing the IORT for early stage breast cancer.",,0

Post-operative high dose rate (HDR) Ir-192 brachytherapy partial breast irradiation (PBI) has been widely performed using multiple commercially available applicators. To test the feasibility of developing an HDR-based breast IORT program we retrospectively compared the dosimetry of Contura Ir-192 HDR and Xoft 50kV IORT treatment plans. Materials/Methods: Five patients treated with Contura-based PBI had plans generated using the PTVand prescription dose of the TARGIT-A protocol-i.e.-20 Gy to a depth of 2 mm from the applicator. In these cases, the contour of the Contura balloon was expanded by 2 mm to create a 2 mm thick PTV. The PTV-eval is defined as a 1 cm expansion of the balloon, except for skin. The Xoft 50 kV x-ray source was also modeled in the BrachyVision treatment planning system, and the same plans were calculated assuming that the Xoft applicator coincided with the central lumen of the Contura balloon, with the same volumetric optimization parameters. The Dose-Volume parameters DXX refers to the dose D that the percent PTV Volume XX receives. The conformality is defined as (D95/D10)100. Results: A comparison of dosimetric parameters for each treatment type is shown in Table 1. For the Contura, the D99 and D95 averages 89.3%, and 93.0% of the prescribed dose, while it is only 72.9% and 86.6% (p=0.002, andp=0.002) of the prescription with the Xoft applicator. Likewise, the average conformality index is greater for the Contura plans 80.9 versus 71.4 (p=0.003) for Xoft, indicating a more homogeneous dose distribution within the PTV for Contura-based HDR treatment. Comparison of the average PTV-eval D95 for the two different applicators, also favored the Contura (p<0.001). Conclusions: This retrospective study shows the dosimetric feasibility of Contura-based HDR IORT. The multi-lumen capabilities show superior dosimetric results as compared to a stepping 50 kV x-ray source, and the multiple dwell positions within the Contura applicator are inherently superior to a single dwell position in the center of a balloon applicator.

However, there are technical drawbacks to IORT methods, such as the lack of image-based planning and the low dose delivered (5-7 Gy at 1 cm from the applicator surface). Use of high-doserate Ir-192 should show an increase in the dose at 1cm due to the higher energy of the photons used. However, this requires a shielded procedure room, which is not available at most institutions. The Image-Guided Brachytherapy Suite at the University of Virginia is such a room, which includes a sliding gantry CT scanner, an OR-type treatment couch, along with full anesthesia capabilities. Thus, all the ingredients are in place for Materials and Methods: The CT scans of 15 patients who had previously received Contura-based breast brachytherapy were used for this study (8 right breast and 7 left breast). All planning was performed on the Varian BrachyVision v. 11 treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The treatments were optimized to delivered 10 Gy to the PTVeval as described in the literature, with a D95 of 95% and a D150 of 28% used as the optimization parameters. Additionally, a constraining structure 3 mm around the PTVeval was used as a further optimization to attempt to keep dose within the PTVeval. Structures named PTV-3mm and PTV-1mm were also created by expanding the balloon three and one mm, respectively, and subtracting the balloon volume from the contour Because the dose at the surface of a structure cannot be determined directly in the treatment planning system, the PTV-1mm was used for surrogate for surface dose for comparison to published literature for 50 kV IORT. Additional structures that were contoured included the whole heart for left-sided breast patients and the ribs for all patients. Additionally, the TG-43 data for a 50 kV treatment device was loaded into the treatment planning system so that comparisons could be made between Ir-192 based brachytherapy and 50 kV electronic brachytherapy. The same volume optimization parameters were used for the 50 kV plans as for the Ir-192 plans. Results: The dosimetric results of this study are shown in Table 1. All of the dosimetric parameters showed an advantage for use of a multilumen applicator except for the heart and rib dosimetric parameters, which can be explained by the higher energy of Ir-192 treatments. However, these doses are well within tolerance. The use of volumetric optimization improved the dosimetric results for the multilumen treatment due to the increased degrees of freedom for the optimization afforded by the multiple catheters. Conclusions: IORT may be delivered using a variety of techniques. This study shows that the use of a multilumen catheter with HDR can improve most dosimetric results when compared to a 50 kV source in a single lumen applicator. However, attention must be given to mean heart and maximum rib doses for HDR-based IORT. (Table Presented).",,0

Selection criteria for IORT includes tumour size <3 cm, estrogen receptor (ER) positive, N0 disease, margins >2 mm, absence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and extensive in situ component (EIC). Patients found to have nodal disease on sentinel lymph node biopsy, inadequate margins or presence of LVI and EIC on histology will be offered WBRT. Patients who had IORT at least 18 months ago were interviewed with regards to their cosmetic outcomes and quality of life (QOL). Results: During this period, 48 patients were offered IORT. Forty-six (96%) were >50 years old, 42 (87%) had tumour size <2 cm, 40 (84%) had grade 1 or 2 tumours, 45 (94%) had pN0 disease, 42 (87%) and 43 (90%) tumours were negative for LVI and EIC respectively. IORT was delivered in 44 (92%) cases. It was aborted in 4 (8%) cases due to inadequate flap thickness (n = 2, 4%) and excessive cavity size postwide excision (n = 2, 4%). The majority of patients (n = 24, 55%) were of small breast size, breast cup B and below. However, all except 1 patient could accommodate a large size applicator (size 4-5). Nine (20%) cases required further surgery due to involved or close margins. Of these, 7 (16%) patients had wider excision while 2 (4%) patients underwent completion mastectomy. WBRT was recommended after IORT in 13 (30%) cases due to inadequate margins, positive nodal disease and presence of LVI or EIC. There were no clinically significant complications, including hematoma or abscess requiring open drainage, seroma requiring aspiration more than 3 times or grade 3-4 radiation toxicity. At a median follow up of 20 (range 2-33) months, there was no ipsilateral breast or systemic recurrence. However, there was 1 (2%) ipsilateral axillary nodal recurrence which occurred at 8 months post-surgery in a patient with T1cN0M0 disease who declined adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Majority of the patients scored their mid-term cosmetic outcome and QOL as excellent (70% and 79% respectively). Conclusions: IORT can be successfully delivered to Asian women despite their relatively small breast size, with excellent mid-term disease control. The surgical complications and radiation toxicities were mild. Most patients reported good cosmetic outcome and QOL.",,0

While IORT has been widely used in Western countries, there has been limited experience with Asian patients. Here, we describe our initial experience with IORT at a single Asian institution. Material and Methods: All breast cancer patients who have been selected for INTRABEAM IORT at the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) from June 2012 to September 2013 were included in the study. The clinical features, surgical details, pathological findings, and follow up data are collected in a retrospective fashion and analysed. Results: 34 cases were selected for IORT in our institution in this period. 31 patients (91%) were Chinese, with age ranging from 45 to 70 years (median 59 years). 24 (71%) of the cancers were screen detected. Tumour size ranged between 5-25mm (median 12 mm). 31 (91%) cases were T1c or smaller. 28 (82%) of the cases were grade 1 or2 tumours. All cases were ER positive, while 32 (94%) were PR positive. All except 2 (94%) of the cases were cerb2 negative. 3 (9%) cases were positive for lymphovascular invasion while 1 (3%) case had extensive in situ component. The majority of patients (n = 22, 73%) were of small breast size, breast cups B and below. The median breast size was 80 B. All except 1 patient could accommodate a large size applicator (4-5 cm). IORT was aborted in 2 (7%) cases due to inadequate flap thickness, 1 (3%) case for excessive cavity size post-wide excision and 1 (3%) case where the patient had nodal disease and did not agree preoperatively to IORT as boost. Four cases required further surgery due to involved or close margins with DCIS. Of these, 3 (10%) cases had wider excision followed by WBRT while 1 (3%) patient underwent a completion mastectomy. 6 (20%) patients underwent WBRT after IORT due to involved or close margins, positive nodal disease, presence of lymphovascular invasion or extensive in-situ component. Reported post-treatment complications include 4 cases (13%) of cellulitis managed successfully with oral antibiotics, 2 cases (7%) of skin erythema with spontaneous resolution, 3 cases (10%) of bruising, and 1 case (3%) of hematoma and fibrosis each. All patients' wounds healed well with good cosmetic outcome. The longest follow up till date is 18 months with a median of 6 months. There is no ipsilateral breast or systemic recurrence to date. There is 1 (3%) ipsilateral axillary nodal recurrence which occurred at 8 months post-surgery in a patient who had T1cN0M0 disease who declined adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Conclusion: This study represents the 1st report of the use of INTRABEAM IORT in an Asian population. IORT was successfully delivered in the majority of our patients despite relatively small breast volumes compared to their western counterpart. Post-treatment complications were infrequent and mild, with good cosmetic outcomes.",,0

These include accelerated partial breast irradiation, intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Follow-up data of multicatheter brachytherapy accelerated partial breast irradiation and intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy confirm excellent 5-year local control rates in well selected patients. Early side effects seem to be improved, but recent data show increasing skin toxicity in multicatheter and intracavitary balloon brachytherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy, proton beam partial breast irradiation, intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy improve dose homogeneity and decrease normal tissue complication probability. For breast-only treatment, two tangential fields with different segments provide an attractive and feasible alternative to the conventional technique. The proposed intensity modulated radiotherapy techniques for comprehensive locoregional radiotherapy, however, result in increased doses to the contralateral lung and breast. SUMMARY: Input from long-term clinical data on new radiotherapy techniques is needed. Consensus on target volume contouring and dose volume constraints for nontarget tissue has not yet been reached. Further research on skin toxicity with multicatheter or intracavitary brachytherapy is needed to improve the results. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,0

Serletti",2016.0,Assessing Surgical and Medical Complications in Bilateral Abdomen-Based Free Flap Breast Reconstructions Compared With Unilateral Free Flap Breast Reconstructions,10.1097/sap.0000000000000343,"BACKGROUND: Prophylactic mastectomy is more common, with many patients seeking reconstruction. Bilateral free flap reconstructions subject patients to 2 flaps and longer operations, potentially increasing their risk for complications. We hypothesized that bilateral abdomen-based free flap reconstruction patients are a unique patient population with a higher rate of perioperative complications. METHODS: A retrospective chart review compared all 444 bilateral abdomen-based free flap breast reconstructions (in 222 patients) and 367 unilateral free flap breast reconstructions, performed at a single institution between March 2005 and July 2011. Patient and surgical characteristics and complications were studied. RESULTS: Bilateral reconstruction patients were slightly younger and heavier (mean, 49.2 years and 77.7 kg) and more likely to be white. Bilateral reconstructions were more often immediate reconstructions and less likely to have postoperative radiation therapy. These patients had longer surgical times and higher rates of intraoperative arterial thrombosis, but there were no significant differences in postoperative thrombosis or flap loss rates between the groups. The bilateral reconstruction patients, however, did have higher rates of minor surgical and medical complications, including a higher rate of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (1.8% vs 0.3%, P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: We find that bilateral abdomen-based free flap breast reconstruction patients do not have higher rates of major postsurgical complications such as flap loss or postoperative thrombosis. However, higher rates of minor surgical and postoperative medical complications, including significantly more cases of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, are seen. These findings are important for patient counseling and perioperative management.",eng,0

The authors' aim was to determine whether acellular dermal matrix use in immediate prosthesis-based breast reconstruction is associated with higher rate of complications. METHODS: Over a 5(1/2)-year period at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, 470 postmastectomy defects were reconstructed immediately using tissue expanders or implants. These were divided into two groups: reconstructions with or without acellular dermal matrix. Data were collected on patient comorbidities, radiation, intraoperative tumescent solution use, prosthesis size, initial fill volume, and complications. RESULTS: The risk for major infections that required prosthesis removal was elevated in the acellular dermal matrix group (4.9 versus 2.5 percent), but this increase did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.172). There was a statistically significant increase in overall wound infection rate in the acellular dermal matrix group (6.8 versus 2.5 percent, p = 0.031), but in a multivariate analysis, the use of acellular dermal matrix did not materialize as a significant risk factor for overall wound infection. Overall surgical complication rate was significantly higher in the acellular dermal matrix group at 19.5 percent, compared with the non-acellular dermal matrix group at 12.3 percent (p < 0.001). Other significant risk factors for overall surgical complication included smoking, higher body mass index, higher initial volume, and larger implant size. CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection for prosthesis reconstruction involving acellular dermal matrix should be judicious, especially among smokers and patients with elevated body mass index. Even though the use of acellular dermal matrix allows higher initial volumes and reduced number of expansions, one should be careful about putting in too high of an initial volume.",eng,0

Methods: Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were performed to detect the protein and mRNA expressions of Livin and FHIT in 30 cases of breast cancer tissues and adjacent tissues 1 cm, 2 cm and 3 cm distant from the margin of tumor bodies. The expressions of Livin and FHIT proteins were compared with the HE staining results. Results: The positive rates of Livin protein were 66.67%, 20.83%, 2.50% and 0.00% in breast cancer and adjacent tissues 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm distant from tumor bodies, respectively. The positive rates of Livin mRNA were 73.30%, 19.17%, 3.33%, and 0.00%, respectively. The positive rates were 46.67%, 76.67%, 82.50%, and 86.67% for FHIT protein and 53.33%, 73.33%, 85.00% and 87.50% for FHIT mRNA. The expressions of Livin mRNA and FHIT mRNA had negative correlation (r = -0.346, P < 0.01). The differences in livin and FHIT expressions were statistically significant between different locations (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The expressions of Livin and FHIT were significantly different in breast cancer and para-cancerous tissues with varying distance to the tumor margins.

This report reviews oncologic and cosmetic outcomes for Chinese Han breast cancer patients who received IORT either as a boost or as their sole radiation treatment at our hospital. Method: From July 2008 to December 2012, 50 early-stage Chinese Han breast cancer patients received BCS and IORT, either as boost or as their sole radiation treatment. Patients received adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, according to our institution's guidelines. Patients were followed to determine oncologic events, short-term toxicity and overall cosmesis. Results: With a median follow-up of 51.8 months (range 22.6 months to 75.7 months), 2 patients (4.0%) developed local relapses and were salvaged by mastectomy. There were no metastases and no deaths. The average wound healing time was 17 days. Three patients (6.0%) developed postoperative infection, 5 patients (10.0%) had delayed wound healing, and 2 patients (4.0%) experienced wound edema. There were no lyponecrosis or hematomas observed. The evaluation of cosmetic outcome showed 44 patients (88.0%) graded as excellent or good while 6 patients (12.0%) were graded as fair or poor. No patients experienced radiotherapy related acute hematological toxicity, but 3 patients (6.0%), all IORT boost patients, developed skin pigmentation. Conclusion: For early-stage breast cancer patients, intraoperative radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery in the Chinese Han population is both safe and reliable and has resulted in very acceptable cosmetic outcomes.",,1

Herskind,2011.0,Sublethal damage (SLD) repair: Relation to DNA repair and implications for protracted irradiation with low-energy x-rays,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed13&AN=70649854","Purpose/Objective(s): Repair of sublethal damage (SLD) during protracted dose delivery may potentially influence the biological effect of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with low-energy x rays. The purpose was to determine experimental halftimes of SLD repair for cell inactivation in vitro and compare it with repair of DNA damage in the same dose range. Materials/Methods: SLD repair was detected by split-dose recovery for colony formation of Chinese hamster V79 and human breast tumor MCF7 cell lines, and for human normal skin fibroblasts (passage 6-8). Repair halftimes were derived for the linearquadratic (L-Q) formalism including the Lea-Catcheside time factor. DNA repair foci were detected by antibodies against gH2AX and 53BP1. Irradiations were performed with 6 MV x rays, or 50 kV x rays from a surface radiotherapy machine (Dermopan, Siemens) or a miniaturized x ray machine for IORT (Intrabeam, Carl Zeiss Surgical GmbH). Results: The V79 and MCF7 cell lines showed split-dose recovery indicating SLD repair for 2x6 Gy or 2x4 Gy (yielding surviving fractions, SF ~ 0.004-0.006 for single total-dose irradiation). The SLD repair halftime for split-dose intervals up to 40 min increased from 15 to 25 min for V79, but was constant at 39 min for MCF7. Skin fibroblasts showed no SLD repair up to 6 h post-irradiation which was associated with absence of a shoulder on the survival curve. SLD repair was validated for split-dose irradiation with 50 kV x rays from Dermopan, using V79 cells. The kinetics of induction and decay of gH2AX foci after acute irradiation was similar in all three cell types with rapid induction to a maximum at 30 min post irradiation followed by a decay, and with few residual foci at 24 h. The maximum number of foci produced by 4.7 Gy of 50 kV x rays from Intrabeam at the highest dose rate in air (~0.42 Gy/min) was comparable to 6 Gy of 6 MV x rays (6 Gy/min) consistent with an RBE ~1.3 but decreased at larger distances as the total irradiation time increased. The dose-response for 53BP1 in fibroblasts suggested efficient repair at low doses (0-2 Gy) but increasing saturation at higher doses (8-16 Gy). Conclusions: The repair halftime for the breast cancer cell line was comparable with the duration of IORT. Thus SLD repair is relevant for protracted dose delivery during IORT with 50 kV x rays and should be included when modeling RBE and clinical outcome. DNA repair proficiency of the skin fibroblast strain in the absence of SLD repair suggested that DNA repair foci are unlikely to represent SLD. Although evidence exists that the clinical risk of late reaction may be determined primarily by other factors than cellular radiosensitivity of fibroblasts, the present findings could be important for the mechanistic interpretation of the L-Q formalism.",,0

The purpose was to determine the relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of 50-kV x-rays for inactivation of cells irradiated in a tumor-bed phantom. Methods and Materials: The RBE was determined for clonogenic inactivation of human tumor and normal cells (MCF7, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, normal skin fibroblasts), and hamster V79 cells. The 50-kV x-rays from the Intrabeam machine (Carl Zeiss Surgical) with a spherical 4-cm applicator were used. Cells were irradiated in a water-equivalent phantom at defined distances (8.1-22.9 mm) from the applicator surface. The 50-kV x-rays from a surface therapy machine (Dermopan, Siemens) were included for comparison; 6-MV x-rays were used as reference radiation. Results: At 8.1-mm depth in the phantom (dose rate 15.1 Gy/h), mean RBE values of 50-kV x-rays from Intrabeam were 1.26 to 1.42 for the 4 cell types at doses yielding surviving fractions in the range of 0.01 to 0.5. Confidence intervals were in the range of 1.2 and 1.5. Similar RBE values were found for 50-kV x-rays from Dermopan for V79 (1.30, CI 1.25-1.36, P=.74) and GS4 (1.42, CI 1.30-1.54, P=.67). No significant dependence of RBE on dose was found for Intrabeam, but RBE decreased at a larger distance (12.7 mm; 9.8 Gy/h). Conclusions: An increased clinically relevant RBE was found for cell irradiation with Intrabeam at depths in the tumor bed targeted by IORT. The reduced RBE values at larger distances may be related to increased repair of sublethal damage during protracted irradiation or to hardening of the photon beam energy. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Thus continuous induction and repair of sub-lethal damage (SLD) during treatment may affect the relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) and clinical outcome. The purpose of the present work was to determine the half-time T1/2 of SLD repair and to study the relationship between SLD and DSB repair in vitro. Materials: V79 hamster cells, the human breast cancer cell line MCF7, and early-passage, normal human skin fibroblast, GS4, were used. Split-dose irradiation with two acute doses of 6 MV x rays (6 Gy/min) was used to determine recovery of cell survival as function of the time interval. The surviving fraction (SF) was determined by the colony formation assay and survival curves were fitted by the linear-quadratic formalism. T1/2 was determined from the Lea-Catcheside time factor for continuous induction and repair of SLD. Induction and decay of DNA repair foci for DSB was monitored by immunocytochemistry with gammaH2AX antibody. 50 kV x rays from a surface therapy machine (Siemens Dermopan 2 with 1 mm Al filter, dose rate 0.45 Gy/min) and the miniaturized x rays machine (IntrabeamPRS400, Carl Zeiss Surgical GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany; 4 cm spherical applicator) were used to validate results at low photon energy. Results: SLD repair was observed for V79 and MCF7 but not for normal fibroblasts (time intervals 45 min-6h). SLD repair after irradiation with 50 kV x rays from Dermopan, was validated using V79 cells. The kinetics of SLD repair during time intervals relevant for IORT was determined for two acute doses of 6 Gy (V79) or 4 Gy (MCF7) with time intervals of 5-40 min. Initial T1/2 was 15 min for V79 with a slowing down of the repair rate after 10-15 min. For MCF7, T1/2 was constant at 39 min over the split-dose range tested. The kinetics of induction and decay of gammaH2AX foci after acute irradiation was similar in all three cell types. The maximum number of foci in V79 produced by a fixed dose of 4.7 Gy of 50 kV x rays from Intrabeam was found to decrease with decreasing dose rates. Conclusions: SLD repair was observed in two of three cell lines with halftimes relevant for the time required to deliver IORT with 50 kV x rays. Thus the effect of continuous induction and repair of SLD during protracted irradiation should be included when modelling RBE and clinical outcome of IORT with low-energy x rays. Although normal skin fibroblasts showed no split-dose recovery (interpreted as SLD repair), all three cell types were proficient in DNA repair as detected by gammaH2AX foci suggesting that SLD is not identical to lesions detected by gammaH2AX. Since cellular radiosensitivity of fibroblasts was not indicative for clinical risk of late fibrosis in previous studies, experimental studies of dose rate effects on normal-tissue reaction may require in vivo models.",,0

Paget's disease is a rare clinical and histological type of local recurrence (LR) after breast cancer treatment both in case of conservative surgery or nipplesparing mastectomy (NSM) with or without intraoperative radiation. Methods. We performed an analysis of 861 NSM with electron beam intraoperative radiotherapy (ELIOT) patients treated at the European Institute of Oncology from 2002 to 2008, focused on Paget's disease local recurrence. Results. In 861 patients (713 invasive carcinoma and 148 intraepithelial neoplasia), there were 36 local recurrences (4.18%), and among these were 7 Paget's disease local recurrences (0.8%). Median follow-up was 50 months. Four cases presented with nipple areola complex (NAC) erosions, two crusted lesions, and one ulcerated NAC. The average latency period from the NSM to Paget's disease local recurrence is 32 months (range, 12-49). Complete NAC removal was performed in all seven recurrences. The average follow-up after NAC removal was 47.4 months (range, 20-78). We found neither locoregional relapse nor metastatic event in this group. All patients were alive without disease. Conclusions. Paget's disease local recurrence can be found in a significant proportion after NSM. Any suspicious lesion on NAC requires prompt pathological confirmation. Primary carcinoma with ductal intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive ductal carcinoma with extensive in situ component, negative hormonal receptor, high pathological grade, overexpression of HER2/neu, and HER2 positive (nonluminal)"" subtype tend to be significantly associated with more Paget's disease local recurrence and should be followed carefully. © 2012 Society of Surgical Oncology.""",,0

The main complication of NSM is nipple areolar complex (NAC) necrosis, and it is usually related to surgical technique. However, the patients' clinicopathological factors should be also considered. Method: We retrospectively reviewed 934 consecutive NSM patients during 2002-2007 at the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy. We identified a group of patient who had NAC excision because of NAC necrosis and compared this group with those who had successful NAC conservation. We analyzed the association between the risk of NAC necrosis and the clinicopathological features of the patients. Results: Among 934 NSM, 772 were invasive cancers and 162 were in situ cancers. Of the 934, 40 NAC (4.2 %) were removed during the postoperative period because of necrosis. When we considered age, BMI, menopausal status, smoking status, tumor size, axillary lymph node status, in situ or invasive cancer histology, presence of extensive situ component, grading, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2/neu overexpression, Ki-67 proliferative index, and peritumoral vascular invasion, no association was observed between patients' clinicopathological features and NAC necrosis incidence. Conclusions: In our study, clinicopathological features have no significant impact on necrosis complication in therapeutic NSMs. Positive retroareolar margin is the risk of necrosis. Further studies are required to avoid bias due to the different cancer treatments such as different reconstruction techniques and intraoperative radiation protocols. The correlation between breast morphology and NAC necrosis should also be investigated in the future. © 2012 Society of Surgical Oncology.",,0

Treatment cost for conventional fractionation 3DCRT was 6.518,81 , whereas the hypofractionated regimen using the same technology cost was 4.737,76 . PBI costs were 3.078,60 , 4.483,49 , 4.075,36 , and 7.418,46 for 3DCRT, LDR brachytherapy, HDR brachytherapy, and IORT, respectively. Conclusions. Besides personal, emotional and working considerations, PBI treatment administration appears to be the more economic option, being the 3DCRT the cheapest technique. Multidisciplinary teams offering breast conservation to women with early-stage breast cancer should consider accelerated radiation regimens offering comparable therapeutic benefit with use of fewer Public Health Care Euros.",,0

Our aim is to share our experience of metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and radiochromic films with patients undergoing IOERT using a general-purpose linac. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used MOSFETs inserted into sterile bronchus catheters and radiochromic films that were cut, digitized, and sterilized by means of gas plasma. In all, 59 measurements were taken from 27 patients involving 15 primary tumors (seven breast and eight non-breast tumors) and 12 relapses. Data were subjected to an outliers' analysis and classified according to their compatibility with the relevant doses. Associations were sought regarding the type of detector, breast and non-breast irradiation, and the radiation oncologist's assessment of the difficulty of detector placement. At the same time, 19 measurements were carried out at the tumor bed with both detectors. RESULTS: MOSFET measurements ([Formula: see text] = 93.5 %, sD = 6.5 %) were not significantly shifted from film measurements ([Formula: see text] = 96.0 %, sD = 5.5 %; p = 0.109), and no associations were found (p = 0.526, p = 0.295, and p = 0.501, respectively). As regards measurements performed at the tumor bed with both detectors, MOSFET measurements ([Formula: see text] = 95.0 %, sD = 5.4 % were not significantly shifted from film measurements ([Formula: see text] = 96.4 %, sD = 5.0 %; p = 0.363). CONCLUSION: In vivo dosimetry can produce satisfactory results at every studied location with a general-purpose linac. Detector choice should depend on user factors, not on the detector performance itself. Surgical team collaboration is crucial to success.",eng,0

In vivo dosimetry has been recommended for IOERT and has been identified as a risk-reduction intervention in the context of an IOERT risk analysis. Despite reports of fruitful experiences, information about in vivo dosimetry in intraoperative radiotherapy is somewhat scarce. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to report our experience in developing a program of in vivo dosimetry for IOERT, from both multidisciplinary and practical approaches, in a consistent patient series. We also report several current weaknesses. Methods: Reinforced TN-502RDM-H mobile metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and Gafchromic MD-55-2 films were used as a redundant in vivo treatment verification system with an Elekta Precise fixed linear accelerator for calibrations and treatments. In vivo dosimetry was performed in 45 patients in cases involving primary tumors or relapses. The most frequent primary tumors were breast (37 %) and colorectal (29 %), and local recurrences among relapses was 83 %. We made 50 attempts to measure with MOSFETs and 48 attempts to measure with films in the treatment zones. The surgical team placed both detectors with supervision from the radiation oncologist and following their instructions. Results: The program was considered an overall success by the different professionals involved. The absorbed doses measured with MOSFETs and films were 93.8 +/- 6.7 % and 97.9 +/- 9.0 % (mean +/- SD) respectively using a scale in which 90 % is the prescribed dose and 100 % is the maximum absorbed dose delivered by the beam. However, in 10 % of cases we experienced dosimetric problems due to detector misalignment, a situation which might be avoided with additional checks. The useful MOSFET lifetime length and the film sterilization procedure should also be controlled. Conclusions: It is feasible to establish an in vivo dosimetry program for a wide set of locations treated with IOERT using a multidisciplinary approach according to the skills of the professionals present and the detectors used; oncological surgeons' commitment is key to success in this context. Films are more unstable and show higher uncertainty than MOSFETs but are cheaper and are useful and convenient if real-time treatment monitoring is not necessary.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 39 patients (17 women and 22 men) with a total of 125 liver metastases were treated with percutaneous or intraoperative CEUS-guided MW ablation. The primary tumor was colorectal cancer (n = 31), breast cancer (n = 6), carcinoid tumor (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 1). The median number of metastases ablated in the 45 treatment sessions was 2 (range 1 - 11). The median size (maximum diameter) of the 125 metastases was 1.5 cm (range, 0.6 - 4.0 cm). Nineteen (15 %) of the 125 metastases were bigger than 2 cm. Metastases smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single needle, metastases bigger than 2 cm were treated with 2 or 3 parallel needles. RESULTS: The 45 MW ablation sessions were performed percutaneously (n = 30), during laparotomy (n = 3), or during laparotomy combined with liver resection (n = 12). The 39 patients were followed up for at least 4 months with a median duration of 11 months (range, 4 - 20 months). The technical success rate was 100 %. The clinical effectiveness was 100 % with complete coverage of the metastasis by the avascular coagulation zone evaluated on immediate post-ablation CEUS. Local tumor progression (local recurrence) was seen in 12 (9.6 %) of the 125 treated metastases, and affected 10 (26 %) of the 39 patients. One major complication was observed in the form of a liver abscess that easily resolved after percutaneous drainage. Four minor complications were observed: Three cases of pain located at the puncture site and one case of ascites. CEUS was valuable in all phases of ablation including pre-ablation staging and procedure planning, placement of MW needles in the tumor, immediate post-ablation control of coagulation size, and finally in the long term follow-up regime. CONCLUSION: CEUS-guided MW ablation of liver metastases is an efficient and safe ablation technique with several advantages compared to other ablation modalities.",eng,0

Post irradiation dosimetry verification is performed using real-time imaging acquired with an O-arm following catheter insertion. We report on our initial dosimetric findings. Materials and Methods: 8 patients aged 70 +/- 7 years with stage 1 ER+ invasive ductal cancers received 20Gy in one fraction prescribed to the balloon surface between November 2014 - December 2015. Dosimetric parameters were also obtained at 1cm from the balloon surface. CT dosimetry, including contouring of target volumes (balloon and 1cm margin) and delineation of critical structures (5mm skin and rib), treatment planning and dose optimization was conducted using Varian Brachyvision software. Results: Overall, D90 97.8% +/- 11.4% and D95 90.3% +/- 13.8% for prescription dose at the balloon surface. Average D90 is 20.1Gy at the prescription point (balloon surface). At 1cm D90 36.3%+/- 4.4% and D95 32.5%+/-4.7%. Average D90 is 7.2Gy at 1cm from the prescription point. Dose to critical structures averaged 62.4% (max 174.3%, min 24.6%) and 52.2% (max 89%, min 34%) of prescription dose to the skin and ribs respectively. Complications included an asymmetric balloon (1) which affected dose to the critical structures (174.3% Rx dose to the skin) and the prescription site (D90 86.5%, 17.3Gy). In addition, due to the limitations of the O-arm and patient anatomy, 1 patient did not receive post operative CT planning. Conclusions: Our data highlights the unique post operative dosimetric characteristics for IORT made possible through use of an O-arm. Post operative dosimetry confirms dose coverage at surface and at 1cm. Additionally, suboptimal implants can be revealed which may help clinical decision making.",,0

There is a relative paucity of data demonstrating patient factors that predict complications specifically by stage of surgery. The present study attempts to determine what complications are most likely to occur at each stage and how the risk factors for complications vary by stage of reconstruction. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all 1275 patients who had TEs placed by the 2 senior authors between 2004 and 2013. Complication rates were determined at each stage of reconstruction, and these rates were further compared between patients who had pre-stage I radiation, post-stage I radiation, and no radiation exposure. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of complications at each stage of reconstruction. RESULTS: A total of 1639 consecutive TEs were placed by the senior authors during the study period. The overall rate for experiencing a complication at any stage of surgery was 17%. Complications occurred at uniformly higher rates during stage I for all complications (92% stage I vs 7% stage II vs 1% stage III, P < 0.001). Predictors of stage I complications included increased body mass index [odds ratio (OR), 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.07], current smoking status (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.7-4.8), and higher intraoperative percent fill (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.7-6.3). Post-stage I radiation was the only independent risk factor for a stage II complication (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.4-15.2). CONCLUSIONS: Complications occur at higher rates after stage I than after stage II, and as expected, stage III complications are exceedingly rare. Risk factors for stage I complications are different from risk factors for stage II complications. Body mass index and smoking are associated with complications at stage I, but do not predict complications at stage II surgery. The stratification of risk factors by stage of surgery will help surgeons and patients better manage both risk and expectations.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1998 and 2004, 258 early-stage breast cancer patients were randomized to receive 50 Gy WBI (n = 130) or PBI (n = 128). The latter consisted of either 7 x 5.2 Gy HDR-BT (n = 88) or 50 Gy ELE (n = 40). The incidence of fat necrosis, its impact on cosmetic outcome, accompanying radiologic features, and clinical symptoms were evaluated. RESULTS: The 4-year actuarial rate of fat necrosis was 31.1% for all patients, and 31.9%, 36.5%, and 17.7% after WBI, HDR-BT and ELE, respectively (p(WBI/HDR-BT) = 0.26; p(WBI/ELE) = 0.11; p(ELE/HDR-BT) = 0.025). The respective rate of asymptomatic fat necrosis was 20.2%, 25.3%, and 10% of patients. The incidence of symptomatic fat necrosis was not significantly different after WBI (8.5%), HDR-BT (11.4%), and ELE (7.5%). Symptomatic fat necrosis was significantly associated with a worse cosmetic outcome, whereas asymptomatic fat necrosis was not. Fat necrosis was detectable with mammography and/or ultrasound in each case. Additional imaging examinations were required in 21% of cases and aspiration cytology in 42%. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic fat necrosis is a common adverse event of breast-conserving therapy, having no significant clinical relevance in the majority of the cases. The incidence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic fat necrosis is similar after conventional WBI and accelerated partial-breast HDR-BT.",eng,0

Materials and Methods: We were studied 3 different shielding materials copper, lead and steel with different thicknesses. The measurements were performed using calibrated films EBT2, positioned parallel to the beam axis, with electrons energies 6, 9 and 12 MeV produced with a mobile accelerator Mobetron 1000J. Then, for the same energy, it is estimated the thickness of plexiglas required to reduce the amount of backscattered radiation and meets the ICRU criteria. Results: The PDD without shield performed with radiochromic film and Markus ionization chamber showed a correspondence between the curves obtained with the two systems at least until the bremsstrahlung region. This has allowed us the use of EBT2 as a reference dosimeter for the subsequent measures of backscattered radiation. The evaluation has been made as the difference between PDD with shield at depth R90 and those without shield. This were in steel, independent for all energies used between thickness 3 and 4 mm, lower than 15% of maximum dose; for copper instead backscattered radiation has been independent of the energy is lower than 20-25% for thicknesses 2 and 4 mm and significantly higher for the thickness of 6mm. For lead, it was obtained a substantial indifference between the thicknesses shield of 1 and 2 mm for all energies, and backscattered radiation was found to be greater than 25%. Finally the shield needed to reduce the radiation transmitted was optimized using a 3 mm thick plexiglas which showed a reduction of the radiation backscattered up to 5%, while with a 5mm thick plexiglas reduction is lower. Conclusions: We have concluded that the thickness to be used to optimize the dose distribution in IORT breast treatment with Mobetron accelerator is 3mm of steel or 2mm of copper with a thickness of 3mm plexiglas to reduce the radiation scattered from high atomic number material.",,0

Harrison,2014.0,Modern brachytherapy,10.1053/j.seminoncol.2014.09.015,"Brachytherapy consists of placing radioactive sources within, or directly adjacent to a tumor, and is a means of delivering highly targeted and conformal radiation. While its history dates back to the origins of the field, in recent years brachytherapy treatment paradigms have been evolving considerably. This has been driven primarily by advancements in imaging, which allow for precise placement of sources and applicators under image guidance, and volume-based optimization to ensure adequate tumor coverage while sparing adjacent normal tissue. There has been a shift towards high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for many of the disease sites treated with brachytherapy. Simultaneously, with increasingly conformal treatment, there has been a shift towards utilization of higher doses per fraction, over fewer fractions, for specific disease sites where hypofractionation is believed to confer a radiobiological benefit. Here we review recent data and trends for those disease sites and conditions that are commonly treated with brachytherapy, including prostate, gynecologic, breast, head and neck, and skin cancers and salvage of recurrent disease.",eng,0

Dose measurements during intraoperative radiotherapy (ELIOT) in the subclavicular (SVC) region, where a cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) would be positioned, were performed in patients without heart disease. The study aim is to verify that the dose does not exceed 2 Gy, that is the recommended maximum dose to the CIEDs. Material and Methods: This analysis was performed on 20 patients, which underwent breast conserving surgery. After tumor removal and before delivering ELIOT, two catheters, each of them containing 8 thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), were positioned. The first catheter, the internal one, was attached to the thoracic shielding and became an integral part of it. The shielding was located beneath the reconstructed breast parenchyma of the tumor bed, to minimize the underlying dose, and the catheter tip was positioned in the SVC region. The second catheter, the external one, was placed on the skin, parallel to the first one, next to the applicator. The TLD reading showed the absorbed dose due to the scattered dose correlated to the distance from the applicator. Results: For a prescribed dose of 21 Gy at 90% isodose, the doses measured by the external catheter TLDs were homogenous and below the CIED threshold (mean dose: 0.38 Gy, range: 0.10-0.80 Gy). The doses measured by the internal catheter TLDs varied according to the distance from the applicator. At 2.5 cm distance from the applicator, the internal TLD doses were lower than those detected by their external counterparts. Conclusions: ELIOT seems to be safe for patients using CIEDs as long as the minimum distance of 2.5 cm is kept between the CIED edge and the applicator wall.

Materials/Methods: From December 2008 to March 2013, 75 breast cancer patients (ages 34 - 66 years) were treated with IOERT during breast conservative surgery. IOERT was delivered using a mobile LINAC. Suitable energy and applicator size were chosen to ensure coverage of the tumor with anterior and posterior margins of 1 cm and lateral margins of 2 cm. Patients with sentinel node metastases or younger than 40 years received 8 Gy as boost followed by a post-operative external beam radiation therapy of 50 Gy in 25 fractions; the others had 15 Gy prescribed to the 90% isodose depth. The dose rate was 10 Gy/min. for all patients. Adjuvant treatment consisted of chemotherapy alone (14 patients), hormonal therapy alone (18 patients), or combined chemotherapy and hormonal therapy (41 patients). Two patients had no adjuvant treatment. The safety, cosmesis, and short-term efficacy were evaluated. Results: Median follow-up was 49 months (range: 19 - 58 months). Two (2.7%) patients developed post-surgical hematoma. Six (8.0%) patients developed mild breast fibrosis. Eight (10.7%) patients suffered from local pain. One (1.2%) patient experienced a post-operative infection. Sixteen (21.3%) patients developed Grade 1 pulmonary fibrosis. Forty-three (57.3%) patients had an excellent cosmetic result and 23 (30.7%) had a good cosmetic result. Three patients had an ipsilateral breast recurrence, with an actual 3-year local recurrence rate of 4.5%. One patient had an ipsilateral axillary recurrence, resulting in a 3-year regional recurrence rate of 1.4%. No distant metastasis or death was observed. The 3-year disease free survival rate was 94.2%. Conclusions: IORT delivered prior to lumpectomy is safe and feasible for selected patients with early-stage breast cancer. Early side effects, cosmesis and short-term efficacy are acceptable, but a longer follow-up is needed for evaluation of late side effects and long-term efficacy.",,0

A standard course of radiation consists of 5-7 weeks of daily radiation treatments delivered to the whole breast. The success of this treatment has led investigators to attempt to determine whether the same control can be achieved while decreasing the volume of breast tissue irradiated, thus allowing treatment to be delivered in a shorter period of time. This approach could alleviate time and logistical problems faced by patients during their course of treatment as well as improving overall cost-effectiveness. It can also allow complete avoidance of the adjacent heart and lung tissue in the radiation treatment portal. Partial-breast irradiation (the delivery of radiation to the resection cavity, plus a safety margin) delivered in just hours or days, is currently under investigation. Although relatively new, its use is growing rapidly and many institutional and cooperative group trials are quickly enlisting patients, while physicians are gaining experience in a variety of partial-breast Irradiation techniques. © 2007 Future Drugs Ltd.",,0

External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or conventional surgical decompression of the spinal cord often results in unsatisfactory neurological recovery and local recurrence. To improve neurological recovery and local control in such cases, we introduced intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) combined with posterior surgery in 1992. We report the results for neurological recovery and local control in patients who received IORT combined with posterior surgery. Materials/Methods: Between November 1992 and March 2009, 158 cases (133 patients) were treated using IORT combined with posterior surgery for spinal paresis due to spinal metastases of breast, renal, thyroid, colorectal, and lung cancer. 99 cases were nonambulatory and 59 cases ambulatory before surgery. After posterior decompression, a single large dose of electron beam irradiation was delivered to the exposed metastatic lesion. Percentage dose in the spinal cord was approximately 10 - 25% with a lead shield, however, scattering of electron beams spread from behind the shielded central spinal cord region to reach the posterior region of the vertebra body located directly anterior to the spinal cord. Median dose of IORTwas 20 Gy (range, 10 - 35 Gy), and median energy was 16 MeV (range, 11 - 22 MeV). 61 cases were treated with EBRT before the surgery; the delivered median dose was 40 Gy (range, 7.5 - 60 Gy). 41 cases were treated with EBRT after the surgery; the delivered median dose was 35 Gy (range, 8 - 50.5 Gy). Results: Neurologic improvement of at least one level according to Frankel's classification was attained in 106 cases (67%) with a median follow-up period of 12.8 months. Spinal paralysis completely disappeared after surgery in 34 cases (22%). Of all 158 cases, 136 cases (86%) were ambulatory after surgery. Of the 99 cases nonambulatory before surgery, 78 cases (80%) became ambulatory after surgery. Postoperatively, 14 cases (9%) experienced local recurrence and neurologic exacerbation of at least one level according to Frankel's classification. The median time to local recurrence was 10.6 months (range, 3.0 - 40.6 months) after the surgery. For all 158 cases, median survival time was 18.5 months (range, 0.5 - 111.8 months) after the surgery. One patient experienced radiation myelopathy, and another patient experienced radiation neuropathy of cauda equina during the followup period. Conclusions: IORT combined with posterior surgery is a useful technique for the treatment of spinal cord compression caused by spinal metastasis, offering significant neurologic recovery and a low rate of local recurrence.",,0

This method aims to minimize repeat excision and local recurrence rates. The ABLATE Registry expands this to multiple centers with a total accrual goal of 250. This video illustrates an intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA) technique. METHODS: Sixteen women with a mean age of 65 years underwent RFA after lumpectomy. The RFA probe was deployed 1 cm circumferentially in the cavity and maintained at 100 degrees C for 15 min. The ablation zone was monitored with color-flow ultrasound. Patients returned 2 weeks later to complete the Subjective Cosmetic Scale and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Body Image Scale. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 3.9 months, there were no local recurrences. Two-week cosmesis scores were excellent (n = 9) or good (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience is encouraging.

METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively gathered electronic records of all radiotherapy for cancer at nine provincial cancer treatment centres. RESULTS: Over the 12 years of the study, the incidence of cancer increased by 33%. The number of curative and adjuvant courses per incident case increased by 39.3% and the number of palliative courses per incident case decreased by 15.8%. The mean number of fractions per curative and adjuvant course increased by 13%, and the mean number of fractions per palliative course decreased by 22%. The number of curative fractions per incident case increased by 63%, and the number of palliative fractions per incident case decreased by 32%. The increase in curative workload was mainly due to an increase in the incidence of prostate cancer, to an increase in the number of courses per incident case in breast and prostate cancer, and to an increase in the number of fractions per curative course in every disease group. The decrease in palliative workload was due to a decrease in the number of courses per incident case in most disease groups, and to a decrease in the number of fractions per course in most disease groups. CONCLUSIONS: In Ontario, between 1984 and 1995, there was a large shift in workload from palliative radiotherapy to curative radiotherapy. Potential causes for this phenomenon are discussed.",eng,0

We evaluated the frequency of lymphatic drainage to the IM chain, the rate of SLNs that contain metastases and the clinical implications of IM LN metastases. METHODS: Between June 1999 and April 2005 506 consecutive patients underwent SLN biopsy as a staging procedure for clinically T1-2N0 breast cancer. In all patients preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was combined with the intraoperative use of a gammaprobe. In patients with IM SLNs visualized on lymphoscintigraphy, LNs were extirpated through an intercostal parasternal incision. RESULTS: SLNs were visualized by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy in 99% of all patients (502/506): axillary SLNs in 499 patients (99%), ipsilateral IM LNs in 109 patients (22%). In 85 patients with visualized IM SLNs the IM nodes could be removed (78%). In 20 of the latter 85 patients IM SLNs contained metastases (24%). IM metastases were associated with axillary LN metastases (P < 0.001). In 17 patients IM metastases led to extension of the radiotherapy field, while additional (adjuvant) systemic therapy was given in six patients. CONCLUSION: SLNs in the IM chain are common in breast cancer patients and can be extirpated in the majority of these patients. The proportion of patients in whom radiotherapeutic treatment was adjusted due to IM LN metastases was substantial. We advocate retrieval of IM SLNs when visualized by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy.",eng,0

When applied intraoperatively is feasible to provide all local treatment in one intervention. Methods:This is a prospective study of patients with early breast invasive ductal carcinoma treated with conservative surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy with 50kV X-ray system, receiving a dose between 20-22Gy to the surgical bed. All patients underwent additional MRI or 3-D mammography to rule out multifocal disease. We analyzed the characteristics of the tumor, lymph node involvement, molecular subtype, adjuvant treatment and follow-up to assess the incidence of local relapse. Results: 131 patients were included, the average age was 58.8 years (44-79 years old), average tumor size of 1.44cm (0.4 to 3.2cm), negative surgical margin was considered as no tumor cells in the inked margin, 26 patients had at least one positive node, 20% had lymphovascular invasion, 68% were luminal A, 18.7% luminal B, 2.5 % HER2 +, 9.8% and triple negative. In 14 patients an onclopastic procedure were performed and two patients were treated with bilateral conservative surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy. Adjuvant hormonal therapy was received by 53% of the patients, chemotherapy in 10 %, chemotherapy + hormonal therapy in 19%, 16% required adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy because of adverse prognostic factors for local recurrence and 2% required total mastectomy for a positive surgical margins. At a median follow up of 18 months, no patient had local or regional relapse. Fourteen patients had complications, of which 12 were minor (infection, seroma or dehiscence) resolved in office and 2 mayor requiring reoperation for debridement of the wound and another patient present severe infection treated with intravenous antibiotics. Conclusions: Intraoperative radiation therapy after conservative surgery is a safe procedure with low morbidity and provides the all local treatment in one intervention in selected cases, is necessary a longer period of surveillance to assess local recurrence.",,0

Materials: We measured Entrance and Exit doses by EBT2 gafchromic films and compared them with the expected values.The calibration of the film was carried out on a 10 MeV electron beam from a conventional LINAC (Elekta Precise), using a plane parallel chamber (PTW Markus Chamber) for absolute dose measurements.The 16 bit signal from the films was acquired by a commercial flat-bed scanner (EPSON 10000XL: white light, CCD reading system), and filtered in the green channel.Monitor Units were corrected for daily pressure and output (the temperature of the head was assumed to be constant).Surface Dose (DSUP) was measured by a small piece of EBT2 gafchromic film, wrapped in a sterile drape and put at the exit of the collimator. Exit Dose (DD ) was measured by a circular cut of gafchromic film of the same dimensions of the shielding disk, attached on it and enveloped in a sterile drape.Expected Entrance Dose (De-in) is the dose prescribed by the Radiotherapist at the depth of maximum dose (Dmax) Expected Exit Dose (De-ex) is the dose estimated at the depth of the disk. The depth is measured by the surgeon and the dose is derived by correcting the dose prescribed at Dmax for the PDD value.Measured Entrance Dose (Dm-in) at Dmax is obtained from the gafchromic reading at the surface (DSUP), corrected by FSI, the measured multiplying factor, which gives the dose at Dmax: Dmin = (FSI )d,En.DSUPMeasured Exit Dose, (Dm-ex), is obtained correcting the Exit Dose measured on the disk (DD) by the measured backscatter factor of the Disk (BS): Dm-ex =(1-(BS)En) .DD.The overall uncertainty of the dose values determined by this method is estimated to be around 4% (1SD). Results: For the first 23 patients, the (mean difference +/- 1SD) between expected and measured entrance doses is (-0.6% +/- 3.4%).Between expected and measured exit doses is (+5,0% +/- 7.7%).The analysis was performed also grouping the results per collimator: no correlation or systematic effects were observed. (Table presented) Conclusions: The good agreement between measured and expected entrance dose confirms the reliability of our MUs calculation method.On the contrary, the significant difference between expected and measured exit doses shows that many unpredictable factors affect this data: uncertainty on depth estimation, irregular surfaces, accumulation of biological fluid, tissue density and temperature, machine/patient setup, uncertainty of backscatter factor& Exit dose measurements and their influencing factors are now under further investigation.",,0

This finding has led to increasing popularity of single-quadrant brachy therapy. IORT is a single dose given in the operating room. It can be used as the complete course of radiation therapy or as a boost. We explored whether digital mammography, ultrasonography, and contrast-enhanced MRI could be used preoperatively to select patients who met our protocol requirements for single-dose IORT. Methods: A prospective, IRB-approved, clinical trial of IORT using the Xoft Axxent System was designed. To be included, patients had to have an invasive carcinoma (ductal or lobular) or DCIS spanning 30 mm or less (measurement included all foci of disease), lymph nodes had to be negative [N0(i+) ok], and final margin width had to be at least 2 mm. Patients who failed 1 or more criteria were advised to undergo whole-breast, external beam radiation therapy in addition to IORT, which became the boost dose. All patients had preoperative digital mammography, contrast-enhanced MRI (unless contraindicated) and ultrasonography of the involved breast and axilla. Results: From April 2010 through September 2013, 213 patients were enrolled (216 breasts). Thirteen breasts had positive sentinel nodes on frozen section and were not treated with IORT; 201 patients (203 breasts) were treated. Overall, 68 of 216 (31.5%) breasts failed 1 or more pathologic criteria. Twenty (9.3%) patients failed due to tumor size. One hundred forty-eight breasts (68.5%) were successfully treated and required no additional whole-breast radiotherapy or re-excision. Thirty-three patients underwent whole-breast radiation therapy in addition to IORT; 6 patients opted for mastectomy. There have been no recurrences (0%), but follow-up is short (median, 12 months). (Table Presented) Conclusion: Preoperative imaging with digital mammography, ultrasonography, and contrast-enhanced MRI was accurate 68.5% of the time in selecting patients who met our criteria for IORT. Imaging, however, cannot be expected to find small metastases in lymph nodes and plays only a minor role in determining margin width. When selecting patients based on tumor size alone, imaging was accurate 90.7% of the time. IORT is particularly attractive for older patients, patients living in rural communities with poor access to radiation treatment centers, and those with busy lifestyles who find it difficult to attend daily treatments for 6 to 7 weeks. If long-term recurrence rates remain low and adequate reimbursement occurs, IORT will increase in popularity.",,0

Follow up after this approach has shown that about 90% of local recurrence occurs at the same quadrant or close to the tumor bed as well as studies of pathology. Based on the experience of Milan we have started a study protocol of intraoperative electron beam radiation (IORT), in september, 2005. Purpose: to evaluate the feasibility, acute complications and cosmetic results of partial breast radiation therapy with electron beam, in patients submitted to conservative surgery and sentinel node dissection. Elegibity criteria: T< or = 3 cm, clinically N0, no EIC, free surgical margins, unilateral tumo. Method: from sep/2005 to may/2008 we have evaluated 75 patients. All patients were submitted to conservative surgery at the Department of Radiation Therapy, in a surgical room near the Linear Accelerator. After removal of the tumor and histopathological analysis (tumor size, surgical margins and sentinel nodal status), the surgeon places the plaque (made of lead and aluminium) to protect the chest wall and closes the tumor bed; the radiation oncologist measures the depth of the tumor bed to choose the electron beam energy, and puts the cone in place. The patient then is taken to the Linac room and we proceed to the irradiation. The dose is 21 Gy, isodose of 90%. After that we return to the surgical room and the surgical procedure is finished. Demographic caracteristics of the patients:mean age 58 years, breast side right 32(42%) left breast 43(58%), race white 66(88%) not white 9(12%) Results Staging - tumor size varied from 0.3 to 2.5 cm at histopatologic analisys, nodal status was N0-63(84%), Nmic - 8 (10%) and N1-4(6%), histologic grade was GI-26(33%), GII -27(35%) and G III -22(32%)All patients were treated at a Linac, using an electron beam cone of 57 mm of intern diameter; 3 different cone angles were used according to the position of the tumor in the breast - degree 0 - 18 (24%), degree 15 - 34(45%), degree 30 - 23(31%); beam energy varied according to the depth of the breast tissue: 6 MeV - 35(47%), MeV - 35(47%),12 MeV - 4(5%),15 Mev - 1(1%). Systemic therapy 39(52%) patients had chemotherapy, 50(67%) hormonytherapy, 18(24%), none and 7(9%) are to decide (still in chemo). We observed acute complications in 6(9%) patients such as seroma and local infection, clinically solved. Cosmetic results were bad in 2(2%) patient, fair in 10(12%), good in 32(43%) and excellent in 3 (43%). As for now two patients developed axillary metastasis 13 and 28 months after IORT, and were treated with axillary dissection. Conclusion: this is a quite feasible method for partial breast irradiation, with satisfactory results in terms of acute complications and cosmetic results. For local control and late complications we still have to wait more time and the reports of open trials. Meanwhile, it should be emphasized that these patients should only be treated in a study protocol.",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A contouring study with two phases in interstitial accelerated partial breast irradiation after open cavity surgery was conducted by the Groupe Europeen de Curietherapie-European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology Breast Cancer Working Group. Contours of cavity and planning target volume (PTV) on preimplant and postimplant CT images were delineated. In Phase 1, nine radiation oncologists defined the target volumes of 5 patients, whereas in Phase 2, four observers draw the contours of 4 patients applying guidelines. In Phase 1, experience in breast BT after open cavity surgery was assessed. The delineations were compared between Phase 1 and Phase 2, the impact of guidelines was assessed, and cavity visualization score was related to consistency of delineations. RESULTS: Significant interobserver variability in delineations of lumpectomy cavity and PTV was observed among the participants. Observers with BT experience after open cavity surgery outlined the cavity and PTV more consistently (conformity indexgen: 0.52 vs. 0.48 and 0.59 vs. 0.55 for preimplant and postimplant cavities). For all volumes, the mean Vmax/Vmin was 2.2 vs. 2.8. Having used guidelines all conformity indices increased significantly. For cavity, the increase was 14% and 11%, whereas for the PTV, 28% and 17% on the preimplant and postimplant CT images, respectively. A strong correlation was found between consistency of contours and cavity visualization score. CONCLUSIONS: Simple guidelines on defining the lumpectomy cavity significantly increased the consistency of contouring.

Patients and methods: Seventeen patients treated with IB and twenty-four with MSB were selected for the study. The irradiations for IB patients were planned using conventional two-film reconstruction technique. Following the implantation each patient was CT scanned, then the planning target volume (PTV) was retrospectively defined on the CT data set, and the original plan was reconstructed (CONV plans). Furthermore, conformal plans were also created by dose optimization on target (CONF plans). The planning for MammoSiteTM applicator was based on CT imaging. The dose distributions were evaluated with dose-volume histograms. The following parameters were calculated and compared: volume of the PTV and its percentage receiving 90, 100, 150 and 200% of the prescribed dose (V90, V100, V150 and V200, respectively), percentage dose covering 90% of the PTV (D90), minimum dose in the PTV (D<inf>min</inf>), maximum dose in the PTV (D<inf>max</inf>) for MSB only, dose homogeneity index (DHI), and conformal index (COIN). To assess the dose to organs at risk maximum point dose to skin, lung and heart was used. Results: The median number of implanted catheters for IB was 11 (range: 6-13), the average balloon volume for MSB was 59.1 cm<sup>3</sup> (range: 43.4-75.3 cm<sup>3</sup>). The average volume of PTV was 63.4 and 109.6 cm<sup>3</sup> for IB and MSB patients, respectively. The average V90, V100, V150, V200 were 76, 70, 26 and 9% for IB<inf>CONV</inf>; 92, 87, 55 and 32% for IB<inf>CONF</inf> and 96, 88, 27 and 3% for MSB, respectively. The average D90 was 72, 94 and 99%, the D<inf>min</inf> was 47, 58 and 67%, respectively. The mean D<inf>max</inf> was 258% for MSB. The average DHI was 0.63, 0.37 and 0.70 for IB<inf>CONV</inf>, IB<inf>CONF</inf> and MSB, respectively. D<inf>max</inf> to skin, lung and heart were 45, 54 and 31% for IB<inf>CONV</inf>, 50, 55 and 29% for IB<inf>CONF,</inf> 97, 66 and 27% for MSB, respectively. Conclusions: Target volume coverage was better for MSB than conventional IB, and it was comparable to conformal IB. The suboptimal coverage for IB patients is due to radiography based planning, which is unable to provide 3D information of the target. Dose homogeneity was somewhat better for MSB than IB<inf>CONV</inf>, but the dose to skin and lung was higher for MSB. The MSB provides dosimetrically acceptable dose plans. The quality of interstitial implants can be improved with image-guided catheter insertions regarding both homogeneity and conformality. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",,0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients treated with IB and twenty-four with MSB were selected for the study. The irradiations for IB patients were planned using conventional two-film reconstruction technique. Following the implantation each patient was CT scanned, then the planning target volume (PTV) was retrospectively defined on the CT data set, and the original plan was reconstructed (CONV plans). Furthermore, conformal plans were also created by dose optimization on target (CONF plans). The planning for MammoSite applicator was based on CT imaging. The dose distributions were evaluated with dose-volume histograms. The following parameters were calculated and compared: volume of the PTV and its percentage receiving 90, 100, 150 and 200% of the prescribed dose (V90, V100, V150 and V200, respectively), percentage dose covering 90% of the PTV (D90), minimum dose in the PTV (D(min)), maximum dose in the PTV (D(max)) for MSB only, dose homogeneity index (DHI), and conformal index (COIN). To assess the dose to organs at risk maximum point dose to skin, lung and heart was used. RESULTS: The median number of implanted catheters for IB was 11 (range: 6-13), the average balloon volume for MSB was 59.1cm(3) (range: 43.4-75.3 cm(3)). The average volume of PTV was 63.4 and 109.6 cm(3) for IB and MSB patients, respectively. The average V90, V100, V150, V200 were 76, 70, 26 and 9% for IB(CONV); 92, 87, 55 and 32% for IB(CONF) and 96, 88, 27 and 3% for MSB, respectively. The average D90 was 72, 94 and 99%, the D(min) was 47, 58 and 67%, respectively. The mean D(max) was 258% for MSB. The average DHI was 0.63, 0.37 and 0.70 for IB(CONV), IB(CONF) and MSB, respectively. D(max) to skin, lung and heart were 45, 54 and 31% for IB(CONV), 50, 55 and 29% for IB(CONF,) 97, 66 and 27% for MSB, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Target volume coverage was better for MSB than conventional IB, and it was comparable to conformal IB. The suboptimal coverage for IB patients is due to radiography based planning, which is unable to provide 3D information of the target. Dose homogeneity was somewhat better for MSB than IB(CONV), but the dose to skin and lung was higher for MSB. The MSB provides dosimetrically acceptable dose plans. The quality of interstitial implants can be improved with image-guided catheter insertions regarding both homogeneity and conformality.",eng,0

Polgar,2016.0,Multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy versus intensity modulated external beam therapy for accelerated partial breast irradiation: A comparative treatment planning study with respect to dosimetry of organs at risk,10.1016/j.radonc.2016.08.003,"OBJECTIVE: To dosimetrically compare multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy (MIBT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with special focus on dose to normal tissues and organs at risk (OAR-s). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with early stage breast cancer treated with MIBT were selected for the study. For each patient an additional IMRT treatment plan was created using the same CT data and contours as used in MIBT plans. OAR-s included ipsilateral non-target and contralateral breast, lung of both sides, skin, ribs and heart for left sided lesions. The CTV was created from the outlined lumpectomy cavity with a total margin (surgical+radiation) of 20mm in six main directions. The PTV in IMRT plans was generated from CTV with an addition of isotropic 5mm margin. The prescribed dose was 30.1Gy with 7x4.3Gy fractionation for both techniques. From dose-volume histograms quality parameters including volumes receiving a given dose (e.g. V100, V90, V50) and doses to specified volumes (e.g. D0.01cm3, D0.1cm3, D1cm3) were calculated and compared. RESULTS: Except for high dose, non-target breast received less dose with MIBT. V90 was 3.6% vs. 4.8% and V50 was 13.7% vs. 25.5% for MIBT and IMRT, respectively. Ipsilateral lung was spared better with MIBT. Mean lung dose was 5.1% vs. 7.1%, [Formula: see text] was 39.0% vs. 54.3% and V5 was 32.9% vs. 41.7% in favour of MIBT. For left sided lesions the heart was generally irradiated by larger doses with MIBT. Mean heart dose was 4.5% vs. 2.0% and [Formula: see text] was 18.3% vs. 19.7%, correspondingly. Volumetric maximal skin doses were similar, but regarding dose to 0.1cm3 and 1cm3 of most exposed volume MIBT provided significantly less doses (76.6% vs. 94.4% and 60.2% vs. 87.8%, respectively). Ribs received less dose with MIBT with values of 45.6% vs. 69.3% for [Formula: see text] and 1.4% vs. 4.2cm3 for V50. Dose to contralateral breast and lung was low with both techniques. No significant differences were observed in maximal doses, but dose to volumes of 0.1cm3 and 1cm3 were less with MIBT for both organs. [Formula: see text] was 3.2% vs. 6.7% for breast and 3.7% vs. 5.6% for lung with MIBT and IMRT, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The target volume can be appropriately irradiated by both techniques, but MIBT generally spares normal tissues and organs at risk better than IMRT. Except for the heart, other critical structures receive less doses with brachytherapy. To observe whether these dosimetric findings translate into clinical outcome more studies are needed with assessment of toxicity profiles.",Eng,0

Accurate preoperative prediction of those women at high and low risk of surgical re-excision after breast conserving surgery (BCS) may be helpful when considering surgical planning and suitability for IORT (intraoperative radiotherapy). The size of peri-tumoural stiffness on 2D shear wave elastography (SWE) has previously been shown to enhance the size estimation on breast US in women with small breast cancers. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of 2D US, 3D US and SWE parameters to predict the need for re-excision in women undergoing immediate BCS. Methods: 214 consecutive women, diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2011 and 2015, underwent 2D US, 3D US and SWE assessment. All patients subsequently had BCS. Parameters studied were (a) diameter of the lesion on greyscale USS, (b) mean stiffness in kilopascals, (c) greyscale volume of the lesion and (d) volume of tumoural and peritumoural stiffness measured at 3D SWE. The results for each parameter were divided into quartiles and compared to re-excision rates. Statistical significance was assessed with the chi<sup>2</sup> test. Results: The cohort consisted of 214 early stage breast cancer patients, median age 62 years. 85% of cancers were pathologically graded as G2/G3, 192 were ER pos, 23 ER neg. 160 tumours were invasive ductal carcinoma, 23 invasive lobular type, 31 other type. Median whole tumour diameter (WTD) was 18 mm. 19 of 214 (9%) patients underwent re-excision of involved radial margins. Re-excision rates (%) according to each parameter divided into quartiles, are demonstrated in Table 1. SWE volume measurement in the lowest quartile was associated with only 2% re-excision rate which was statistically significant compared to the rest of the study group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Measuring the stiff volume of invasive cancers (including peri-tumoural stiffness) is able to identify a subgroup of women undergoing BCS, who have a very low rate of surgical re-excision. There is an obvious need for a study randomising patients into groups where the surgeon is or is not informed about 3D volume of the lesion. This may influence surgical planning and potentially reduce re-excision rates. (Table Presented).",,0

To get the applicated full dose of IORT translated into an increased local control it is important to reduce the re-resection rate as low as possible after IORT-boost and to achieve tumor-free resection margins before whole-breast irradiation. Methods: Between 2/2010 and 12/2012 intaoperative boost irradiation was performed after breast-conserving surgery of breast cancer using the INTRABEAM System, Carl Zeiss Surgical, Oberkochen, Germany; 20 Gy, 50 KV x-ray). Breast-conserving surgery was performed in an oncoplastic- targeted concept with segmentally formed resection specimens, which was published elsewhere in combination with IORT. The resected specimens were then analyzed by an experienced pathologist with macroscopically analysis to reveal tumor-free resection margins or close margin situations with targeted re-resectioning before IORT. Results: In 141 patients (pts.) intraoperative boost irradiation was performed. In 13% a re-excision (after IORT-boost) was performed to achieve tumor-free resection margins. In 19 out of 22 pts. (NPV 86,4%; 95% CI 66,7 to 95,3%) the final tumor-free margins were as expected during macroscopically section assessment. In 99 out of 119 pts.

Our experiences demonstrate the applicability and reliability of combining IORT boost with targeted oncoplastic breast surgery and macroscopic instantaneous sections by the pathologists to achieve optimized local outcome in breast-conserving therapy of early breast cancer. Introduction: In IORT, a single radiation dose is delivered under direct, visual inspection of the tumor bed. It, thus, improves local recurrence risk and diminishes toxicity since there is less irradiation of healthy tissue, IORT can be delivered in two settings: an IORT boost followed by a conventional regimen of external beam radiotherapy or a single IORT dose (1, 2). In The Lancet, Jayant Vaidya et al. present results of the TARGIT-A trial (3), while in The Lancet Oncology, Umberto Veronesi and colleagues present results of the ELIOT trial. Each trial compared a different type of single intraoperative radiotherapy with external whole-breast irradiation. The TARGIT-A findings add to the first report. This non-inferiority study compared one intraoperative dose of 20 Gy using a spherical applicator (point source of 50 kV energy x-rays) with whole-breast irradiation. Breast-conserving surgery was performed using lumpectomy. In Germany, a tumor-free resection margin of at least 10 mm was recommended to avoid whole-breast irradiation; with a special need for targeted oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery techniques to avoid worse cosmetic outcomes for these patients. Overall, the 5-year risk for local recurrence in the conserved breast for intraoperative radiotherapy versus whole-breast irradiation were 3.3 (95% CI 2.1-5.1) versus 1.3 (95% CI 0.7 -2.5; p=0.042). These results were acceptable in terms of the threshold of the predefined non-inferiority margin of 2.5%. To date, there have been only a few publications of studies with short-term follow-up in which IORT, provided as a boost, demonstrated the potential to prevent local recurrences in early breast cancer (2.6% at 5 years) with good to excellent cosmetic results (4). Additional open questions are the lack of the final histopathologic report when IORT is applied, the uncertainty regarding the definition of the resection margins intraoperatively and the resected irradiated volume after repeat resection. Materials and Methods: To date, in the breast centre of the University-Hospital, Cologne, according to national guidelines, IORT is used outside clinical trials only as a boost radiation followed by whole-breast irradiation. A mobile IORT device generating low-energy x-rays (50 kV) is used since 2010 for intraoperative radiation in non-lobular breast cancer without DCIS component. This IORT system is applicable to all predefined targeted oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery principles (5) (Figure). After oncoplastic wide local excision (segmentectomy) of the tumor, the applicator of the mobile device Intrabeam<sup></sup> (Carl Zeiss Surgical, Oberkochen, Germany) is placed into the tumor bed. Using purse-string sutures the segmentally-oriented resection margins of the tumor bed are narrowed to the spherical applicator (6). To prevent skin toxicity, skin margins were averted before starting IORT. Thereafter, a single dose of 20 Gy was provided at the applicator sur ace. After complete wound healing and/or chemotherapy whole-breast radiotherapy was initiated. The median treatment time of the boost intraoperatively was 24 minutes. Outpatient treatment is shortened by 1-2 weeks as a result of the omission of the external-beam boost. The resected specimens during breast surgery were analyzed by an experienced pathologist with macroscopically analysis to reveal tumor-free resection margins or close margin situations with targeted re-resectioning before IORT. Tumor-free margins were evaluated in all directions in millimeter and reported to the surgeon. Macroscopically, analysis results were combined with the results after histological examination of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue for tumor-free margin width. Results: Between 2010 and 2013 in 149 patients (pts.) intraoperative boost irradiation was performed. In 13% a reexcision (after IORT-boost) was performed to achieve tumor-free resection margins. In 39 patients the final tumor-free margins were larger than they were expected during macroscopically section assessment. Therefore, in 127 pts. (85%) the intraoperative margin-assessment of the pathologist revealed correctly tumor-free resection margins during macroscopically analysis of the resected specimens. The macroscopic instantaneous section analysis of resection margins during breast-conserving surgery is a reliable and precise method to estimate tumor-free margins before IORT (boost) irradiation. An experienced breast pathologist is able to do these margin examinations fast and economically-based. This systematic intraoperative surgical-pathological and radiation therapy approach was applicable in routine IORT use and reduced the re-excision rate to achieve tumor-free margins. The re-excision rate was acceptable and lower than reported in the literature. Discussion: The data from TARGIT-A and ELIOT reinforce the conviction that intraoperative radiotherapy during breast-conserving surgery is a reliable alternative to conventional postoperative fractionated irradiation but only in a carefully selected population at low risk of local recurrence. Since recurrence can occur after a considerable time delay, final assessment of IORT will only be valid after sufficient follow-up from the prospective randomized trials. Until then, a single IORT dose should be considered experimental. According to national guidelines in our institution, only IORT boost followed by whole-breast irradiation is performed routinely outside a clinical trial. To overcome early and late side effects and to achieve an optimized aesthetic outcome, the IORT boost is performed after segmental resection in a concept of targeted oncoplastic breast surgery on a routine basis in our institution. The macroscopic instantaneous section analysis of resection margins during breast-conserving surgery is a reliable and precise method to estimate tumor-free margins before IORT (boost) irradiation.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cohort of 226 patients with low-risk, early stage breast cancer were treated with local excision and axillary management (sentinel node biopsy with or without axillary node dissection). After the surgeon temporarily reapproximated the excision cavity, a dose of 21 Gy using IOERT was delivered to the tumor bed, with a margin of 2 cm laterally. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 46 months (range, 28-63 months), only 1 case of local recurrence was reported. The observed toxicity was considered acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: APBI using a single dose of IOERT can be delivered safely in women with early, low-risk breast cancer in carefully selected patients. A longer follow-up is needed to ascertain its efficacy compared to that of the current standard treatment of whole-breast irradiation.",eng,0

Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy versus whole breast radiotherapy for breast cancer (TARGIT-A trial): an international, prospective, randomised, non-inferiority Phase 3 trial. Lancet 376(9735), 91-102 (2010). The Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy A (TARGIT-A) trial comparing accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) versus whole-breast irradiation in early-stage breast cancer reports noninferiority of local failure rates at 4-year follow-up. These promising early results will be followed closely in coming years by results from additional randomized clinical trials comparing whole-breast irradiation with APBI. Validation of APBI by these trials as a safe and effective treatment for a select group of early-stage breast cancers will usher in a new era and a welcome advance in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. APBI has the potential to significantly decrease treatment time and cost, allow patients not previously able to undergo breast-conserving therapy given limited access to radiation facilities to undergo breast-conserving therapy, and decrease morbidity, all while maintaining adequate local control rates. However, caution and collection of further follow-up data must be advised before implementing APBI as a standard of care and before using the relatively untested technique of TARGIT as a means of delivering APBI. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.",,0

Materials and Methods: 18 patients are currently taken for the investigation. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been done for all patients followed by systemic drug therapy depending on the tumor's phenotype and lymph node status signal. When conservative surgery was allowed, lumpectomy with intraoperative radiation therapy with INTRABEAM were performed for patients according to the positive tumor response. This approach is considered to provide the additional tumor bed boost. Thereafter external beam radiotherapy performed and patients received systemic adjuvant treatment. Three patients have triple-negative tumor phenotype, 8 - luminal type A and 7 - luminal type B present. Results: Metastasis in the sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 7 patients among 18 examined patients (US exam identified suspicious metastatic lymph nodes in 3 cases). FAC regimen was assigned to 9 patients, the remaining nine patients received aromatase inhibitors (exemestane). For now, lumpectomy with intraoperative radiation therapy was done for 9 patients. Axillary lymph node dissection was done in 1 case due to the presence of 3 sentinel lymph nodes which had a metastatic change. The full complex of our treatment approach has been already made for 4 patients. Conclusion: The current research is conducted to investigate if a comprehensive approach to the treatment of resect breast cancer can be the alternative way of reconstructing plastic surgery. The usage of intraoperative radiation therapy to the tumor bed may reduce the risk of local recurrence, which was specified in previous studies. Biopsy of sentinel lymph node, performed prior systemic therapy, is justified by research results of SENTINA, and allows some patients with favorable conditions to avoid traumatic intervention by axillary lymph node dissection.",,0

Ravi,2016.0,Excellent Long-term Breast Preservation Rate After Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation Using a Balloon Device,10.1016/j.clbc.2016.02.010,"BACKGROUND: Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using a balloon device has been well tolerated. A recent retrospective population-based study showed an increase in the rate of subsequent mastectomy for patients who undergo APBI compared with whole breast radiation therapy. Our aim was to analyze the long-term results of patients treated with APBI at our institution to determine the salvage mastectomy and locoregional recurrence rates and cosmesis outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After institutional review board approval, we conducted a retrospective review of 111 patients treated from June 2003 to October 2014 at our institution for early-stage breast cancer using a balloon device. After lumpectomy and nodal staging, the patients underwent APBI with high-dose rate iridium-192 brachytherapy. A computed tomography-based 3-dimensional plan was created, and a dose of 34 Gy in 10 fractions was given twice daily, 6 hours apart, over 5 days. Follow-up examinations were performed 2 to 3 times annually by either a surgeon and/or a radiation oncologist. Annual mammograms were obtained. The patients included postmenopausal women with node-negative early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma with a tumor size < 3 cm (n = 93) or ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 18). Cosmesis was evaluated using the Harvard criteria, as excellent, good, fair, or poor. RESULTS: At a median follow-up period of 66 months (range, 1-139 months) after completing treatment, with a minimum of 5 years of follow-up data for 62 patients (55.9%), the incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) was 2.7% (n = 3) and the incidence of ipsilateral axilla nodal recurrence was 1.8% (n = 2). The ipsilateral breast preservation rate was 97.3%. The salvage mastectomy rate was 2.7% (n = 3), and the 5-year salvage mastectomy-free rate was 98.7% (95% confidence interval, 91.0%-99.8%). No distant failure developed, and no breast cancer-related deaths occurred. The 5-year overall survival rate was 91.7% (95% confidence interval, 83.2%-96.0%), and the 10-year breast cancer-specific survival rate was 100%. Of the 3 cases of IBTR, 2 were estrogen receptor negative (P = .076). The mean interval to IBTR was 78.7 +/- 27.5 months from treatment completion. A significant association was noted between African-American ethnicity and IBTR (P = .0398). Excellent to good cosmesis was observed in 98.1% of the patients. The maximum skin dose (mean value) for patients with excellent, good, and fair cosmesis was 302.2 Gy, 315.4 Gy, and 372.5 Gy (88.9%, 92.7%, and 109.5% of the prescription dose), respectively. The maximum skin dose was < 340 Gy (100% of the prescribed dose) in 69.9% of patients with excellent to good cosmesis. CONCLUSION: The long-term follow-up data of patients receiving APBI with a balloon device showed a low salvage mastectomy rate with durable long-term breast preservation. Excellent local control with good cosmesis was noted in these postmenopausal patients treated with APBI.",eng,0
Journal Article,A. Mannell,2005.0,Breast-conserving therapy in breast cancer patients--a 12-year experience,", ","INTRODUCTION: Twenty years ago prospective randomised controlled trials were initiated to compare conservative breast surgery plus radiation with radical mastectomy in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer. The results have shown no survival advantage for mastectomy over breast-conserving therapy (BCT). However, local recurrence of cancer after BCT has been reported to be as high as 14%, necessitating salvage mastectomy. METHODS: This retrospective study was performed on 165 breast cancer patients undergoing BCT in the 12 years up to August 2002. Resection and intraoperative cytological assessment were used to achieve clear excision margins. Adjuvant therapy (hormones, chemotherapy) was undertaken, and the incidence and times of local recurrence and distant metastases were recorded. RESULTS: Ninety-four per cent of patients had clear margins at the initial operation. This was achieved irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ alone or surrounding the cancer in 62% of cases. At a median follow-up of 65 months one patient developed local recurrence (LR) in the breast synchronously with distant relapse. Two patients had non-nodal axillary recurrences but no patient suffered LR in isolation in the treated breast. CONCLUSION: BCT is a safe alternative to mastectomy provided that the tumour is completely excised. The segment containing the cancer should be resected from the nipple to the periphery of the breast. Intraoperative cytological assessment helps to ensure clear margins. Reexcision is recommended for patients with close/involved margins.",eng,0
Journal Article,A. Mannell; B. Wium; C. Thatcher,2014.0,Intraoperative examination of sentinel lymph nodes using scrape cytology,10.7196/sajs.1954,"Background. In breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is widely used to assess the axilla when the nodes appear normal on palpation and ultrasonography. When the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are negative, no further dissection is required. Surgical dissection or radiotherapy of the axilla is indicated for macrometastases, as well as adjuvant therapy for macrometastases and micrometastasic spread.Aim. To determine the accuracy of scrape cytology (SC) for intraoperative examination of the SLNs.Methods. SLNB was performed in 100 patients with early breast cancer in whom the axillary nodes appeared normal on clinical examination and ultrasonography. None of the patients with negative SLNs or SLNs with micrometastases only (N1mic, 0.2 - 2 mm) had further axillary dissection. Patients with SLNs containing macrometastases (N1, &gt;2 mm) underwent axillary lymph node dissection. The results of intraoperative cytology were compared with the histopathological findings on examination of serial paraffin-embedded sections of the SLNs.Results. Intraoperative SC identified SLN metastases in 20 patients: 17 had macrometastases and 3 micrometastases. Histopathological examination of the SLNs found macrometastases in 18 patients and micrometastases in 6. SC had a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 100% for the detection of macrometastases. For micrometastatic spread, the sensitivity and specificity were 50% and 100%, respectively.Conclusion. SC is a rapid, sensitive technique for detection of macrometastases in the SLNs of women with breast cancer. The overall accuracy in identification of any metastatic spread (N1mic, N1) to the SLNs was 85%, rising to 94% in SLNs with macrometastases.",eng,0

Chandrashekar,2010.0,Dosimetry evaluation of SAVI-based HDR brachytherapy for partial breast irradiation,10.4103/0971-6203.62127,"Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy offers an excellent compact course of radiation due to its limited number of fractions for early-stage carcinoma of breast. One of the recent devices is SAVI (strut-adjusted volume implant), which has 6, 8 or 10 peripheral source channels with one center channel. Each channel can be differentially loaded. This paper focuses on the treatment planning, dosimetry and quality assurance aspects of HDR brachytherapy implant with GammaMed Plus HDR afterloader unit. The accelerated PBI balloon devices normally inflate above 35 cc range, and hence these balloon type devices cannot be accommodated in small lumpectomy cavity sizes. CT images were obtained and 3-D dosimetric plans were done with Brachyvision planning system. The 3-D treatment planning and dosimetric data were evaluated with planning target volume (PTV)_eval V90, V95, V150, V200 skin dose and minimum distance to skin. With the use of the SAVI 6-1 mini device, we were able to accomplish an excellent coverage - V90, V95, V150 and V200 to 98%, 95%, 37 cc (<50 cc volume) and 16 cc (<20 cc volume), respectively. Maximum skin dose was between 73% and 90%, much below the prescribed dose of 34 Gy. The minimum skin distance achieved was 5 to 11 mm. The volume that received 50% of the prescribed radiation dose was found to be lower with SAVI. The multi-channel SAVI-based implants reduced the maximum skin dose to markedly lower levels as compared to other modalities, simultaneously achieving best dose coverage to target volume. Differential-source dwell-loading allows modulation of the radiation dose distribution in symmetric or asymmetric opening of the catheter shapes and is also advantageous in cavities close to chest wall.",eng,0

The median follow-up was 40 months with a maximum follow-up of 152 months. METHODS: All patients had a wide local excision and lower lymph axillary node dissection followed by radiation therapy. The entire breast received an external beam dose of 4500 cGy at 180 cGy/5 days/week. An additional boost dose of 2000 cGy to the tumor bed was given at the time of lumpectomy (perioperative) with an Ir-192 implant or with electron beam therapy after the external beam therapy. RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year disease specific survival results were 97 and 90%, respectively for Stage I and 87 and 69% for patients with Stage II disease. The 5- and 10-year local control rates were 93 and 85% for Stage I and 92 and 87% for Stage II, respectively. The risk factors for local failure were premenopausal status and estrogen receptor-negative status at the univariate level but at the multivariate level the premenopausal and margins status were significant. CONCLUSION: These 10-year results were at least equivalent to reported series of similarly staged patients treated by mastectomy. This should encourage more surgeons to offer conservative treatment as an alternative to mastectomy to patients with Stage I and II breast cancer.",eng,0

Is it Indicated?,10.1007/s12253-013-9680-7,"Axillary sentinel node (A-SN) biopsy is a standard procedure in breast cancer surgery. Sampling of intenal mammary sentinel nodes (IM-SN) is not performed routinly, although it is also considered an important prognostic factor of breast cancer. The role of this latter procedure was investigated in cases of IM-SN visualized on lymphoscintigraphy. Between January 2001 and June 2012 1542 patients with clinically node negative operable primary breast cancer had sentinel node biopsy (SNB). Both axillary and IM-SN were sampled (whenever detected), based on lymphoscintigraphy, intraoperative gamma probe detection and blu dye mapping. Lymphoscintigraphy showed IM-SN in 83 cases. IM-SN biopsy (IM-SNB) was succesfull in 77 patients (93%). A total of 86 IM-SNs were removed. IM-SN involvement was identified in 14 cases, representing 18% of patients who underwent IM-SNB. This included macrometastases (MAC) in 5 cases, micrometastases (MIC) in 2 cases, isolated tumor cells (ITC) in 7 cases. No significant differences were found between patients with and without IM-SN involvement in terms of age, tumor location, tumor size, axillary involvement, tumor grade or estrogen receptor status. The IM-SN involvement has lead to new therapeutic indications in 2 cases (2.6%), both of them due to MAC in the IM-SN: in 1 case change in chemotherapy and in 1 case change in radiotherapy, with the addition of iradiation of the internal mammary chain. Based on this series and information from the literature, we conclude that the indication for an IM-SNB procedure is very limited and its routine use should not be recommended.",eng,0
Journal Article,V. A. Marcial,1990.0,Primary therapy for limited breast cancer. Radiation therapy techniques,", ","Available data show that breast conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy results in freedom of breast cancer recurrence rates that range from 86% at 10 years to 80% at 20 years for Stage I and II carcinoma. Breast cancer recurrence may be reduced further by the administration of systemic chemotherapy. Mastectomy and breast conserving therapy give equal tumor control and survival, but the latter results in superior quality of life. To achieve the best tumor control with optimal cosmesis, certain generally accepted principles of surgical and radiotherapeutic management need to be followed. The surgeon must use a neat technique that avoids excessive removal of breast and axillary tissue, improper placement of the surgical scar in the breast, and the formation of seromas or hematomas, which result in breast or arm edema. The radiation oncologist must use supervoltage energy, fields that avoid excessive irradiation of the lungs and other sensitive structures, proper field matching, whole breast doses ranging from 4500 to 5000 cGy with fractions of 180 to 200 cGy per day, and brachytherapy or electron beam boost to achieve a total dose of approximately 6000 cGy in the tumor area. These principles should result in good to excellent cosmesis in more than 80% of treated breasts. Breast conserving management offers women an incentive to achieve early detection. Early detection is the most promising approach to reduce mortality from breast cancer.",eng,0

The aim of partial Breast Irradiation (PBI) is to prevent, in a short period (5 to 8 days) and less transportations, the risk of local recurrence into the tumor bed. Different techniques have been described, using either interstitial brachytherapy (low or high dose rate) or intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT photons or electrons) or external beam radiation therapy. Phase II PBI trials using interstitial brachytherapy showed a local control rate of 0 to 4% with a follow-up of 20 to 75 months. The rate of good/excellent cosmetic results is 67 to 100%.

RESULTS: Increasing the photon energy (dose rate 0.2 Gy/min) from 50 kV (Intrabeam) to 380 keV ((1)(9)(2)Ir source) and 6 MV (linear accelerator) yielded an increase in the cell survival, whereas increasing the dose rate to 6 Gy/min had minor effect. Average RBE values for 50 kV with 6 MV as reference radiation varied from about 1.4 (for doses < 5 Gy) to > 1.9 (for doses < 0.02 Gy) for MCF-7 cells and from about 1.4 to > 3.1 for T-47D cells for the same dose levels. Corresponding RBE values for 380 keV radiation were about 1.4 for MCF-7 cells and 1.3-2.3 for T-47D cells. CONCLUSION: RBE data for breast cancer cells exposed to radiation used in IORT, brachytherapy or external radiation differ among the cell lines tested. The values are in agreement with published theoretical and experimental work.",eng,0

Partial breast irradiation (IORT or brachytherapy) differ from external radiation of whole breast in terms of irradiated volumes, fractionation, radiation energy and dose rate; all factors influencing the treatment outcome in a complex manner. Theoretically obtained RBE values comparing effects of radiation used in IORT and external therapy are published, but experimental studies are required to confirm these data. The aim of this study is to establish such RBE values for two breast cancer cell lines. Materials and methods. Colony formation of breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T-47D) were studied after photon irradiation with qualities and dose rates used in IORT, brachytherapy and external radiation.

These plates can be made of different materials, and the correct material (or combination of materials) has to be chosen in order to achieve the desired attenuation, while avoiding excessive backscattered radiation. The Monte Carlo method (BEAMnrcMP and DOSXYZnrcMP) has been used to characterize the electron beam generated by the setup (composed of a nondedicated linac and an applicator), and to simulate the percent depth dose (PDD) for plates of different materials. The beam has been characterized for nominal energies of 9 and 12 MeV. Several differently composed plates have been investigated: it was found, as expected, that the use of a plate presenting to the electron beam a high- Z material (i.e., lead) has to be avoided because of excessive backscatter (up to 52% compared to the PDD without plate). On the other hand, the use of a single low- Z material (i.e., aluminum) in the plate can lead to an insufficient attenuation of the beam. The two-layer plate (6 mm of Al plus 3 mm of Cu) used in S. Chiara Hospital has been found to attenuate the beam almost completely for both considered energies, causing negligible backscatter radiation. The spectrum at various depth and at the tissue-plate interface has also been investigated. © 2007 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",,0

Due to its toxicity, first-line combination chemotherapy is limited to patients with a good performance status (PS). Previously nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine has been demonstrated to improve the overall survival rate in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer with a good PS. The present study reports a case of a patient with metastatic PC with a poor PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 2) and a complex set of comorbidities treated with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine as a first-line palliative therapy. Adjusted doses of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine reached a favourable clinical, radiological and biochemical response in the present patient, which increased the quality of life for the patient. Eventually, the patient succumbed to acute cholangitis. Based on the results of the present study, nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine appears to be a favourable treatment as first-line palliative chemotherapy for patients with metastatic PC, comorbidities and poor PS.

Pignol,2016.0,Clinical Significance of Accounting for Tissue Heterogeneity in Permanent Breast Seed Implant Brachytherapy Planning,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.12.354,"PURPOSE: The inhomogeneity correction factor (ICF) method provides heterogeneity correction for the fast calculation TG43 formalism in seed brachytherapy. This study compared ICF-corrected plans to their standard TG43 counterparts, looking at their capacity to assess inadequate coverage and/or risk of any skin toxicities for patients who received permanent breast seed implant (PBSI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two-month postimplant computed tomography scans and plans of 140 PBSI patients were used to calculate dose distributions by using the TG43 and the ICF methods. Multiple dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters of clinical target volume (CTV) and skin were extracted and compared for both ICF and TG43 dose distributions. Short-term (desquamation and erythema) and long-term (telangiectasia) skin toxicity data were available on 125 and 110 of the patients, respectively, at the time of the study. The predictive value of each DVH parameter of skin was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each toxicity endpoint. RESULTS: Dose-volume histogram parameters of CTV, calculated using the ICF method, showed an overall decrease compared to TG43, whereas those of skin showed an increase, confirming previously reported findings of the impact of heterogeneity with low-energy sources. The ICF methodology enabled us to distinguish patients for whom the CTV V100 and V90 are up to 19% lower compared to TG43, which could present a risk of recurrence not detected when heterogeneity are not accounted for. The ICF method also led to an increase in the prediction of desquamation, erythema, and telangiectasia for 91% of skin DVH parameters studied. CONCLUSIONS: The ICF methodology has the advantage of distinguishing any inadequate dose coverage of CTV due to breast heterogeneity, which can be missed by TG43. Use of ICF correction also led to an increase in prediction accuracy of skin toxicities in most cases.",eng,0

During the past 5 years, multidetector-row computed tomography has demonstrated excellent results in preoperative planning of abdominal free flap breast reconstruction, significantly reducing operative time and complications. The main drawbacks of computed tomography are unnecessary radiation to the patient and possible allergic reactions to intravenous contrast material. To circumvent these limitations, we performed noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging for abdominal perforator mapping. The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of this technique in preoperative planning of breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flaps. From October 2007 to February 2009, noncontrast magnetic resonance preoperative mapping was performed in 56 female patients who underwent breast reconstruction after mastectomy with deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flaps. Imaging results were compared with the intraoperative clinical findings in all patients. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging without the contrast showed no false-positive or false-negative results. In all cases, the perforator chosen as dominant according to magnetic resonance images corresponded with the perforator chosen intraoperatively (100% predictive value). Preoperative imaging techniques make perforator flap surgery safer for the patient. Noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging provides reliable information on the vascular anatomy of the abdominal wall, facilitating selection of the most appropriate deep inferior epigastric artery dominant perforator. It avoids radiation to the patient and also the need for intravenous contrast medium as required for the multidetector-row computed tomography. In our opinion, noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging is an ideal method for preoperative planning of breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flaps.",eng,0

A comparative analysis was performed among 3 groups of patients undergoing oncoplastic techniques plus external radiation therapy or intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and breast conservative surgery plus external radiation therapy; long-term oncologic results in terms of disease relapse and aesthetic outcomes were compared. METHODS: Ninety-six patients were considered: 32 patients treated with oncoplastic surgery, 16 then subjected to radiotherapy (group 1) and another 16 treated with IORT (group 2); 64 patients treated by conservative surgery and radiotherapy formed the control group (group 3). Patients were asked to give a judgment on the cosmetic result considering the following parameters: breast symmetry, appearance of the residual scar, symmetry between the 2 nipple-areola complexes, global aesthetic judgment, and satisfaction about the result. RESULTS: With respect to the oncological and aesthetic outcome, the statistical significance of the results obtained in the 3 groups was calculated using the chi-square test. The results, processed by the chi-square test, were not statistically significant; however, the overall judgments expressed by the patients of all 3 groups were more than satisfactory (scores greater than or equal to 6). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, when the inclusion criteria are satisfied and the equipment is available, oncoplastic techniques associated with IORT should be considered the treatment of choice for breast cancer in early stage. The excellent cosmetic results and patient's satisfaction encourage us to continue on this way.",eng,0

Methods: Women 80 years of age and older who underwent operation for ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer from 2005 to 2010 and who had at least 6 months of follow-up were identified from a single-institution, prospectively maintained, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant database. Patients with mammographic, other imaging, or palpable abnormalities were identified, and the results of their imaging studies and biopsies were reviewed. Number of locoregional recurrences, contralateral cancers, and benign biopsies were determined. Follow-up and survival data were recorded. Results: Overall, 429 women with a mean age of 83.4 years were included. Mean follow-up was 50.0 months (range 6-113). Patients had a median of four follow-up mammograms (range 0-11). The 1466 mammograms detected 17 biopsy-proven cancers and generated 18 benign biopsies. In the 305 women who had had breast-conserving surgery, 18 (5.9 %) experienced local recurrence, 9 detected by mammography alone (mean size 1.2 cm) and 9 palpable (mean size 2.0 cm). Contralateral cancer developed in 4 (0.9 %) of the 429 patients, all detected on screening mammogram alone. Conclusion: Overall, 13 non-palpable breast cancers were detected in 1466 mammograms (0.9 %). While these results are acceptable for screening programs in healthy populations, further study of the need for routine follow-up imaging in the elderly, and the appropriate interval, is needed to maximize resource utilization.

Journal Article,B. D. Matthews; G. B. Williams,1999.0,Initial experience with the advanced breast biopsy instrumentation system,", ","BACKGROUND: Advanced breast biopsy instrumentation is a recently designed alternative to large-core stereotactic and open needle localized breast biopsies. This minimally invasive technique uses digital stereotactic imaging to perform excisional biopsies of suspicious, nonpalpable mammographic lesions. The role of the ABBI system in the management of breast cancer has not yet been defined. METHODS: A retrospective review to evaluate the safety, accuracy, and cost effectiveness of the ABBI system as performed by a single surgeon on 107 patients from February 1, 1997 to January 31, 1998. We also discuss the use of the ABBI system as a therapeutic breast cancer technique. All patients had nonpalpable mammographic lesions. The mammographic abnormalities were either architectural distortion, microcalcifications, or stellate and nodular densities. RESULTS: Using the ABBI stereotactic unit, 110 breast biopsies were performed in 107 patients during a 12-month period. The mammographic abnormality was accurately localized and successfully biopsied in 99% (109 of 110) of the procedures as confirmed by specimen radiographs, stereotactic images, permanent pathologic sections, and 6-month follow-up mammograms. There were no intraoperative complications. Two patients developed postoperative wound hematomas and there was 1 postoperative wound infection. Six in situ cancers and 21 invasive cancers were diagnosed with the ABBI system. Two additional invasive cancers were diagnosed in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ at reexcision. Four patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and 1 patient with ductal carcinoma in situ had negative margins on their stereotactic biopsies and did not undergo reexcision by lumpectomy or mastectomy. Each of the 4 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma underwent axillary node dissections with postoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy or tamoxifen. During the study period, the average hospital patient charge for a stereotactic breast biopsy was $2,377.75, and for an open excisional needle localized biopsy it was $3,028.00 (P <0.05). The stereotactic breast biopsy offered a total cost savings of $71,527.50 in our series of patients. CONCLUSION: Advanced breast biopsy instrumentation is a safe, accurate, and cost-effective method for performing breast biopsies. In addition, the ABBI system may be able to excise small in situ or invasive breast cancers.",eng,0

Friebe,2013.0,Combination of intra-operative freehand SPECT imaging with MR images for guidance and navigation,10.1109/embc.2013.6610267,"Nowadays for clinical applications such as sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast or prostate cancer, only pre-operative image data is used for navigation, i.e. CT, SPECT/CT or PET/CT. Freehand SPECT and freehand PET provide intra-operative functional imaging techniques that can be complemented with pre- and intra-operative MR imaging to allow for better planning, navigation and guidance. In this paper we propose a method to enable navigation based on pre- or intra-operatively acquired MR images. A fully MR compatible phantom and a dedicated MR compatible optical tracking target with MR markers is built for this study. PET/MR, SPECT/CT and freehand SPECT scans of the phantom are performed. Registration is done using point based registration of the known marker and target geometries and a ground truth is obtained from a SPECT/CT and an MR image that are directly registered. The RMS errors was 0.31 mm for the ground truth and 3.29 mm when using segmentation of the MR markers and their spatial relationship with the optical tracking spheres of the dedicated target. Thus, the freehand SPECT can be registered easily by this approach without the need of any additional CT scans and therefore without any additional radiation dose for the patient. This enables intra-operative fusion of the pre- or intra-operatively acquired MR data, which could provide valuable additional information for intra-operative applications such as guidance based on accurate anatomy or verifying exact tumor location in combination with detailed morphological patient data.",eng,0

The breast and regional nodes received 45 Gy of 60Co irradiation in 25 fractions over 5 weeks (45 Gy/25/5 wks). Electrons were used to deliver a further 15 Gy/7/1.5 weeks to the internal mammary chain and 25 Gy/11/2.5 weeks to the lower axilla. The primary tumor was boosted by Iridium 192 implant for a further 37 Gy prescribed at 85% of the basal dose rate (Paris system). Rigid needles were secured by templates in single plane (58/398) or double plane (340/398) geometry. Results of the 340 two-plane implants have been analyzed to look for a possible influence of dose rate on local control. Follow-up for patients free of local recurrence is 4-204 months (median: 92 months). The 340 tumors were divided into three groups according to dose rate: 0.32-0.49 Gy/hr (n = 95), 0.50-0.59 Gy/hr (n = 120), and 0.60-0.90 Gy/hr (n = 125).

At 15 years the estimated local control (Kaplan Meier) is 60%, 72%, and 84% (p less than 0.02, Logrank), respectively. This analysis indicates that there is a significant effect of dose rate on local control for carcinoma of the breast treated by combined external beam (45 Gy) plus Iridium 192 implantation (37 Gy).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between March 2001 and June 2006, 322 consecutive patients were treated with high-dose-rate (HDR) APBI at the University of Wisconsin. A total of 136 patients were identified who met the ASTRO cautionary criteria. Thirty-eight (27.9%) patients possessed multiple cautionary factors. All patients received 32 to 34 Gy in 8 to 10 twice-daily fractions using multicatheter (93.4%) or Mammosite balloon (6.6%) brachytherapy. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 60 months, there were 5 ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTR), three local, and two loco-regional. The 5-year actuarial rate of IBTR was 4.8%+/-4.1%. The 5-year disease-free survival was 89.6%, with a cause-specific survival and overall survival of 97.6% and 95.3%, respectively. There were no IBTRs among 32 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) vs. 6.1% for patients with invasive carcinoma (p=0.24). Among 104 patients with Stage I or II invasive carcinoma, the IBTR rate for patients considered cautionary because of age alone was 0% vs. 12.7% in those deemed cautionary due to histopathologic factors (p=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we observed few local recurrences among patients with cautionary features. Women with DCIS and patients 50 to 59 years of age with Stage I/II disease who otherwise meet the criteria for suitability appear to be at a low risk of IBTR. Patients with tumor-related cautionary features will benefit from careful patient selection.",eng,0

Methods and Materials: 44 patients were enrolled between April 2007 and March 2008, and 13 patients have completed 6 months of follow up to date. Patients were eligible if they were older than 50 years, had completely resected DCIS (<2.0cm) or invasive ductal carcinoma (<2.0cm), and microscopic surgical margins of at least 1mm. The balloon applicator was placed in a closed cavity and a balloon surface to skin distance of at least 7mm was required for treatment. The radiation treatment (RT) consisted of delivering 3.4 Gy/fraction twice a day for 10 total fractions. The primary endpoint was the successful delivery of the prescribed RT. Secondary endpoint was adverse device related events. Results: Thirteen of the forty-four patients that were enrolled and treated on this study have been followed a minimum of 6 months. The three month follow-up included cosmesis evaluation using the Harvard Cosmesis Scale, and adverse events. The three month cosmesis evaluated by physicians' showed 100% of the patients rated with excellent to good cosmesis. Related adverse events reported through three months included a total of fifteen CTC v3 Grade One AEs. Events included erythema, itching, induration, skin firmness, rash/desquamation, fatigue. Of these events 90% were resolved. The six month cosmesis physician evaluations showed 82% of the patients had excellent to good cosmesis. Twelve of the 13 patients rated the appearance of their breast, in addition to the physician assessment, and 12 out of 12 rated their appearance good to excellent, one patient did not select any rating. Adverse events reported at six months were a total of three new CTC v3 Grade One. These AEs included occurrences of induration, skin firmness, and hyperpigmentation. A patient satisfaction survey at 6 months follow-up was completed by the patients. Certain survey questions required an answer using a scale of 0-6 for the ratings, where six was the best score. The patients' mean overall rating of satisfaction with the study participation was 5.55 out of 6 (min 3, max 6), satisfied with the radiation treatment was rated 5.54 out of 6 (min 3, max 6). All 13 patients, 100%, stated they would recommend this treatment to a friend. Conclusion: This report provides an early look at the experience of using electronic brachytherapy as a means for intracavitary partial breast radiotherapy. The first cohort has reached a minimum of 6 months of follow up and the results appear promising. Additional patient follow up will be presented at the meeting.",,0

Journal Article,I. Melnik; I. Lifshitz; P. Weinshtein; B. Yoffe,2014.0,[Intraoperative margin evaluation in breast-conservation surgery using margin probe technique],", ","BACKGROUND: The most important prognostic factor after breast conservation surgery is surgical margin involvement. In cases where surgical margins are involved, the patient must return to the OR for a second operation. Therefore, there is a need for an intra-operative tool to assess the surgical margins. The Margin Probe technique was developed for this need. In this article we present our experience at the Barzilai"" Medical Center using the Margin Probe during breast conservation surgery. METHODS: The Margin Probe technique is added to routine standard of care at ""Barzilai"" Medical Center. The device sends radiofrequency signals to the resected tissue and spectroscopy analysis provides data to the surgeon about the involvement of the surgical margins. In cases where the device signals for positive margins, the surgeon expands the resection, in order to avoid a second surgery in the future. RESULTS: From sixty four patients who underwent breast conservative surgery, twenty four (37.5%) underwent intraoperative additional re-excision due to positive margin signals from the Margin Probe device. From those patients, nine patients (37.5%) indeed had surgical margins involvement in the pathology analysis. From all patients, four (6.25%) underwent a second surgery, while only one patient had a false negative measurement from the device. CONCLUSIONS: According to our experience, using the Margin Probe technique is feasible, safe and reduces the rate of repeated operation.""",heb,0

Tersigni,2010.0,[Ultraconservative treatment in stage I and II breast carcinoma. Results of a long-term follow-up on 500 operated breasts],", ","AIM: Several randomized trials on conservative surgery compared with mastectomy in early-stage breast cancer have validated this technique in terms of local and distant relapse and survival of patients. Standard conservative approach includes surgical removal of the cancer with adequate cancer-free margins, axillary dissection, postoperative breast irradiation and adjuvant treatments when required. METHODS: From 1987 to 2003, 500 early stage breast carcinoma were treated on 494 patients with conservative surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Surgery consisted in a wide tumorectomy, with intraoperative control of R0 margins. The total postoperative radiation dosage was 50 Gy on the whole breast, associated with a boost of 10 Gy on tumor bed (20 Gy in T2 neoplasms). Before 1997 node-positive patients were treated with axillary irradiation with 50 Gy. Postoperative chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy were administered to patients according with node-involvement, age and menopausal status. AJCC-stage was T1N0 in 44%, T2N0 in 15%, T1N1 in 19% and T2N1 in 22% of the patients. RESULTS: In a postoperative setting, we observed 9% of axillary seromas or hematomas and 7% of oedema of the arm. At a median follow-up of 150 months (range 48-248 months), actuarial local recurrence rates were 7% at 5 years and 14% at 10 years. The actuarial rates of distant metastases were 18% at 5 years and 33% at 10 years. Ten-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 81% and 60%, respectively. Cosmetic results were good/excellent in 80%, satisfactory in 10% and poor in 10% of patients. CONCLUSION: Recurrence and survival rates in breast-conserving surgery are consistent with indexed literature on conservative treatment of early breast cancer. Women eligible for conservative treatment should be offered the choice of either wide tumorectomy or quadrantectomy with axillary lymph nodes removal and postoperative radiotherapy, or modified radical mastectomy.",ita,0

Pignol,2014.0,Measurement of mean cardiac dose for various breast irradiation techniques and corresponding risk of major cardiovascular event,10.3389/fonc.2014.00284,"After breast conserving surgery, early stage breast cancer patients are currently treated with a wide range of radiation techniques including whole breast irradiation (WBI), accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, or 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). This study compares the mean heart's doses for a left breast irradiated with different breast techniques. An anthropomorphic Rando phantom was modified with gelatin-based breast of different sizes and tumors located medially or laterally. The breasts were treated with WBI, 3D-CRT, or HDR APBI. The heart's mean doses were measured with Gafchromic films and controlled with optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters. Following the model reported by Darby (1), major cardiac were estimated assuming a linear risk increase with the mean dose to the heart of 7.4% per gray. WBI lead to the highest mean heart dose (2.99 Gy) compared to 3D-CRT APBI (0.51 Gy), multicatheter (1.58 Gy), and balloon HDR (2.17 Gy) for a medially located tumor. This translated into long-term coronary event increases of 22, 3.8, 11.7, and 16% respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed that the tumor location had almost no effect on the mean heart dose for 3D-CRT APBI and a minimal impact for HDR APBI. In case of WBI large breast size and set-up errors lead to sharp increases of the mean heart dose. Its value reached 10.79 Gy for women with large breast and a set-up error of 1.5 cm. Such a high value could increase the risk of having long-term coronary events by 80%. Comparison among different irradiation techniques demonstrates that 3D-CRT APBI appears to be the safest one with less probability of having cardiovascular events in the future. A sensitivity analysis showed that WBI is the most challenging technique for patients with large breasts or when significant set-up errors are anticipated. In those cases, additional heart shielding techniques are required.",eng,0

Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is a typical example of a neoplasm for which it has been challenging to find effective advances in treatment. The survival time of patients who have this disease is limited to 9 to 12 months (median), with a 2-year survival rate of 10% to 20% following even the most effective chemoradiation. It is perhaps overly optimistic to expect that IORT will significantly enhance survival, because currently available systemic treatment options have not meaningfully affected either overall patient survival times or the rate of distant metastasis in either the adjuvant setting or for metastatic disease. It is encouraging, however, that Willett has reported five patients with 5-year survival times in the Massachusetts General Hospital IOERT series for unresectable pancreatic cancer (C.G. Willett, personal communication, 2002). Also encouraging is the report from the Medical College of Ohio of a 5-year rate of 33% in a small group of patients with resectable pancreatic cancers treated with single IORT doses (without EBRT or chemotherapy) as the sole adjuvant to surgical resection. At the same institution, during the same time period, the same group of surgeons observed that no patient with resectable pancreatic cancer survived longer than 13 months following surgical resection alone [7]. Exciting possibilities involve the use of IORT when treating early-stage malignant disease, as is detailed in the chapter on breast cancer. The use of [table: see text] IORT as adjuvant therapy seems to be associated with an extremely low incidence of in-breast local recurrence. Whether this is because of early stage of the disease or the adjuvant EBRT is not entirely clear at the time of this writing. (The results of ongoing randomized studies may not be powered sufficiently to resolve the question.) Because the local recurrence rate currently is extremely low (only one reported recurrence), however, this finding is promising. Also exciting is the use of IORT as the sole radiation [table: see text] treatment following limited excision of breast cancer. The results of the Lanciano and Milano trials (see chapter 12) are awaited with great interest. Equally exciting is the finding of meaningful survival of 20% to 40% of patients who have local or regionally recurrent cancers when IORT is used as a component of treatment together with EBRT, maximal resection, and chemotherapy, as indicated.

Group I was composed of 69% ductal, 22% lobular and 9% tubular carcinomas, and group II of 87% ductal, 10% lobular and 3% tubular carcinomas. Seven and 5 radiologically unifocal tumors were in fact with multiple invasive foci at histology in groups I and II respectively. The complete scintigraphic procedure permitted the detection of a mean number of 2.7 (1-7) SN in group I and 2.3 (1-4) in group II (NS). In group I, the SN were metastatic in 22 patients (48%), 15 of them with the metastases being restricted to the SN, whereas in group II, the SN were metastatic in 9 patients (28%), 5 of them with the positivity restricted to the SN. No false negative result (SN negative and other axillary nodes positive) was observed in group I and only one false negative result in group II which was related to a cancer with histological multiple invasive foci. Sensitivities were 100% and 90%, and negative predictive values were 100% and 95%, for groups I and II respectively. Subareolar injection of radiocolloid allows identification of SN in cases of unifocal and multiple cancer. The mean number of SN detected by the subareolar method is not significantly different, although higher, to that detected by peritumoral injection.",fre,0
Journal Article,M. Meyns; N. Jansen; J. M. Deneufbourg,2006.0,[Place of radiation-therapy of breast cancer treatment--current and future indications],", ","Radiotherapy is an important part of breast cancer treatment. After breast conserving surgery, a dose of 50 Grays (Gy) is administered to the entire breast. Boost by external radiotherapy or brachytherapy improves local control especially for women under fifty. For lobular in situ lesions, no additional treatment is required, while intraductal lesions are treated with post-operative radiotherapy in case of Van Nuys score of 7, 8 or 9. After mastectomy, irradiation is proposed in case of skin involvement, invasion of pectoral muscle, positivity of at least 3 axillary lymph nodes, SBR III grade, T3 stage or multifocality where the sum of tumour diameters are >5 cm. Irradiation of the axilla has become exceptional. In node positive patients, the supraclavicular region receives 50 Gy with low energy photons, whereas the internal mammary chain is treated at the same dose but half is administered by low energy photons et half by electrons. Exclusive or preoperative irradiation is rare, because of new chemotherapy schedules, new drugs and hormonotherapy developments. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy enhances possibilities of conservative surgery it is followed by radiotherapy depending on the same indiciations listed above. Re-irradiation is possible but one must be aware of the higher risk of late toxicity. Nowadays, major side-effects are rare but close follow-up during and after treatment is required from the radiation oncologist to detect, evaluate, prevent and even treat possible complications.",fre,0

This study considers the amount of radiation delivered to the patient, outlining how scan parameters can be optimized to minimize the radiation exposure whilst maintaining image quality. Results of scan parameters and dose reports for 34 patients undergoing abdominal wall CTA are compared with those patients undergoing routine abdominal computed tomography. The links between computed tomography dose quantities are explained, including their conversion to effective dose (in mSv) and risk as the probability for inducing deterministic effects (eg, skin burns) and stochastic effects (ie, cancer induction). The mean effective dose by using our technique for routine abdominal computed tomography is 9.9 and for abdominal wall CTA is 6.0 mSv. All doses are far below the thresholds for deterministic effects to the skin. Abdominal wall CTA can be justified before major reconstructive surgery if the surgeon believes that the very low estimated risk of fatal radiation-induced cancer (1 in 4270 for 6 mSv) is outweighed by the benefits.",eng,0

Material and Methods: The treatment protocol was approved by Ethical Committee. The BCT using combined SNB, wide local excision (WLE) and IORT was performed in 138 patients who signed the informed consent. Patients with primary tumour <2 cm and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes were eligible. The SNB was done using isotope-dye technique with preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. The INTRABEAM PRS 500 system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, G) was used for irradiation of the tumour bed with the dose of 20 Gy (boost; energy 18keV). After completion of the adjuvant treatment, whole breast external beam irradiation was performed with a total dose of 50 Gy, omitting the tumour bed. Objective computerized aesthetic effect assessment was done using BCCT.core software (University of Porto, PT). Follow-up time ranged from 9 to 38 months (mean 22 months). Results: Minor early postoperative complications (reddening of the skin wound; seroma) did not prolong hospitalization. In 14 patients (10%), surgical specimen pathology revealed positive margin. Re-excision of the margins was performed all in of these patients. In one patient mastectomy was necessary because neoplastic cells in re-excison specimen. In 27 (20%) patients (selective) lymphadenectomy was performed following positive SNB. In one patient both positive SNB and positive margins necessitated mastectomy; whereas in another patient after selective lymphadenectomy, mastectomy was necessary because of margins' infiltration by comedo type carcinoma. Altogether breast and axillary lymph node preservation was possible in 108 (78%) of patients. Fifteen patients (11%) had fibrosis of the treated breast quadrant. In patients after breast conservation who reached 1 year follow-up, the BCCT.core general aesthetic score was excellent in 52%, good in 42%, and fair in 6% of patients. There was neither poor aesthetic outcome. In one patient pulmonary metastases were detected prior to local recurrence in the breast. Conclusions: The combination of SNB, WLE and IORT is a safe surgical procedure leading both to breast and axillary lymph nodes preservation with improved patients' satisfaction by excellent or good aesthetic effect and shortening the time of treatment in majority of patients.",,0

The main goal of IOERT is to counteract tumor growth by acting on residual cancer cells as well as to preserve healthy surrounding tissue from the side-effects of radiation therapy. The radiobiology of the healthy tissue response to IR is a topic of interest which may contribute to avoiding impairment of normal tissue and organ function and to reducing the risks of secondary cancer. The purpose of the study was to highlight cell and gene expression responses following IOERT treatment in the human nontumorigenic MCF10A cell line in order to find new potential biomarkers of radiosensitivity/radioresistance. Material and Methods: Gene-expression profiling of MCF10A cells treated with 9 and 23 Gy doses (IOERT boost and exclusive treatment, respectively), was performed by whole-genome cDNA microarrays. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence and immunoblot experiments were carried out to validate candidate IOERT biomarkers. Clonogenic tests and morphological evaluations to examine cellular effects induced by radiation were also conducted. Results: The study revealed a dose-dependent gene-expression profile and specific key genes that may be proposed as novel markers of radiosensitivity. Our results show consistent differences in non-tumorigenic cell tolerance and in the molecular response of MCF10A cells to different IOERTs. In particular, after 9 Gy of exposure, the selection of a radioresistant cell fraction was observed. Conclusion: The possibility of clarifying the molecular strategies adopted by cells in choosing between death or survival after IR-induced damage opens-up new avenues for the selection of a proper personalized therapy schedule.

In APBI, the tumor bed is topically irradiated over a short period after breast-conserving surgery. The fundamental concept underlying APBI is that more than 70% of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence occurs in the neighborhood of the original tumor, and that hypofractionated radiotherapy can be applied safely when the irradiated volume is small enough. It is expected to reduce the time and cost required for conventional whole breast irradiation while maintaining equivalent local control. Several techniques including multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy, intraoperative radiation therapy, and 3D conformal external beam radiation therapy have been proposed, and each of them has its own advantages and drawbacks. Although APBI is increasingly used in the United States and Europe, and the short-term results are promising, its equivalence with whole breast radiation therapy is not fully established. In addition, because the average breast size in Japan is considerably smaller than in the West world, the application of APBI to Japanese patients is technically more challenging. At this point, APBI is still an investigational treatment in Japan, and the optimal method of radiation delivery as well as its long-term efficacy and safety should be clarified in clinical trials.",,0

It has now become the standard part of the breast conserving procedure, as well as in patients who underwent mastectomy with T3 and/or 4 or more positive nodes in axilla. In treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ, postoperative RT after lumpectomy is almost always required, because it reduces ipsilateral invasive and DCIS recurrence by approximately 50-60%. For invasive breast cancer RT decreases the locoregional relapse rate by 70%. The indication for postoperative RT and the definition of the target volumes depend on the prognostic factors and surgical procedures. The overview by the Early Breast cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) demonstrates for the first time, that postoperative RT is not only important in achieving loco-regional control, but also has significant influence on long-term survival. This benefit of postoperative RT is achieved by proper indication of RT and more importantly by using modern RT techniques that can avoid the serious late side-effects. © 2011 by Acta Medica Saliniana.",,0

The authors also investigated the perimeter radiation levels during three different clinical intraoperative treatments (breast, floor of the mouth and bilateral neck cancer patients). Radiation surveys during treatment delivery indicated that IORT using the surface applicator and IORT using balloons inserted into patient body give rise to exposure rates of 200 mR h(-1), 30 cm from a treated area. To reduce the exposure levels, movable lead shields should be used as they reduce the exposure rates by >95%.

Since the advent of perforator flaps their use in microsurgical breast reconstruction has grown. Perforator based flaps afford lower donor morbidity by sparing the underlying muscle provide durable results, superior cosmesis to create a natural looking new breast, and are preferred in the context of radiation therapy. However these surgeries are complex; more technically challenging that implant based reconstruction, and leaves little room for error. The role of imaging in breast reconstruction can assist the surgeon in exploring or confirming flap choices based on donor site characteristics and presence of suitable perforators. Vascular anatomical studies in the lab have provided the surgeon a foundation of knowledge on location and vascular territories of individual perforators to improve our understanding for flap design and safe flap harvest. The creation of a presurgical map in patients can highlight any abnormal or individual anatomical variance to optimize flap design, intraoperative decision-making and execution of flap harvest with greater predictability and efficiency. This article highlights the role and techniques for preoperative planning using the newer technologies that have been adopted in reconstructive clinical practice: computed tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), laser-assisted indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (LA-ICGFA) and dynamic infrared thermography (DIRT).

All flaps survived, and there were no cases of intraoperative congestion. The average time required to perform the additional retrograde anastomosis was 12 minutes. Flow of indocyanine green not only revealed patency of our anastomoses but it confirmed unobstructed flow through the retrograde limb of the IMV. Our study further validates that the retrograde limb of the IMV does in fact achieve flow away from the DIEP flap and can therefore be used as an additional or alternative outflow tract in DIEP flap breast reconstruction surgery.",eng,0

The commercially available in vivo dosimetry technologies allow either a real time measurement in one point (MOSFET type detectors) or a non real time measurement over a surface (radio chromic films). A cooperation between ASMN Reggio Emilia, INFN and SIT has led to the conceptual design of a new device capable of satisfying the above mentioned needs. Such device has been patented (Italian Patent # TO2014A000943). The new dosimeter consists in four leaf shaped plastic scintillators positioned between the two parts of the radiation protection disc. Such device can measure in real time the dose in the four sectors, providing both the integral dose and a measurement of the field symmetry on the target. Materials and Methods: The accelerator employed is LIAC S/N 010, a mobile IORT dedicated electron accelerator capable of producing a 4, 6, 8 and 10 MeV electron beam, produced by SIT. Measurements have been performed with a prototype based on a plastic scintillator tile placed in a PMMA phantom; plastic scintillator data has been compared with the standard dose measurements, performed by means of the PTW Roos ionization chamber. Results: The behavior of the plastic scintillator has been tested with the IORT accelerator electron beam and the system fully complies with the standards requirements. Conclusions: The above described in vivo dosimeter significantly improves the IORT clinical documentation, allowing the real time check of the dose delivery over the whole PTV. Furthermore, since the device sensitivity is high enough to produce a precise dose map with an overall delivery of less than 1 cGy, the correct positioning of the disc with respect to the PTV and the applicator can be checked before delivering the treatment, allowing the surgeon to correct it should the symmetry on the PTV be out of tolerance levels.",,0

We have developed robust plan evaluation criteria specifically for the strut-adjusted volume implant (SAVI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Plan evaluation criteria were established using a training data set"" of 62 SAVI treatment plans and included the percentage volume of target receiving 90%, 95%, and 100% of the prescription dose (V90, V95, and V100), the absolute volume of target receiving 150% and 200% of prescription (V150 and V200), and the maximum doses to skin (Dskin max) and ribs (Drib max). ""Ideal"" and ""expected"" (routinely achievable) thresholds were determined for each criterion and compared to B-39 guidelines. A ""test data set"" collected from the next 25 patients was analyzed using the developed plan evaluation criteria. RESULTS: Ideal (expected) dosimetric thresholds established from the training data set were V90 >/= 98% (95%), V95 >/= 95% (92%), V100 >/= 91% (88%), Dskin max < 90% (100%), and Drib max < 100%. Thresholds for V150 and V200 were stratified by SAVI size: V150 </= 30 cc (50 cc) and V200 </= 15 cc (20 cc) for 6-1 and Mini; V150 </= 50 cc (50 cc) and V200 </= 20 cc (20 cc) for 8-1 and 10-1. There was no significant difference between the training and test data sets in the fractions of patients meeting the criteria. Overall, 58% and 95% of 87 plans met all ideal and all expected criteria, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The plan evaluation criteria developed specifically for the SAVI device are robust, providing increased target coverage and increased skin sparing compared to B-39 guidelines.""",eng,0

Morgan,1998.0,"A synopsis of radiation oncology in Australia, with particular reference to New South Wales",", ","The specialty of radiation oncology had its beginning in Australia in 1896 following the discovery of X-rays by Roentgen. The new technology was eagerly embraced and the use of X-rays and radium for the treatment of cancer, even in the early 1900s, produced results which, although far from satisfactory by today's standards, resulted in cure and palliation of more superficial tumours. In the era immediately prior to World War II the specialty was regarded as having only a limited role to play in cancer management. The introduction of cobalt-60 units and linear accelerators in the 1950s allowed for treatment of deep-seated tumours without the skin, bone and other complications of orthovoltage machines (deep X-rays). But the introduction of radiotherapy treatment into cancer care was blocked by other specialties anxious to preserve their own 'turf and by medical administrators who believed the counter-claims that either cancer was incurable or 'the cure for cancer was just around the comer' and it was therefore foolish to waste money on an expensive technology that had a limited future. With further developments in technology, modern radiotherapy is now a highly sophisticated treatment using sharply focused and deeply penetrating X-rays and electron beams. Specialized treatments, such as automated afterloading brachytherapy, total body irradiation, stereotactic radiosurgery and computerized 3-D planning to improve dose distribution, are now widely available. The outcomes of cancer patients with radiotherapy have also improved considerably and organ preservation (e.g. in breast and larynx cancer) has resulted in improved quality of life. However, the specialty has only recently begun to expand in specialist numbers and profile. This is partly due to the lack of undergraduate training in cancer in general and radiotherapy in particular and also because understaffing has meant that radiation oncologists have occupied a purely service role (in the basement with their machines) rather than being an active part of the treatment 'team'. As a consequence radiation oncology has not been projected as an important component in cancer management and as a challenging and fulfilling career option to medical students and new graduates. The failure to act on the (repeated) recommendations of the 42 reports, inquiries, etc. into radiation oncology in Australia since 1982 (in addition to many more at local level) would suggest that the 'message' has yet to be accepted by Health Departments and health administrators. As a result there has been a totally uncoordinated approach to provision of radiation oncology services. The restriction of services and specialist numbers and training posts has led to radiotherapy being underutilized and undervalued in the treatment of cancer, ultimately to the detriment of cancer patients.",eng,0

IOERT is a therapeutic variety of selective overimpression on tumoral volumes or area at relapse risk. That allows to protect the adjacent healthy tissues. AIMS Assessment of toxicity and survival of IOERT in exclusive treatment or overimpression of primary tumors and relapse. Materials and methods. Retrospective study carried out between February 2008 and January 2013 in 67 patients who were administered IOERT as part of multidisciplinay treatment. 61.2% were women and 38.8% men. The median age was 65 years (range 31-91). The classification according to the localization was: 32.8% breast, 38.8% colon-rectal, limb 13.5%, gynaecological 3% and pancreas 4.5%. 56.7% were administered RIO as primary treatment, 7 as overimpression (9 Gy) and 13 as exclusive (21 Gy). 83.6% showed R0 after surgery. The most frequently applicator was 6cm (34.4%) and the electron energy 4-15MeV. The dose varies according to the intention (9-21 Gy) and the surgical margin. 25.4% were administered later external radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment (median 44 Gy). Result. With a follow up of 60 month, the current overall survival is 77.6%. The disease free survival (DFS) and metastasis (DFM) is 80.6% and 85.1% respectively. The current local control is 91% with a trend towards significance between primary and relapse (p = 0.074). Of the patients with relapse after treatment, 60% received chemotherapy with progression criteria in 60%. Five of those patients (50%) died due to surgical complications. The maximum acute toxicity was GIII: dermatitis 1.5%, genitourinary 4.5% and moderate limitation in mobility was 3%. Two patients presented neuropathic pain GIII with improvement one month after treatment end. No later complications have been assessed because of the short monitoring period. Conclusions. The use of IOERT, either as a relapse or primary treatment provides an increase in the local control. It minimizes the duration and toxicity of treatment.",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatment plans and postimplant computed tomography scans for 20 PBSI patients were spatially registered and used to evaluate differences between planned and implanted seed positions, termed seed displacements. For each patient, the mean total and directional seed displacements were determined in both standard room coordinates and in needle coordinates relative to needle insertion angle. Seeds were labeled according to their proximity to the anatomy within the breast, to evaluate the influence of anatomic regions on seed placement. Dosimetry within an evaluative target volume (seroma + 5 mm), skin, breast, and ribs was evaluated to determine the impact of seed placement on the treatment. RESULTS: The overall mean (+/-SD) difference between implanted and planned positions was 9 +/- 5 mm for the aggregate seed population. No significant systematic directional displacements were observed for this whole population. However, for individual patients, systematic displacements were observed, implying that intrapatient offsets occur during the procedure. Mean displacements for seeds in the different anatomic areas were not found to be significantly different from the mean for the entire seed population. However, small directional trends were observed within the anatomy, potentially indicating some bias in the delivery. Despite observed differences between the planned and implanted seed positions, the median (range) V90 for the 20 patients was 97% (66%-100%), and acceptable dosimetry was achieved for critical structures. CONCLUSIONS: No significant trends or systematic errors were observed in the placement of seeds in PBSI, including seeds implanted directly into the seroma. Recorded seed displacements may be related to intrapatient setup adjustments. Despite observed seed displacements, acceptable postimplant dosimetry was achieved.",eng,0

However, many women are still treated with mastectomy, due to logistical issues related to the long course of radiotherapy (RT). To reduce mastectomy rates and/or omission of RT after breast-conserving surgery, shorter, hypofractionated RT treatments have been introduced. More recently, the necessity of routinely treating the entire breast in all patients has been questioned, leading to the development of partial breast radiotherapy. With accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) these two approaches have been combined: the tumor bed with a 1-2 cm margin is irradiated either intra-operatively (single fraction) or postoperatively over 5-15 days. Different techniques have been developed, including interstitial brachytherapy, intra-cavity brachytherapy, intra-operative radiotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. These techniques are being evaluated in several ongoing phase III studies. Since its introduction, APBI has been the subject of continuous debate. ASTRO and GEC-ESTRO have published guidelines for patient selection for APBI, and strongly recommend that APBI be carried out within ongoing clinical trials. Recently, the patient selection criteria for APBI have also been up for debate, following the publication of results from different groups that do/do not confirm a difference in recurrence risk among the ASTRO defined risk groups. This paper reviews the different APBI techniques, current recommendations for patient selection, available clinical data and ongoing clinical trials. A case report is included to illustrate the need for careful follow-up of patients treated with APBI. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,0

WBI is delivered using high-energy external beam radiation and typically consists of approximately 5 weeks of daily treatments to the entire breast, with or without inclusion of a boost"" to the primary site. Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) and accelerated whole-breast irradiation (AWBI) have been developed as alternatives to conventional WBI for selected patients with early-stage breast cancer. Given its large size and long follow-up, the Canadian trial of AWBI has been widely considered as practice-changing, and additional studies of AWBI are maturing or newly-launched. Use of APBI is based on the observation that the majority of local recurrences occur near the primary tumor site. Because a smaller portion of the breast is irradiated, treatment courses can often be abbreviated, and techniques such as conformal external beam, catheter- or balloon-based brachytherapy, and intra-operative radiation have been developed. Data from early APBI randomized trials and retrospective studies report mixed results. However, given the protracted time to local recurrence and complications following breast-conserving therapy, definitive results from contemporary randomized clinical trials comparing conventional WBI against AWBI or APBI are still limited.""",,0

Although, clinical series have been described, there are few studies describing risk factors for complications. The objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of complications in a series of consecutive patients submitted to NSM and differences between clinical risk factors, breast volume, and different incision types. In a cohort-designed study, 158 reconstructed patients (invasive/in situ cancer and high risk for cancer) were stratified into groups based on different types of incision used (hemi-periareolar, double-circle periareolar, and Wise-pattern). They were matched for age, body mass index, associated clinical diseases, smoking, and weight of specimen. Also included were patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy. Mean follow-up was 65.6 months. In 106 (67 %) patients, NSM was performed for breast cancer treatment and in 52 (32.9 %) for cancer prophylaxis. Thirty-nine (24.6 %) patients were submitted to hemi-periareolar technique, 67 (42.4 %) to double-circle periareolar incision, and 52 (33 %) to Wise-pattern incision. The reconstruction was performed with tissue expander and implant-expander. Local recurrence rate was 3.7 % and the incidence of distant metastases was 1.8 %. Obese patients and higher weight of specimen had a higher risk for complications. After adjusting risk factors (BMI, weight of specimen), the complications were higher for patients submitted to hemi-periareolar and Wise-pattern incisions. This follow-up survey demonstrates that NSM facilitates optimal breast reconstruction by preserving the majority of the breast skin. Selected patients can have safe outcomes and therefore this may be a feasible option for breast cancer management. Success depends on coordinated planning with the oncologic surgeon and careful preoperative and intraoperative management. Surgical risk factors include incision type, obesity, and weight of breast specimen.",eng,0

Despite its oncologic benefits, the radiotherapy may cause unpredictable outcomes in soft tissues, especially in patients undergoing breast reconstruction. Described recently, intraoperative irradiation (IORT) has been indicated for selected patients as an alternative to radiotherapy with fewer adverse local effects. Clinical use of reduction mammaplasty (RM) techniques in oncologic breast surgery has been described previously. However, no previous studies have mentioned its application after breast conservation surgery and IORT. Methods: The authors used RM to reconstruct a partial breast tissue defect secondary to breast conservation surgery followed by IORT treatment in a 46-year-old patient with an 11-mm invasive ductal carcinoma between the superior internal quadrants of the right breast. Results: Satisfactory breast volume and shape were achieved, and no immediate or late complications were observed. After 2 postoperative years, no evidence of fat necrosis, tumor recurrence, or tissue volume loss was observed. Conclusion: The initial data indicate that RM in the setting of breast conservation surgery reconstruction and IORT is feasible. With appropriate patient selection, respecting indications and limitations, RM has its place among the various reconstructive techniques. Additional studies with larger clinical series and longer follow-up periods are necessary to analyze the precise IORT effects in patients submitted to immediate breast conservation surgery reconstruction. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,0

Although immediate reconstruction following breast-conserving surgery has been described, little information is available regarding surgical management in reoperative settings due to positive margins. We studied the influence of intraoperatively assessed and postoperatively controlled surgical margin status on the type of breast-conserving surgery and report our results regarding complications in a reoperative breast reconstruction scenario. All patients were seen by a multidisciplinary team who recommended breast-conserving surgery. According to the breast volume, ptosis and tumor size/location, the patients were also evaluated by a plastic surgeon, who recommended reconstruction with the appropriate technique. Intraoperative assessment of surgical margins was determined by histological examination of frozen sections. The mean follow-up time was 48 months. Two hundred and eighteen patients (88.5%) underwent breast-conserving surgery and immediate reconstruction. Twelve (5.5%) patients had a positive tumor margin after review of the permanent section. All patients underwent re-exploration. In 1.3%, a second reconstructive technique was indicated and in 2.2% a skin-sparing mastectomy with total reconstruction was performed. Our findings support the important role of the intraoperative assessment of surgical margins and its interference in the selection of reconstruction techniques and negative margins; however, it will not guarantee complete excision of the tumor.

The system reduces skin dose and potential toxicity. Materials and Methods: Brachytherapy intensity modulation is accomplished using the radionuclide <sup>169</sup>Yb as the brachytherapy source. Because modulating photons from low-energy 169Yb would require relatively thin amounts of high Z material (such as gold), it is possible to achieve dose distributions which better conform to the patient anatomy. We theoretically quantified the effects of modulator thickness, modulator angular extent, modulator axial extent, balloon diameter and balloon-to- skin distance through a series of Monte Carlo simulations to determine applicator parameters that will improve dose distributions in these troubling clinical geometries. Using these Monte Carlo results as a guide, we applied this technique to two specific clinical conditions: with the balloon placed 7 mm from the skin surface, (the minimum recommended under the NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 Phase III Protocol) and with the balloon placed at 4 mm from the skin surface which is well below the minimum recommended distance. The objective in both trials is to achieve tolerable skin dose while delivering the prescription dose to the treatment site. Radiochromic film measurements were made to confirm Monte Carlo results. Results: Dosimetric results are presented. The effects of modulator thickness, modulator angular extent, modulator axial extent, balloon diameter and balloon-to-skin distance are quantified. A 0.07 mm (70 mm) gold shield modulated the dose distribution sufficiently to locate the 100% isodose line at the skin surface located only 7 mm from the balloon surface. A 0.20 mm (200 mm) gold shield modulated the dose distribution sufficiently to locate the 100% isodose line at the skin surface located only 4 mm from the balloon surface. The experimental film measurements are in good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulation. Conclusions: These studies clearly show that the use of a modulating breast applicator in conjunction with a <sup>169</sup>Yb source can sufficiently modulate the intensity in cases where the skin separation is less than optimum. Such a modulating applicator can permit balloon brachytherapy to be performed in cases where the skin surface is closer to the treatment site than is currently recommended by NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413. Perhaps more importantly, such an applicator could be used to limit the dose to the skin in cases where the skin surface is within these acceptable limits (7-10 mm) in order to further reduce the probability of skin toxicity. This system permits balloon-based breast brachytherapy to better conform to patient anatomy, reduce potential toxicity by reducing skin dose, and permit application of this balloon technique to a greater number of patients now excluded due to suboptimal skin spacing.",,0

CT data sets comprising 58 suitable patients with breast carcinoma undergoing placement of a catheter into the IMV during breast conservative surgery were evaluated for the study. CT was performed with a radio-opaque dummy wire placed into the IMC catheter. The following measurements were recorded in the second, third and the fourth intercostal spaces: anteroposterior distance from skin to the IMC catheter; transverse distance from mid-sternum to the IMC catheter; and anteroposterior distance from the skin to the heart. Finally, the IMC angle was determined. At the second intercostal space, the mean anteroposterior distance (range) was 29.0 mm (14.6-48.6 mm) and mean transverse distance was 26.1 mm (18.2-36.3 mm). The corresponding mean values for the third space were 32.5 mm (20.0-45.6 mm) and 24.1 mm (17.8-39.7 mm) and for the fourth intercostal space were 31.6 mm (21.1-45.6 mm) and 24.3 mm (15.6-34.3 mm), respectively. The mean skin to heart distance was 36.2 mm on the left side and 47.8 mm on the right side (p < 0.001). The mean IMC angle was 40.3 degrees (95% confidence interval: 25-55.6). There appears to be a wide variation in the depth and location of the IMC, as recorded by CT measurements of the catheter in the IMV, demonstrating the need for individual planning. The IMC nodal area is likely to be out of the tangential portals employed in conventional practice.",eng,0

IORT may be used in surgical conservation therapy as a boost to the bed of the resected tumour and it is defined as 'the best gold standard'. The aim of the study was to present the author's own experience in the application of IORT as a boost to the bed in breast cancer conservation therapy. Material and Methodology: From May 2008 to March 2010 118 patients with breast cancer underwent conservation therapy with IORT applied to the tumour bed. On average the observation period was 22.81 months. Different aspects of surgical procedure were subjected to analysis as preparation for IORT (ROLL/SNOLL, sentinel node biopsy, tissue margins, resected tissue volume). The results of oncological treatment in the presented period were evaluated. The toxicity of the technique was evaluated by means of the LENT-SOMA scale and the cosmetic effect - by means of the Harris/Limbergen scale. Results: IORT requires modified surgical procedure during operation. Appropriate, wide dissection of tissues around the tumour and subsequent resection with intraoperative examination guarantee achieving correct margins. Thanks to the intraoperative examination in the analysed group as many as 40 patients (33.7%) had their margins radicalised. The evaluation of the volume of resected tissues did not reveal differences between palpable lesions and the non-palpable lesions where the SNOLL technique was applied. Thanks to the intraoperative sentinel node biopsy 16 patients avoided another surgery. No relapse of the neoplastic process was diagnosed during the period of observation subject to analysis. Late toxicity was specified as grade zero in 50 patients (42.4%). Due to the ambiguous and suspicious image in radiological examinations 6 patients (5.08%) underwent resection of the lesion or biopsy. Good or very good cosmetic effect was achieved in 80% of the patients. Conclusions: IORT as a boost is a technique ensuring very good results of treatment of patients with breast cancer both in terms of the oncological aspect and the cosmetic effect. The technique is characterised by a small number of complications. However, it requires certain modification of the surgical procedure during the operation and consideration of such accompanying techniques as ROLL/SNOLL, sentinel node biopsy and intraoperative examination..",,0

Long-term follow-up has demonstrated equivalent survival to mastectomy. However, standard WBRT to the conserved breast requires daily radiation treatment, 5 days per week, for 5-7 weeks. This schedule imposes a considerable burden on breast cancer patients and healthcare systems alike. For the last decade, there has been considerable interest in lessening the volume of breast treated with radiotherapy and reducing the number of fractions of radiation treatment. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), including intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), delivers high-dose radiation immediately surrounding the lumpectomy cavity, with relative sparing of the majority of the ipsilateral breast. Hypofractionated WBRT delivers radiation to the entire ipsilateral breast; however, this is achieved using a smaller number of fractions and total dose of radiotherapy. The attraction of less invasive or demanding radiotherapy schedules has led to the widespread introduction of APBI before its longterm results have been established. In the past 5 years, data from prospective trials of hypofractionated WBRT and IORT compared to standard WBRT have become available. Additionally, a large, prospective randomized study of APBI versus WBRT is nearing accrual. In this review article, we will discuss these new innovative techniques in radiotherapy for breast cancer. We will also discuss the recently completed and ongoing prospective studies that will provide a robust evaluation of the safety and efficacy of these techniques.",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: During the academic years 2013 to 2014 and 2014 to 2015, the Association of Residents in Radiation Oncology (ARRO) conducted an electronic survey of post-graduate year-5 radiation oncology residents in the United States during the final 3 months of training. Descriptive statistics are reported. RESULTS: Sixty-six chief residents completed the survey in 2013 to 2014 (53% response rate), and 69 completed the survey in 2014 to 2015 (64% response rate). Forty to 85% percent of residents reported inadequate exposure to high-dose rate and low-dose rate brachytherapy. Nearly all residents in both years (>90%) reported adequate clinical experience for the following disease sites: breast, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, head and neck, and lung. However, as few as 56% reported adequate experience in lymphoma or pediatric malignancies. More than 90% of residents had participated in retrospective research projects, with 20% conducting resident-led prospective clinical trials and 50% conducting basic science or translational projects. Most chief residents reported working 60 or fewer hours per week in the clinical/hospital setting and performing fewer than 15 hours per week tasks that were considered to have little or no educational value. There was more than 80% compliance with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) work hour limits. Fifty-five percent of graduating residents intended to join an established private practice group, compared to 25% who headed for academia. Residents perceive the job market to be more competitive than previous years. CONCLUSIONS: This first update of the ARRO chief resident survey since the 2007 to 2008 academic year documents US radiation oncology residents' experiences and conditions over a 2-year period.

This is proven in two large trials: ELIOT and TARGIT-A based on electron high voltage beam and lowkV X-ray energy respectively. Methods: Published results of the two trials aimed to evaluating local recurrence as the final outcome. In this study these results were compared with each other. Results: In the ELIOT study the local recurrence rate is 4/4% versus 0.4% in patients who received IORT and EBRT, in comparison to 3.2% and 1.3% in the TARGIT-A trial; these differences needs to be under more consideration regarding the efficacy and beneficence of IORT. Herebywe are going to analyze the data of these two trials to confirm the strategy of IORT in breast cancer as boost or radical modalities. Patient selection according to classification of ASTRO or ESTRO guidelines confirmed the local recurrence rate of IOERT (ELIOT) in low risk patients similar to TARGIT decrease to less than 1.9%. Conclusion: Statistical analysis revealed that in patients of both trials with matching clinical, pathological and biological profile for both methods, the radical IORT using electron and low kV X-ray are effective and acceptable.

Journal Article,S. Nag,2004.0,High dose rate brachytherapy: its clinical applications and treatment guidelines,", ","Brachytherapy has the advantage of delivering a high dose to the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. With proper case selection and delivery technique, high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy has great promise, because it eliminates radiation exposure, allows short treatment times, and can be performed on an outpatient basis. Additionally, use of a single-stepping source, allows optimization of dose distribution by varying the dwell time at each dwell position. However, when HDR brachytherapy is used, the treatments must be executed carefully, because the short treatment times do not allow any time for correction of errors, and mistakes can result in harm to patients. Hence, it is very important that all personnel involved in HDR brachytherapy be well trained and be constantly alert. It is expected that the use of HDR brachytherapy will greatly expand over the next decade and that refinements will occur primarily in the integration of imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, intraoperative ultrasonography) and optimization of dose distribution. It is anticipated that better tumor localization and normal tissue definition will help to optimize dose distribution to the tumor and reduce normal tissue exposure. The development of well-controlled randomized trials addressing issues of efficacy, toxicity, quality of life, and costs-versus-benefits will ultimately define the role of HDR brachytherapy in the therapeutic armamentarium.",eng,0

The present study examines the pathological false-negative cases on intraoperative sentinel lymph node investigations and evaluates their outcomes. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 183 cases with clinically node-negative breast cancer who had undergone sentinel node biopsy. When the sentinel node was noted to contain malignant cells intraoperatively, a complete axillary lymph node dissection was performed subsequently. The patients with tumor free sentinel nodes underwent no further axillary surgery. The pathological false-negative cases in this series were defined as patients with lymph node involvement which was revealed postoperatively, despite negative intraoperative sentinel node examinations. After these surgeries and/or adjuvant therapies, interval clinical evaluations were performed for all patients. RESULTS: Intraoperative diagnosis of the sentinel node was 96.2% accurate compared with the results of permanent sections. There were six pathological false-negative cases, a false-negative rate of 4.1%, all of which had only micrometastasis. Five cases received systemic adjuvant therapy and have been disease-free, however, one patient who refused further therapy developed infraclavicular lymph node metastasis two years after surgery.

The dosimetric properties of these methods are compared. Material and Methods: Planning target volumes (PTVs) of the same size but of different shapes are assumed, corresponding to the technique's specific situs. Dose distributions for the PTVs and for surrounding tissues are demonstrated by dose-volume histograms and a list of physical parameters. A dose inhomogeneity index (DII) is introduced to describe the deviation of a delivered from the prescribed dose, reaching its minimal value 0 in case of perfect homogeneity. Results: In terms of DII, IOERT reaches the lowest value followed by the MammoSite, the Intrabeam and interstitial implants. The surrounding tissues receive the smallest average dose with IOERT, closely followed by the orthovolt system. Conclusion: When comparing simplified geometric figures, IOERT delivers the most homogeneous dose distributions. However, in clinical reality PTVs often present asymmetric shapes instead of ideal geometries. Due to a strictly centric dose fall-off, any system with a round central applicator will have technical limits. During IOERT margin-directed applicator guidance is possible and interstitial brachytherapy allows for polygonal dose shaping. These techniques seem to be superior for asymmetric PTV irradiation. © Urban & Vogel.",,0

This study aimed to investigate the safety, effectiveness and economic evaluation of intra-operative radiation therapy. METHODS: The scientific literature was searched in the main biomedical databases (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Cochrane Library and PubMed) up to March 2014. Two independent reviewers selected the papers based on pre-established inclusion criteria, with any disagreements being resolved by consensus. Data were then extracted and summarized in a structured form. RESULTS from studies were analyzed and discussed within a descriptive synthesis. RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. It seems that outcomes from using intraoperative radiation therapy can be considered in various kinds of cancers like breast, pancreatic and colorectal cancers. The application of this method may provide significant survival increase only for colorectal cancer, but this increase was not significant for other types of cancer. This technology had low complications; and it is relatively safe. Using intra-operative radiation therapy could potentially be accounted as a cost-effective strategy for controlling and managing breast cancer. CONCLUSION: According to the existing evidences, that are the highest medical evidences for using intra-operative radiation therapy, one can generally conclude that intra-operative radiation therapy is considered as a relatively safe and cost-effective method for managing early-stage breast cancer and it can significantly increase the survival of patients with colorectal cancer. Also, the results of this study have policy implications with respect to the reimbursement of this technology.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Simulator X-rays, CT scans, and dosimetric studies were repeated on alternate days in 14 consecutive patients treated with radical intraoperative two- or three-plane nylon catheter high-dose-rate implant (34 Gy in 10 fractions within 5 days). RESULTS: Significant variation was found in catheter length, but no major change was noted in implant geometry, homogeneity, or inhomogeneity indexes. A variation in length of >5 mm in one or more catheters was seen in all patients and >10 mm in 11 patients at any time during the implant. Of the 171 catheters in 14 patients, 100 (58%) and 38 (22%) showed a variation of >5 mm or >10 mm, respectively. The variation of >10 mm was reduced from 32% of catheters in the first 5 patients to 17% in the subsequent 9 patients (p = 0.028). Rigid catheter fixation might reduce length variation but may cause skin necrosis if the expanding cavity indents the skin for a long period against the fixation device. A dose homogeneity index of 0.90 (range 0.85-0.92) and dose nonuniformity ratio of 0.20 (range 0.12-0.25) were satisfactory.

This study addresses the question of whether internal mammary arteries are unsuitable for grafting due to radiation-based damage in patients with history of thoracic radiation therapy. We review our experience in this subset of surgical candidates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting with use of at least one ITA were enrolled and matched to 49 comparable nonirradiated individuals by propensity scoring system. Preoperative and postoperative data were collected and compared. A 18-month clinical follow-up was performed. RESULTS: Intraoperative mammary artery flow was assessed by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography probe, and there was no significant difference between irradiated and nonirradiated individuals (36 +/- 8.3 mL/min vs 39 +/- 7.2 mL/min, p = 0.15). The two study groups were also comparable in terms of survival (overall mortality, 2%) and recurrence of angina and perfusion defect at control stress perfusion nuclear scan (p = 0.99 and p = 0.77, respectively). One arterial graft showed stenosis at postoperative angiography. The dose of radiation therapy administered did not correlate with graft flow values after anastomosis. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the use of a monolateral or bilateral ITA is not associated with early graft failure in patients with history of chest/mediastinal irradiation. Skeletonization harvesting technique might be recommended because of the frequent presence of fibrous tissue around the in situ vessel. Arterial graft stenosis in thorax-irradiated patients should be attributed to the primary atherosclerotic disease rather than to irradiation itself.",eng,0

Weidhaas,2014.0,"A PHASE II TRIAL OF BALLOON-CATHETER PARTIAL BREAST BRACHYTHERAPY OPTIMIZATION IN THE TREATMENT OF STAGE 0, I AND IIA BREAST CARCINOMA",10.1007/s13566-014-0153-8,"OBJECTIVES: (a) To prospectively determine if multidwell position dose delivery can decrease skin dose and resultant toxicity over single dwell balloon-catheter partial breast irradiation, and (b) to evaluate whether specific skin parameters could be safely used instead of skin-balloon distance alone for predicting toxicity and treatment eligibility. METHODS: A single-arm phase II study using a Simon two-stage design was performed on 28 women with stage 0-II breast cancer. All patients were treated with multiple dwell position balloon-catheter brachytherapy. The primary endpoint was >/= grade 2 skin toxicity. Initial entry required a balloon-skin distance >/= 7 mm. Based on the toxicity in the first 16 patients, additional patients were treated irrespective of skin-balloon distance as long as the Dmax to 1 mm skin thickness was < 130%. RESULTS: Compared to the phantom single dwell plans, multidwell planning yielded superior PTV coverage as per median V90, V95 and V100, but had slightly worse V150, V200 and DHI. Dmax to skin was decreased by multidwell planning at multiple skin thicknesses. The most common acute toxicity was grade 1 erythema (57%), and only two patients (7%) developed acute grade 2 toxicity (erythema). Late grade 1 fibrosis was seen in 32%. No patients experienced grade 3, 4, or 5 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Multidwell position planning for balloon-catheter brachytherapy results in lower skin doses with equal to superior PTV coverage and an overall low rate of initial skin toxicity. Our data suggest that limiting the Dmax to < 130% to 1 mm thick skin is achievable and results in minimal toxicity.",Eng,0

Jeziorski,2006.0,Sentinel node biopsy in patients with breast cancer--evaluation of exposure to radiation of medical staff,10.1016/j.ejso.2005.11.012,"AIM: To measure the absorbed doses of radiation to hands of medical staff performing sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients. METHODS: The study was conducted in 2004, during sentinel node biopsies in 13 breast cancer patients (T1/T2N0). Sentinel nodes were identified with the use of combined radiotracer/blue dye technique (lymphoscintigraphy--99mTc on albumin carrier, surgery after 24 h; blue dye; intraoperative detection of gamma radiation). Highly sensitive thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) made of LiF were used to assess the absorbed doses of radiation during the procedure. During lymphoscintigraphy and during surgical procedure a total of 57 TLDs was placed on different parts of hands of medical staff. RESULTS: Maximal dose recorded during lymphoscintigraphy by TLDs placed on the hands of the physician injecting the radiotracer was 164 microSv. Mean recorded doses were higher for non-dominant hand, especially for distal parts of the index finger, third finger and thumb. During the surgical procedure, TLDs placed on the hands of medical staff recorded much lower doses of radiation than during lymphoscintigraphy. The highest dose was recorded by TLD placed on the pulp of the dominant hand index finger (22 microSv) of the operating surgeon. Mean doses recorded by TLDs placed on the hands of the operating surgeon ranged from 2 to 8 microSv. The absorbed dose of radiation to hands of the scrub nurse was similar to that absorbed to hands of the operating surgeon. CONCLUSION: The maximum recorded dose during sentinel node biopsy in this study was 2200 times smaller than current 1-year dose limit.",eng,0

The factors that were investigated included the use of a dry heat block versus a hot water bath to heat the (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid bulk vial, amount of (99m)TcOH4(-) added to form the sulfur colloid particles, time between the unit dose calibration and the injection of the dose, and breast quadrant in which the injection occurred. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively and quantitatively analyzed from images and reports of 488 patients with breast cancer who had undergone SLN mapping and intraoperative SLN identification from January 1, 2008, to June 30, 2011, inclusive. The dependent variables assessed were the number of SLNs visualized during lymphoscintigraphy, number of radioactive SLNs removed during surgery, and total number of lymph nodes removed intraoperatively. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in outcomes when comparing the amount of (99m)TcOH4(-) added during the preparation process to form the sulfur colloid particles, time between the unit dose calibration time and the time that the unit doses were injected, or location in the breast tissue in which the unit dose was administered. Initially, there were observed significant differences in outcomes when the heating methods used to prepare the (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid were compared. When the increased number of patients who were administered a calibrated unit dose activity of 74 MBq in the group using a dry heat block preparation method was taken into account, however, the findings were not significant. CONCLUSION: The use of a dry heat block versus a hot water bath to heat the (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid bulk vial, amount of (99m)TcOH4(-) added to form sulfur colloid particles, time between the unit dose calibration and the injection of the dose, and breast quadrant in which the injection occurred do not affect the number of SLNs detected during SLN mapping and during intraoperative SLN identification.",eng,0

By adding adjuvant radiotherapy the recurrence rate is reduced to 1% after 4 years. Albeit the reduction of recurrence after adjuvant radiation in younger women is higher (8% to 1% after 5 years) the absolute reduction of risk is the same. Recently it has been shown that single dose intraoperative tumorbed irradiation is non-inferior to whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) regarding local control in selected patients. In this single arm, prospective phase II study we want to confirm the efficacy of single dose intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in elderly patients with low risk breast cancer. Methods: Therefore we started to recruit patients older than 70 with small, ductal invasive breast cancer (cT1 or small cT2), without clinically positive lymph nodes (cN0). Patients receive breast conserving surgery with IORT (20 Gy, Intrabeam, Carl Zeiss Surgical). By presence of risk factors like an extensive intraductal component, lymphangioinvasion, pN+, other histology than ductal invasive, multifocality and -centricity the IORT will be completed with adjuvant WBRT with 46 Gy. Patients with pN1 will be treated with 50 Gy WBRT and pN2 patients receive 50 Gy WBRT including the lymphatic drainage. Results: The expected local recurrence rate is 0.5/1/1.5% after 2.5/5/7.5 years, respectively. Stopping rules for the study are if the local recurrence rate is higher than 3/4/6% after 2.5/5/7.5 years.

BCS and radiotherapy (RT) are early invasive breast cancer treatment methods widely accepted in the last decades. The standard technique of RT after BCS is represented by external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) via tangential fields up to a total dose of 45 to 50 Gy. Generally accepted criteria for identification of high risk subgroups, in which irradiation boost is recommended, are still being discussed, as are the optimal boost technique and its impact on local tumor control and cosmetic outcome of the treatment. Although the two most frequent boost techniques (electron vs. brachytherapy) provide similar results, the notion prevails that high dose rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy leads to a more pronounced reduction of local relapse rate, whereas the electron boost provides for better cosmesis. However, these differences appear statistically non-significant. Correct treatment indication and precise realization of the given technique performed by experienced personnel at a technically well-equipped workplace are crucial. Even though guidelines in these topics are being established based on the results of retrospective and recently published prospective trials, some aspects of boost irradiation still remain controversial. The final results of prospective boost trials with longer follow-up, involving analyses based on pathologically defined subgroups, will clarify these controversies. Preliminary results with recently developed boost techniques - intraoperative RT (IORT), CT-image based 3D conformal brachytherapy, and 3D virtual brachytherapy - are promising. More experience and longer follow-up will help to define the influence of these methods on local tumor control in breast cancer patients with conservative surgery and RT.",,0

In three of these cases, one involving poor arterial inflow, one of poor venous outflow, and one of poor perfusion of a mastectomy flap, the intraoperative plan was adjusted accordingly and follow-up imaging demonstrated improvement. In the fourth case, no adjustment was made at operation. However this patient required a return to the operating room for venous congestion of the flap, which was corrected without sequela. Overall flap survival was 100%. We concluded that laser-assisted indocyanine green fluorescence angiography appears to provide important information that has helped guide intraoperative decision making in our series.""",eng,0

Supine whole breast radiotherapy is the standard adjuvant treatment for early stage breast cancer after breast conserving therapy. Prone whole breast radiotherapy and partial breast irradiation have emerged as clinically accepted alternative options in some cases. In this study, a novel biologically-based carcinogenesis model was used to quantify and to compare the predicted rates of secondary lung malignancies for the three different treatment techniques. Materials/Methods: Computed tomography-based treatment plans were generated for fifteen early stage breast cancer patients using supine whole breast, prone whole breast, and partial breast 3-D conformal radiotherapy techniques. In addition, seven patients were simulated for balloon brachytherapy treatment planning. The treated breast and ipsilateral lung were contoured, and dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for these organs were determined. A biologically-based mathematical model of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis was used to determine the excess absolute risk of secondary lung malignancies for the different techniques. These risks were compared for each technique and to the baseline population. Results: Prone breast radiotherapy plans delivered significantly lower mean doses to the ipsilateral lung in all patients in our study compared with partial breast irradiation and supine whole breast irradiation. The average mean lung doses for the ipsilateral lung were measured to be 54 cGy for prone whole breast irradiation vs. 275 cGy for 3-D conformal partial breast irradiation vs. 307 cGy for balloon brachytherapy partial breast irradiation vs. 646 cGy for supine whole breast irradiation (p< 0.0001). A significantly higher risk of secondary lung cancers was predicted for supine whole breast irradiation when compared with prone whole breast irradiation (RR 2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.29-2.93) and partial breast irradiation (RR 1.57; 95% CI, 1.33-1.81). Conclusions: For patients with early stage breast cancer, prone whole breast radiation therapy is associated with more than twofold lower predicted secondary lung cancer risk when compared with supine whole breast radiation therapy. Partial breast irradiation is also associated with a lower predicted secondary lung cancer risk when compared with supine whole breast radiotherapy but to a smaller extent than prone breast radiotherapy.",,0

Conventional external radiotherapy delivers a total dose of 45 to 50 Gy in 1.8 to 2Gy/fraction over 5 to 6 weeks +/- boost to tumour bed of 10 to 16 Gy over 1 to 2 weeks. Advances in breast cancer radiobiology such that a more precise estimation of biological equivalent dose, and improvement in radiotherapy delivery technology with better dose homogeneity in the target volume resulted in the increasing use of hypofractionated scheme (i.e. larger daily fraction dose) to shorten overall treatment time. Recently, there were clinical trials comparing the delivery of radiobiologicallyequivalent total dose using the hypofractionated scheme with overall shortened treatment time, with conventional 1.8 to 2 Gy daily fraction scheme. These trials showed equivalent locoregional recurrence rate, disease-free survival and overall survival without significant increase in acute and late toxicities, including late breast cosmetic complications. Concerns were raised as these trials included mainly low risk, elderly patients treated by breast conservative surgery without chemotherapy such that generalisation to all patients may not be appropriate. Also, the optimal hypo-fractionated schedule remains to be defined. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) greatly reduced the overall treatment time of breast radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) employing single fraction treatment given during operation is particularly appealing as the treatment is convenient, fast with good sparing of normal structures. However, due to the lack of long-term follow-up data, APBI is considered not a standard option and should be performed in a clinical trial setting.",,0

While its history dates back to the origins of the field, in recent years brachytherapy treatment paradigms have been evolving considerably. This has been driven primarily by advancements in imaging, which allow for precise placement of sources and applicators under image guidance, and volume-based optimization to ensure adequate tumor coverage while sparing adjacent normal tissue. There has been a shift towards high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for many of the disease sites treated with brachytherapy. Simultaneously, with increasingly conformal treatment, there has been a shift towards utilization of higher doses per fraction, over fewer fractions, for specific disease sites where hypofractionation is believed to confer a radiobiological benefit. Here we review recent data and trends for those disease sites and conditions that are commonly treated with brachytherapy, including prostate, gynecologic, breast, head and neck, and skin cancers and salvage of recurrent disease.

In Europe, some groups started a prospective multicentre trial to investigate the use of the MammoSite RTS. In this early publication, we analysed the surgical procedure and placement of the MammoSite, treatment planning and radiation delivery complications, and early cosmesis, as well as the comfort of the patients. Between June 2002 and March 2005, a total of 54 low-risk breast cancer patients fulfilling the enrolment criteria were implanted intra- or postoperatively using the MammoSite applicator. After inflating the balloon in the excision cavity, the reference isodose was defined 1cm from the balloon's surface. Twenty-eight patients were treated with primary brachytherapy with a total dose of 34 Gy (2x3.4 Gy) and 16 patients had a boost with a mean dose of 13.3 Gy (range: 7.5-15 Gy; 2x2.5 Gy) combined with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Doses ranged between 46 and 50 Gy. We analysed the postimplant anatomic position of the applicator in relation to the skin and chest wall as well as the geometric form of the balloon via ultrasound, computed tomography and X-ray before, during and after the treatment. Forty-four out of 54 patients (81.5%) were eligible for MammoSite RTS brachytherapy. Ten patients were excluded from the trial due to the strict study criteria and received no brachytherapy. Balloon rupture occurred in two cases. We observed seroma in 16 patients (36%); furthermore, an abscess developed in two patients (4.5%) within 3 months of implantation. Postoperative air gaps and haematoma were successfully reduced by draining the operation cavity in one institution. At a mean follow-up of 14 months (range 3-31 months), the skin-related side effects observed were skin discoloration or inflammation in 36 patients (82%) and teleangiectasia in eight patients (18%). The MammoSite RTS is a feasible treatment modality for postoperative partial breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for selected low-risk breast cancer patients. The main advantage of the system is the necessity of only one applicator for the delivery of fractionated radiotherapy over a 5-day treatment period. In addition, patient tolerance of the procedure is high. Based on this early experience, the method may serve as a successful alternative to conventional multicatheter brachytherapy for a highly select group of patients, but we have to bear in mind the higher level of acute toxicity.",eng,0

All patients had previously been treated with full-dose adjuvant external-beam irradiation (EBRT). Disease-free interval after salvage treatment, local tumor control and side effects were analyzed retrospectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2002, a total of 32 consecutive patients were treated. 13 patients initially treated with mastectomy and postoperative irradiation and 19 patients initially treated with breast-conserving surgery and postoperative irradiation developed a local recurrence. The mean dose of previous radiation therapy was 58 Gy (range, 42-64 Gy), applied by conventional fractionation. After implantation +/- surgery of recurrent disease and CT-based 3-D planning, 15 patients were irradiated with HDR-IMBT (intensity-modulated brachytherapy) with a mean dose of 28 Gy (range, 10-30 Gy, 2 x 2.5 Gy/day at 6-h daily interfraction interval) and 17 patients received PDR-IMBT with a mean dose 30 Gy (range, 10-45 Gy, 5 x 1 Gy/day at 2-h pulse intervals). Four patients underwent additional EBRT using a dose of 24-40 Gy electrons. Treatment was performed only on working days. RESULTS: After a mean post-implant follow-up of 19 months (range, 1-83 months), no signs of local recurrence were observed in 20 of the 32 patients. In twelve patients, local recurrence occurred after a mean follow-up of 13 months (range, 1-78 months). 20 of the 32 patients experienced an additional systemic progress. In one patient, an EORTC/RTOG grade 3 side effect (ulceration of the skin) was described, which was followed by a local recurrence 12 months posttherapeutically. CONCLUSION: Perioperative interstitial HDR/PDR-IMBT of localized breast or thoracic wall recurrences following previous full-dose EBRT appears to be a meaningful salvage treatment with acceptable toxicity.",eng,0

Kovacs,2006.0,Clinical experience with the MammoSite radiation therapy system for brachytherapy of breast cancer: results from an international phase II trial,10.1016/j.radonc.2006.05.010,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In a prospective multi-center phase II trial, we investigated the MammoSite Radiation Therapy System, a new device for delivering intracavitary brachytherapy following breast conserving surgery. The MammoSite is a dual lumen, closed ended catheter with a small, spherical inflatable balloon and a port for connecting a remote afterloader to the central lumen. We analyzed the surgical procedure and placement of the MammoSite, treatment planning and radiation delivery complications and cosmesis, as well the comfort for the patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2004 a total of 32 patients (pts) were implanted using the MammoSite. The reference isodose was defined 1cm from the balloon surface. We analyzed the post-implant anatomic position of the applicator and the geometric form of the balloon via ultrasound, CT and X-ray, related side effects, cosmetic outcome and patient quality of life. RESULTS: Twenty-three out of 32 patients (72%) were eligible for MammoSite intracavitary brachytherapy. Twenty-eight percentage had to be excluded because of different reasons. Eleven patients were treated with primary brachytherapy with a total dose of 34 Gy (2 x 3.4 Gy) and 12 had a boost with a mean dose of 13.3 Gy (range: 7.5-15 Gy; 2 x 2.5 Gy) combined with EBRT and doses ranged between 46 and 50 Gy. In three cases a balloon rupture occurred. We observed two abscesses within 3 months of implantation and serious seroma development in 10 patients (39%). Skin related side effects were erythema in 21 patients (91%), hyperpigmentation in 13 patients (56%) and teleangiectasia in six patients (26%) after mean follow-up 20 months. CONCLUSIONS: The MammoSite Radiation Therapy System is a feasible treatment modality for intracavitary brachytherapy of breast cancer after breast conserving surgery. The advantage of the system is only one applicator is necessary for the delivery of a fractionated radiotherapy. In addition, patient tolerance of the procedure is high. Critical issues concern possible overdosages at the skin reflected by a high rate of late skin damage after only 20 months of follow-up time. The method could serve as an alternative to conventional multi-catheter brachytherapy for a selected group of patients.",eng,0

However, its utilization has not been maximized because of logistics issues associated with the protracted treatment involved with the radiation treatment. Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) is an approach that treats only the lumpectomy bed plus a 1-2 cm margin, rather than the whole breast. Hence because of the small volume of irradiation a higher dose can be delivered in a shorter period of time. There has been growing interest for APBI and various approaches have been developed under phase I-III clinical studies; these include multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, balloon catheter brachytherapy, conformal external beam radiation therapy and intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT). Balloon-based brachytherapy approaches include Mammosite, Axxent electronic brachytherapy and Contura, Hybrid brachytherapy devices include SAVI and ClearPath. This paper reviews the different techniques, identifying the weaknesses and strength of each approach and proposes a direction for future research and development. It is evident that APBI will play a role in the management of a selected group of early breast cancer. However, the relative role of the different techniques is yet to be clearly identified.© 2010 Njeh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,0

Noguchi,2002.0,Therapeutic relevance of breast cancer micrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes,10.1046/j.1365-2168.2002.02294.x,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: This review examines the various methods of detecting occult breast cancer metastasis in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). The prognostic relevance of such micrometastases and isolated tumour cells, and their impact on stage migration and decision making with respect to axillary dissection and adjuvant systemic therapy, are discussed. RESULTS: Examination of SLNs by serial section with haematoxylin and eosin and/or immuno histochemical staining significantly increases the detection rate of micrometastases, even in patients with very small (T1) tumours. However, the prognostic relevance of isolated tumour cells and small micrometastases is uncertain. Moreover, deciding which patients might benefit from axillary dissection is complicated by the fact that adjuvant radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy alone may eradicate most micrometastases. CONCLUSION: Ongoing randomized trials comparing the results of SLN biopsy alone with those of axillary dissection should answer the question of whether isolated tumour cells and small micrometastases are clinically relevant. This should also indicate which patients with SLN micrometastasis are likely to benefit from axillary dissection. In this sense, SLN biopsy must be considered still to be at an investigative stage; outwith clinical trials complete axillary dissection should be performed on all patients with SLN micrometastasis.",eng,0
Journal Article,M. Noguchi,2004.0,Current controversies concerning sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer,10.1023/B:BREA.0000019952.55284.f2,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The objectives of this article are to review existing controversies regarding sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and to identify potential areas of consensus in order to eliminate routine axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). RESULTS: A combination of peritumoral injection with radioisotopes and subdermal or subareolar injection with blue dye may result in enhanced success rates of SLN identification. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is most useful for detecting an internal mammary SLN, but the practicability of internal mammary SLN biopsy is still in the investigative stage. Intraoperative diagnosis of SLN is useful because patients with SLN metastases may be treated immediately with ALND, but it is unreasonable to expect that either examination of frozen sections or imprint cytology will detect every metastatic disease. SLN micrometastases may be of prognostic importance and these can be identified with H and E staining on permanent sections of 200 micro m intervals. While ALND is preferable for patients even with a small tumor (T1) and SLN micrometastases, radiation therapy is an acceptable alternative. SLN biopsy may be indicated for patients with DCIS detected as a palpable mass or those with large calcification areas in the breast. The accuracy of SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered to be unproven. CONCLUSION: Since SLN biopsy has been adopted by surgeons around the world, consistency of technique and case selection has attained great significance.",eng,0

Yamashita,2006.0,A pilot study of wider use of accelerated partial breast irradiation: intraoperative margin-directed re-excision combined with sole high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy,", ","BACKGROUND: Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is generally limited to patients at extremely low risk of local recurrence. The significance of the risk factors, however, depends on the extent of surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy. In Japan, wide excision is generally supplemented by intraoperative margin-directed re-excision if the frozen section examination yields positive results. This approach combined with conventional radiotherapy achieved an excellent 10-year local control rate of 93%, and young age and ductal carcinoma in situ were not risk factors for local recurrence. To reduce the treatment duration, high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDRIB) was employed. The first APBI phase I / II trial in Japan was conducted to determine if wider indications for early breast cancer patients were appropriate. METHODS: The subjects comprised 20 patients including those with extensive intraductal component (n=7), ductal carcinoma in situ (n=2), positive final margins (n=3), and of younger age (< or = 45 years; n=5). Breast-conserving surgery using an intraoperative re-excision approach was followed by intraoperative implantation of applicators. Sole HDRIB of a 36-42 Gy in 6-7 fractions was delivered postoperatively over 3-4 days. Tumors were staged as follows: cT1 (n=12), cT2 (n=8), cN0 (n=20). Systemic therapy was used in 16 patients (80%). The median follow-up period was 52 months (range, 26-86 months). RESULTS: Te five-year crude local, distant control, and Kaplan-Meier cause-specific survival rates were 95%, 95%, and 89%, respectively. Fat necrosis developed in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Sole HDRIB with intraoperative margin-directed re-excision was feasible under wider indications compared to other contemporary APBI series, and achieved acceptable and similar results to these series in terms of the local control rate and complications.",eng,0

Ramanujan,2011.0,Preclinical evaluation of nuclear morphometry and tissue topology for breast carcinoma detection and margin assessment,10.1007/s10549-010-0914-z,"Prevention and early detection of breast cancer are the major prophylactic measures taken to reduce the breast cancer related mortality and morbidity. Clinical management of breast cancer largely relies on the efficacy of the breast-conserving surgeries and the subsequent radiation therapy. A key problem that limits the success of these surgeries is the lack of accurate, real-time knowledge about the positive tumor margins in the surgically excised tumors in the operating room. This leads to tumor recurrence and, hence, the need for repeated surgeries. Current intraoperative techniques such as frozen section pathology or touch imprint cytology severely suffer from poor sampling and non-optimal detection sensitivity. Even though histopathology analysis can provide information on positive tumor margins post-operatively (~2-3 days), this information is of no immediate utility in the operating rooms. In this article, we propose a novel image analysis method for tumor margin assessment based on nuclear morphometry and tissue topology and demonstrate its high sensitivity/specificity in preclinical animal model of breast carcinoma. The method relies on imaging nuclear-specific fluorescence in the excised surgical specimen and on extracting nuclear morphometric parameters (size, number, and area fraction) from the spatial distribution of the observed fluorescence in the tissue. We also report the utility of tissue topology in tumor margin assessment by measuring the fractal dimension in the same set of images. By a systematic analysis of multiple breast tissues specimens, we show here that the proposed method is not only accurate (~97% sensitivity and 96% specificity) in thin sections, but also in three-dimensional (3D) thick tissues that mimic the realistic lumpectomy specimens. Our data clearly precludes the utility of nuclear size as a reliable diagnostic criterion for tumor margin assessment. On the other hand, nuclear area fraction addresses this issue very effectively since it is a combination of both nuclear size and count in any given region of the analyzed image, and thus yields high sensitivity and specificity (~97%) in tumor detection. This is further substantiated by an independent parameter, fractal dimension, based on the tissue topology. Although the basic definition of cancer as an uncontrolled cell growth entails a high nuclear density in tumor regions, a simple but systematic exploration of nuclear distribution in thick tissues by nuclear morphometry and tissue topology as performed in this study has never been carried out, to the best of our knowledge. We discuss the practical aspects of implementing this imaging approach in automated tissue sampling scenario where the accuracy of tumor margin assessment can be significantly increased by scanning the entire surgical specimen rather than sampling only a few sections as in current histopathology analysis.",eng,0

It consists of a hemispherical source carrier containing 36 Cobalt-60 sources, a tungsten collimator with two built-in collimation sizes, a dynamically controlled patient support table and a breast immobilization cup also functioning as the stereotactic frame for the patient. The dosimetric output of the GammaPod was modelled using a Monte Carlo based treatment planning system. For the comparison, three-dimensional (3D) models of commonly used intra-cavitary breast brachytherapy techniques utilizing single lumen and multi-lumen balloon as well as peripheral catheter multi-lumen implant devices were created and corresponding 3D dose calculations were performed using the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group-43 formalism. Dose distributions for clinically relevant target volumes were optimized using dosimetric goals set forth in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol B-39. For clinical scenarios assuming similar target sizes and proximity to critical organs, dose coverage, dose fall-off profiles beyond the target and skin doses at given distances beyond the target were calculated for GammaPod and compared with the doses achievable by the brachytherapy techniques. The dosimetric goals within the protocol guidelines were fulfilled for all target sizes and irradiation techniques. For central targets, at small distances from the target edge (up to approximately 1 cm) the brachytherapy techniques generally have a steeper dose fall-off gradient compared to GammaPod and at longer distances (more than about 1 cm) the relation is generally observed to be opposite. For targets close to the skin, the relative skin doses were considerably lower for GammaPod than for any of the brachytherapy techniques. In conclusion, GammaPod allows adequate and more uniform dose coverage to centrally and peripherally located targets with an acceptable dose fall-off and lower relative skin dose than the brachytherapy techniques considered in this study.",eng,0

Cysteine cathepsins are highly up-regulated in a wide variety of cancers, both in tumor cells and in the tumor-supporting cells of the surrounding stroma. Therefore, tools that can be used to dynamically monitor their activity in vivo could be used as imaging contrast agents for intraoperative fluorescence image guided surgery (FGS). Although multiple classes of cathepsin-targeted substrate probes have been reported, most suffer from overall fast clearance from sites of protease activation, leading to reduced signal intensity and duration in vivo. Here we describe the design and synthesis of a series of near-infrared fluorogenic probes that exploit a latent cationic lysosomotropic effect (LLE) to promote cellular retention upon protease activation. These probes show tumor-specific retention, fast activation kinetics, and rapid systemic distribution. We demonstrate that they are suitable for detection of diverse cancer types including breast, colon and lung tumors. Most importantly, the agents are compatible with the existing, FDA approved, da Vinci surgical system for fluorescence guided tumor resection. Therefore, our data suggest that the probes reported here can be used with existing clinical instrumentation to detect tumors and potentially other types of inflammatory lesions to guide surgical decision making in real time.",eng,0

However, the actual dose to the skin does not agree well with the calculated dose by the treatment planning system because of the difference between the calculation condition and the real treatment condition (i.e., homogeneous water and full scatter condition vs contrast solution and lack of full scatter condition). In this study, the authors experimentally estimated dose discrepancies due to contrast and lack of full scatter in breast HDR brachytherapy with MammoSite. Using metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor detectors and a breast phantom, the dose discrepancies between the calculation and the treatment conditions were measured according to contrast concentration (10% and 20% volume ratios), balloon size (35 and 60 cm3), and source to detector distance ranging from 25 to 50 mm. The source was an Ir-192 isotope from Nucletron HDR unit. The dose discrepancies from the calculation condition due to both contrast and lack of full scatter combined ranged from about -1.4 +/- 2.5% to -18.2 +/- 2.0% in the studied cases (error bound is in two sided confidence interval of 80% based on Student's t distribution). In all cases, the effect of lack of full scatter was dominant to that of contrast and significant dose discrepancies existed between the calculation and the real treatment conditions, indicating that the actual skin dose is less than that which is currently calculated.",eng,0

In this study, we evaluated the ability of a novel intraoperative handheld gamma camera (IHGC) to image SLNs during surgery. METHODS: The IHGC is a small-field-of-view camera optimized for real-time imaging of lymphatic drainage patterns. Unlike conventional cameras, the IHGC can acquire useful images in a few seconds in a free-running fashion and be moved manually around the patient to find a suitable view of the node. Thirty-nine melanoma and eleven breast cancer patients underwent a modified SLN biopsy protocol in which nodes localized with the GP were imaged with the IHGC. The IHGC was also used to localize additional nodes that could not be found with the GP. RESULTS: The removal of 104 radioactive SLNs was confirmed ex vivo by GP counting. In vivo, the relative node detection sensitivity was 88.5 (82.3, 94.6)% for the IHGC (used in conjunction with the GP) and 94.2 (89.7, 98.7)% for the GP alone, a difference not found to be statistically significant (McNemar test, p = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Small radioactive SLNs can be visualized intraoperatively using the IHGC with exposure time of 20 s or less, with no significant difference in node detection sensitivity compared to a GP. The IHGC is a useful complement to the GP, especially for SLNs that are difficult to locate with the GP alone.",eng,0

We have previously presented our technical details (Annals of Surgical Oncology, 2007) of delivering partial breast irradiation with a single fraction of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) targeting the tumor in situ immediately prior to partial mastectomy. This study details our completed, single institution phase II trial, including local control rates. Methods: An IRB-approved, DSMB-monitored phase II trial was performed with the following inclusion criteria: women age 48 or older, ultrasound-visible invasive ductal cancers <3 cm, clinically negative axillary nodes. IORT was delivered using a mobile electron irradiator, including a 1.5-2 cm radial margin and a 1 cm deep margin, received 15 Gy and immediately underwent partial mastectomy. Ipsilateral breast recurrence was classified as true/marginal, elsewhere, or regional. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate survival functions and exact 95% confidence intervals are reported. Results: Between 2003 and 2007, 71 women underwent IORT with a median follow-up of 3.0 years. For patients with tumor-involved or close margins additional therapy was required, 7 patients underwent total mastectomy and 11 received whole breast radiation. Four women experienced pathologically confirmed invasive ipsilateral breast failures (1 new primary, 3 margin recurrences) for an actuarial three-year local control rate of 49/53 (94.8%; 95% CI: 84.2% - 98.3%). Three year adjusted overall survival for patients treated with only IORT was 91%, and breast cancer-specific survival was 100%. Conclusions: Intraoperative radiotherapy delivered to an in situ tumor is feasible, but our three-year local control rate is concerning. Possible changes to this technique to improve local control rates include better preoperative imaging (MRI) and improved IORT delivery (larger cone size, increased dose).",,0

Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is an APBI technique that delivers breast radiotherapy as a single dose at the time of partial mastectomy. We adapted the technique of Veronesi to deliver IORT prior to tumor excision to improve delivery to the region at risk and reduce the volume of normal tissue irradiated. Methods: Patients age >55 with ultrasonographically defined tumors <3 cm and invasive ductal carcinoma confirmed by core biopsy were eligible. Pre-operative ultrasound was performed at the time of needle localization and radiocolloid injection. IORT treatment planning was performed prior to surgery using ultrasound tumor definition, selecting cone size and electron energy to optimize dose distribution. In the operating room, the surgeon retracted the skin over the tumor, cone was placed and radiotherapy delivered. Standard partial mastectomy was then performed. Results: Twenty-three patients were enrolled in the study. Eighteen patients completed IORT with 10 patients having successful IORT no additional local therapy necessary. In five patients, the intraoperative radiation therapy served as the boost and in three patients unsuspected larger tumors or multicentric disease necessitated a mastectomy. The majority of patients had a good to excellent cosmetic result. Conclusions: Single fraction in situ IORT prior to partial mastectomy is feasible for patients with small breast cancers in achieving a good to excellent cosmetic result. Based on this early preliminary data, we plan to expand our feasibility trial. © 2006 Society of Surgical Oncology.",,1

Intraoperative frozen section analysis (FSA) is one method for margin evaluation. We retrospectively analyzed records of patients who received breast-conserving therapy with intraoperative FSA of the lumpectomy cavity to assess re-excision rates and local control. METHODS: Records were retrospectively reviewed for individuals who underwent breast-conserving surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma between 1993 and 2003. Inclusion criteria were a minimum of 2 years follow-up and intact tumor at the time of operation. The major outcome measure was local recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier test was used to evaluate local recurrence rates between groups. RESULTS: 290 subjects with an average age of 57.2 years (range 27-89) underwent 292 lumpectomies with FSA. 11.3% had DCIS, 73.3% had infiltrating ductal, 5.8% had infiltrating lobular, and 9.6% exhibited other forms of invasive carcinoma. 70 subjects underwent additional resection at the time of breast surgery, 16 underwent subsequent re-excision, and 17 underwent subsequent mastectomy. At a median follow-up of 53.4 months (range 5.8-137.8), there were six local recurrences (2.74%) in patients who had breast-conserving procedures and two local recurrences in patients who underwent mastectomy. There were no statistically significant associations among local recurrence rate, tumor size, nodal status, or overall stage. Local recurrences were higher in patients with DCIS compared with invasive carcinoma, and tumors >2cm. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative FSA allows resection of suspicious or positive margins at the time of lumpectomy and results in low rates of local recurrence and re-excision. The low local recurrence rate reported here is comparable to those reported with other margin assessment techniques.",eng,0

Song,2016.0,Reducing infection risk in implant-based breast-reconstruction surgery: challenges and solutions,10.2147/bctt.s97764,"Implant-based procedures are the most commonly performed method for postmastectomy breast reconstruction. While donor-site morbidity is low, these procedures are associated with a higher risk of reconstructive loss. Many of these are related to infection of the implant, which can lead to prolonged antibiotic treatment, undesired additional surgical procedures, and unsatisfactory results. This review combines a summary of the recent literature regarding implant-related breast-reconstruction infections and combines this with a practical approach to the patient and surgery aimed at reducing this risk. Prevention of infection begins with appropriate reconstructive choice based on an assessment and optimization of risk factors. These include patient and disease characteristics, such as smoking, obesity, large breast size, and immediate reconstructive procedures, as well as adjuvant therapy, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. For implant-based breast reconstruction, preoperative planning and organization is key to reducing infection. A logical and consistent intraoperative and postoperative surgical protocol, including appropriate antibiotic choice, mastectomy-pocket creation, implant handling, and considered acellular dermal matrix use contribute toward the reduction of breast-implant infections.",eng,0

Despite the lacking of mature Phase III clinical data, very recently both the American and European Societies for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO & ESTRO) have developed, independently, some recommendations providing a clinical guidance for the use of PBI outside the context of a clinical trial [1,2]. With some minor differences, ASTRO and ESTRO guidelines proposed the selection criteria to define a low-risk group of patients, suitable to be treated in clinical setting. Main characteristics are age over 50 years for ESTRO (60 years for ASTRO), small ductal carcinoma (up to 3 cm and up to 2 cm, respectively) and negative axilla, wide free margins, no additional pathological risk factors, such as extensive intraductal component, lympho-vascular invasion, BRCA mutation, and others and, of course, unifocal/unicentric disease. Among the different techniques used to perform PBI, IORT has increased rapidly in popularity, mainly in Europe. IORT allows to realize a high radiation dose to the index quadrant, eliminating the treatment to the tissue remote from the tumour bed, and using only one single session, as sole treatment (or anticipated boost). This may represent the possibility of overcoming some constraints such as the accessibility to the centres of radiotherapy, the socio-economic impact on the working life and on the personal habits of the patient. Another important advantage is the avoidance of the interactions with the systemic therapy, that may determine delays in the initiation or in the carrying out of the conventional treatment. These potential benefits must be balanced with the potential risk of recurrence within the untreated gland tissue in the same breast as well as the unknown long-term cosmetic results. A report of a randomized Phase III clinical trial, named TARGIT, even with still limited follow-up period, confirmed the equivalence in a low-risk group of patients of a intraoperative single dose of 20 Gy, given with low-energy X-rays, on the tumour bed only when compared with conventional postoperative approach [3]. In addition, the results of the nonrandomized ELIOT study from Milan using 21 Gy intraoperative electron beam identified a group of patients, based of detailed univariated and multivariated analyses, suitable for the treatment [4]. The comparison between the current standard for early stage breast cancer with early data coming from PBI and IORT techniques poses a dilemma as to when preliminary results are sufficiently mature to be allow practitioners and patients to consider a new treatment approach as safe. We know that most data from controlled and/or randomized of breast conservation therapy have demonstrated the importance of long-term data (up to 20 years) in determining the ultimate efficacy of a treatment. Pressure to consider the potential for PBI has come from within the radiation oncology community, as well as from surgeons, medical oncologists, and patients. Since up to now there were few study identifying groups of patients that would benefit from this new approach, the general recommendation is not to consider this technique as the therapeutic standard for all, but to limit the use to proper selected patients. For this reason, further mature data coming from the multi- or unicenter large phase III ongoing trials in US and Europe comparing standard irradiation with the different PBI/IORT schedules and techniques will hopefully support the movement into routine clinical practice. New issues of biology-oriented patient selection, imaging assessment for unifocal disease and target volume definition, and quality assurance program should be also addressed and defined in designing new generation of randomized trials.",,0

In contrast, the value of these parameters relative to local or local-regional recurrence is less well defined, and is still limited to an emerging area of research. Some studies have suggested an increased risk after breast conserving treatment in patients with the triple negative subtypes or HER2 positive, and a decreased risk in patients with luminal A tumours. This issue is really important to date considering the increasing role of tailored radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting after breast conservation surgery. An example are the various approaches of Partial Breast Irradiation (PBI), utilizing accelerated fractionated external beam radiation therapy or single dose intraoperative (IORT) or brachytherapy techniques, in which the potential benefits must be balanced with the potential risk of recurrence within the untreated gland tissue in the same breast. Since up to now there were few study identifying groups of patients that would benefit from this new approach, the general reccommendation is not to consider this technique as the therapeutic standard for all, but to limit the use to proper selected patients. Both the American (ASTRO) and European Societies for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) have developed, independently, some recommendations providing a clinical guidance for the use of PBI, including, in addition to standard patient and pathological characteristics, biological parameters.

The literature on PBI and breast cancer subtypes is evolving and still mixed, with no mature data. In a series of 1822 patients of the non-randomized ELIOT study from Milan using a single dose of 21 Gy intraoperative electron beam, a group of patients, stratified according the already mentioned recommendations, was confirmed to be at low risk for the partial breast treatment. The 5-year results of the in-breast reappearances for good candidates"", ""possible candidates"" and ""contraindications"" groups were 1.9%, 7.4% and 7.7%, respectively (p = 0.001) (GEC-ESTRO, Radiother Oncol, 2012), and for ""suitable"", ""cautionary"", and ""unsuitable"" groups were 1.5%, 4.4%, and 8.8%, respectively (p = 0.0003) (ASTRO, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 2012). Preliminary data coming from our randomized study, that will be presented, confirmed these stratifications. Some reports, relative to external accelerated PBI, also show differences in local or local-regional control rates in patients triple negative or ER negative, but this concern has not been demonstrated by others. The comparison between the current standard for early stage breast cancer with early data coming from PBI techniques poses a dilemma as to when preliminary results are sufficiently mature to be allow practitioners and patients to consider a new treatment approach as safe, knowing that most data from controlled and/or randomized of breast conservation therapy have demonstrated the importance of very long-term data in determining the ultimate efficacy of a treatment.

Intraoperative radiotherapy is a very attractive treatment modality in the multidisciplinary approach to breast conservation as is testified by the rapidly growing number of patients accrued in numerous studies all over Europe since 2000. A major advantage of intraoperative radiotherapy in breast cancer treatment is the administration of a large dose of radiation directly to the tumour bed, avoiding the possible geographic miss. Accurate localization and precise definition of the tumour bed volume is essential to achieve maximal efficacy in terms of local control while minimizing unnecessary damage to the normal breast tissue. Intraoperative radiotherapy reduces radiation exposure of the skin, lung, heart and normal subcutaneous tissues thus contributing to the low incidence of side effects and the generally excellent cosmetic results. Compared to other intraoperative techniques, the superiority of intraoperative radiotherapy appears to be the high homogeneity of dose distribution. The linear quadratic model used to calculate the biologic equivalent dose of intraoperative radiotherapy treatments for both tumour and normal tissue effects, is not considered totally reliable for large dose per fraction. The main concern is the potential increase in severe late side effects. Conversely, we expect an enhanced local control due to the radiobiologic efficacy of a large single dose delivered soon after tumour excision, with an immediate cell killing effect over any potential microscopic disease. The advantage of shortening the overall treatment time is that it avoids any delay in the administration of chemotherapy. The safety of intraoperative radiotherapy as a treatment modality in the context of breast conservation has been proved but conclusive data on local control and survival are expected from long term results of the ongoing studies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the feasibility of Peridose-software peripheral dose calculation in retrospective case-control studies. MATERIAL AND STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study on 12,630 patients who underwent adjuvant breast radiotherapy was performed. Minimum 5-year follow-up was required. Each index case was matched with 5 controls by 1) year of birth, 2) year of radiotherapy and 3) follow-up duration. Peridose-software was used to calculate peripheral dose. RESULTS: 195 second cancers were registered (19% [corrected] of all patients treated with adjuvant irradiation). Several methodological limitations of the Peridose calculation were encountered including impossibility to calculate the peripheral dose in the patients treated with intraoperative or external electron beam radiotherapy, in case of second tumors located at <15 cm from the radiotherapy field etc. Moreover, Peridose requires full radiotherapy data and the distance between radiotherapy field and second primary site. Due to these intrinsic limitations, only 6 index cases were eligible for dose calculation. Calculated doses at the second cancer site in index cases and in an analogous site in controls ranged between 7.5 and 145 cGy. The mean index-control dose difference was -3.15 cGy (range, -15.8 cGy and +2.7 cGy). CONCLUSIONS: The calculated peripheral doses were low and the index-control differences were small. However, the small number of eligible patients precludes a reliable analysis of a potential dose-response relationship. Large patient series followed for a long period and further improvement in the methodology of the peripheral dose calculation are necessary in order to overcome the methodological challenges of the study.",eng,0

International guidelines represent useful platform to collect data for continued refinement of patient selection, but the clinical applicability to APBI series showed some limitations, particularly among the intermediate and high-risk groups. The heterogeneity of APBI techniques, along with the heterogeneity of breast cancer, generates clinical results, where the predictive value of the histopathological factors can assume different weight. There is a need of further refinement and implementation of risk factors. Currently, the impact of breast cancer subtype on local control is matter of investigation, and treatment decision about radiotherapy is generally made without regard to the breast cancer subtype. However, receptor status information is easily available and some histopathological factors have not a definite role, there is no uniform interpretation. As molecular classification becomes more feasible in the clinical practice, it will provide added value to conventional clinical tumour characteristics in predicting local recurrence in breast cancer and may play an important role as predictor of eventual patient outcomes.",eng,0

A number of institutions have started to investigate the teasibility and safety at novel approaches in radiotherapy, modulating concomitantly treatment time and irradiation volume. Whilst this strategy is still under investigation, recent clinical studies on accelerated partial breast irradiation with intra-operative radiotherapy or high conformality irradiation strongly suggest that the way patients with early breast cancer are irradiated should be revisited. PBI can be carried out with different techniques. Three approaches are currently used: Intra-operative Radiotherapy (IORT), brachytherapy and high conformal external radiotherapy (EBRT). IORT consists of single-fraction treatment targeted at the tumor bed, during the surgical procedure, immediately after lesion removal. The solution adopted in most facilities practicing lORT is to employ mobile accelerators that can be brought to the operating room without the need of any major structural intervention for radioprotection issues but necessitating only of limited shielding. In modern IORT two kinds of beams are used: either megavoltage electrons or kilo voltage photons. Brachytherapy has been used for more than 30 years as a boost to complete WBI. More recently it has been used as sale modality in many PBI trials. Technically we can distinguish catheter based and balloon based approaches. In the former many catheters are inserted, either during surgery or in a SUbsequent phase. A balloon-based technique (MammoSite) has been developed to have a less operator-dependant procedure. MammoSite is a double lumen catheter with an inflatable balloon at the distal tip. It is inserted in the lumpectomy cavity during surgery or in a later stage and subsequently filled with saline and contrast material to displace all the tissue to be irradiated on the surface of the spherical applicator, being the radioactive source is placed in its centre. Compared to the single fraction approach of IORT, all the brachytherapy techniques offer a wider fractionation range. Brachytherapy moreover allows to wait for definitive pathology report and to benefit of a long dating radiobiological background, sounder than that existing for IORT. On the other side catheters can be a source of discomfort and can promote bleeding and infections. EBRT can of course be targeted to a single quadrant. This can be implemented with different techniques ranging from 3D-conformal RT with multiple static photons and/or electrons fields to intensity modulated radiation therapy to proton beam radiotherapy. The target volume must be contoured by the radiation oncologist on a simulation CT scan. All external beam techniques allow a more flexible choice of volumes to be irradiated and grant a more homogeneous dose distribution. Some special issues that may lead to a geographic miss must be addressed with EBRT: it may be difficult to precisely individuate the target volume and organ motion may playa relatively greater role Different doses and fractionation are used in EBRT PB. Historically the first trials of partial breast irradiation (PBI) have resulted in a sub-optimal local control, this has been due mainly to inadequate selections criteria and sub-optimal technique. Subsequent trials with appropriate selection criteria and careful quality assurance have resulted in local control rates comparable with those of whole breast irradiation. A number of tentative eligibility criteria can nowadays be delineated for PBI. The most often quoted are as follows: age 50+ years, histology non-lobular invasive carcinoma, without ductal carcinoma in situ (OCIS); tumor size <20 mm; nodal stage NO (MO); surgical margins 2+ mm. The data released in recent past studies on accelerated partial breast irradiation suggest that a change in treatment paradigm can be reasonably expected, at mid-term, for early disease management.",,0

Among different APBI techniques, intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is particularly appealing to patients and physicians, because the procedure is fast, convenient, normal structures sparing and able to solve some clinical problems, like the integration with chemotherapy. Early findings from phase II and randomized phase III trials show the approach of APBI in selected patients at low risk for local recurrence is safe and well tolerated, but short follow-up creates some reservations. Since recurrences of breast cancer can occur after a considerably time delay, final assessment of APBI will only be valid after sufficient follow-up from prospective randomized trials with large patients number. Until then APBI should be considered experimental. Furthermore, many questions regarding the appropriate patient selection criteria, treatment volume and dose fractionation still exist. In the context of risk-adapted RT, the key to success is the proper selection of the patients. Both the American and European Society of Radiology and Oncology provided a consensus statement regarding patient selection criteria based on tumour and patient-related features. The 5-year results of the non-randomized ELIOT study from Milan, using 21 Gy-full dose, identified a group of patients who may be good candidates for the treatment. The stratification of patients according to clinical phenotype or by molecular class and a widespread use of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging might be better identify patients eligible for APBI. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,0

Intraoperative radiotherapy has been used in the treatment of various malignancies, mostly in combination with external beam radiation therapy. The long-term results suggest a positive impact on local controls that appear to be associated with increased survival. Modern intraoperative radiotherapy can be performed either with electron beams or photons, and has been used recently in early-stage cancer as a boost or as an exclusive treatment, especially for breast tumors, with extremely promising results. The results of different clinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of the technique and it is expected that its application will become more widespread in the immediate future. Intraoperative electron radiotherapy in the treatment of initial-stage breast cancer may be an excellent alternative to external beam radiation therapy in an appropriate selected group of patients. However, intensive long-term follow-up is required for a better evaluation of local control and possible side effects. © 2006 Future Drugs Ltd.",,0

Sources can be either Low Dose Rate (LDR) or High Dose Rate (HDR) radionuclides or miniature x-ray units (electronic brachytherapy). Most recent experience has been with either conformal teletherapy at 2 Gy/fraction or MammoSite balloon brachytherapy at 3.4 Gy in 10 fractions. When balloon brachytherapy was first started with this 34 Gy regime, there was criticism that this dose was too low and that local control rates would not be as favorable as could be obtained with teletherapy. In this presentation we will use radiobiological principles to demonstrate that this previous conclusion that HDR balloon brachytherapy at 3.4 Gy in 10 fractions should be less effective for tumor control than conventional teletherapy was wrong. In order to determine the optimal dose to use for partial breast irradiation we account for repair and repopulation of cancer cells, the inhomogeneous dose distributions inherent with balloon brachytherapy, and the expected decrease in cancer cell density as a function of distance from the cavity surface. Finally, the radiobiological effectiveness of electronic brachytherapy sources will be discussed.",,0

In IOERT, an attenuation plate consisting of a pair of metal disks is commonly used to protect the normal tissues posterior to the breast. However, the dose in front of the plate is affected by backscatter, resulting in an unpredictable delivered dose to the tumour cells. In this study, an experimental attenuation plate, termed a shielding plate, was designed using Monte Carlo simulation, which significantly diminished the electron beam without introducing any backscatter radiation. The plate's performance was verified by measurements. It was made of two layers, a first layer (source side) of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and a second layer of copper, which was selected from among other metals (aluminium, copper and lead) after testing for shielding capability and the range and magnitude of backscatter. The optimal thicknesses of the PMMA (0.71 cm) and copper (0.3 cm) layers were determined by changing their thicknesses during simulations. On the basis of these results, a shielding plate was prototyped and depth doses with and without the plate were measured by radiophotoluminescence glass dosimeters using a conventional stationary linear accelerator and a mobile linear accelerator dedicated for IOERT. The trial shielding plate functioned as intended, indicating its applicability in clinical practice. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",,0

RESULTS: Patient compliance was excellent in both arms. Both WBI and APBI were well tolerated with moderate early side-effects. No grade 4 toxicity had been observed. Grade 3 side effects were exclusively seen for early skin toxicity (radiation dermatitis) with 7% vs. 0.2% (p<0.0001), and breast infection with 0% vs. 0.2% (p=n.s.) for patients treated with WBI and APBI.

Methods and Materials: Sixteen patients underwent CT scans before each treatment with accelerated partial breast irradiation. Before acquisition of CT scans for planning, each patient had a skin mark drawn to align with Lumen #1 (the Contura [SenoRx, Inc., Irvine, CA] has a black line on the shaft of the applicator to identify this lumen). In addition, a CT spot marker was used as a fixed reference point on the patient's skin. CT markers (used for lumen identification and reconstruction) were also used as additional reference points for distance measurements. The distances measured from the CT spot marker to the three reproducible points on the CT markers were used for balloon rotation verification. These measurements were performed for each daily fraction on reproducible CT axial views. Results: Three hundred eighteen measurements were obtained. Median residual rotation for all cases was 0.2. mm (standard deviation. =0.797). Later fractions and skin spacing changes over time were associated with slightly greater residual rotation (Fraction #1 vs. Fraction #10, 0.1 vs. 0.3. mm, p=0.05; and skin spacing change <2 vs. >2. mm, 0.2 vs. 0.5. mm, p=0.0019, respectively). Conclusions: These results confirm external alignment of a skin mark with Lumen #1 (on the Contura catheter) is an accurate and reliable method to align the balloon before treatment and that no significant internal device rotation (0.2. mm) is likely to occur. © 2011 American Brachytherapy Society.",,0

The radiation dose released to the index quadrant was more than 5 Gy/GBq, consistent with a boost of 20 Gy for an activity of 3.7 GBq 90Y-biotin (100mCi). A further large clinical trial facing IART in combination with reduced external-beam radiotherapy is, in our opinion, fully justified.""",eng,0

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To assess doses of 90Y-DOTA-biotin to target (i.e., breast tumor bed) and nontarget organs, we did simulation studies with 111In-DOTA-biotin in 10 candidates for conservative breast surgery. Immediately after quadrantectomy, patients were injected with 100-mg avidin in the tumor bed. On the following day, patients were given 111In-DOTA-biotin (approximately 111 MBq) i.v. after appropriate chase of biotinylated albumin (20 mg) to remove circulating avidin. Biokinetic studies were done by measuring radioactivity in scheduled blood samples, 48-h urine collection, and through scintigraphic images. The medical internal radiation dose formalism (OLINDA code) enabled dosimetry assessment in target and nontarget organs. RESULTS: Images showed early and long-lasting radioactive biotin uptake in the operated breast. Rapid blood clearance (<1% at 12 h) and urine excretion (>75% at 24 h) were observed. Absorbed doses, expressed as mean+/-SD in Gy/GBq, were as low as 0.15+/-0.05 in lungs, 0.10+/-0.02 in heart, 0.06+/-0.02 in red marrow, 1.30+/-0.50 in kidneys, 1.50+/-0.30 in urinary bladder, and 0.06+/-0.02 in total body, whereas in the targeted area, they increased to 5.5+/-1.1 Gy/GBq (50% ISOROI) and 4.8+/-1.0 Gy/GBq (30% ISOROI). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that Intraoperative Avidination for Radionuclide Therapy is a simple and feasible procedure that may improve breast cancer patients' postsurgical management by shortening radiotherapy duration.",eng,0

Lanza,2012.0,Rapid synthesis of near infrared polymeric micelles for real-time sentinel lymph node imaging,10.1002/adhm.201200087,"In this manuscript a synthetic methodology for developing sub 20 nm sized polymeric micellar nanoparticles designed for extravascular imaging and therapy is revealed. A simple, one-pot method is followed, which involves a rapid co-self-assembly of an amphiphilic diblock copolymer (PS-b-PAA) and polyoxyethylene (80) sorbitan monooleate in water. Sorbitan monooleate imparts stability to the micelles and helps to drive down the particle size below 20 nm. The particles are incorporated with a water soluble dye ADS832WS, which absorbs in the near infrared range (lambda(ex) = 832 nm) for sensitive detection with optical and photoacoustic imaging techniques. A candidate lipophilic anti-angiogenic therapeutic agent fumagillin was also incorporated with high entrapment (>95%) efficiency. The effectiveness of this theranostic platform for real-time, high-resolution intraoperative photoacoustic imaging for facilitating direct assessment of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in breast cancer staging is demonstrated. The technique offers huge potential providing faster resection of SLN and may minimize complications caused by axillary exploration due to mismarking with dyes or low-resolution imaging techniques. Finally, the biodistribution and organ accumulation of the intravenously and intradermally injected particles are studied in a rodent model by optical imaging. Data suggest that intraveneously injected NIR-polymeric nanoparticles follow a typical bio-distribution clearance path through the reticuloendothelial (RES) system. For the intradermally injected particles, a slower mechanism of clearance is noticed.",eng,0

However, the role of NSM is still controversial, mainly because of concern about the oncologic safety of the nipple-areola complex (NAC). INTRABEAM (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) is the most widely used mobile intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) device to date. This pilot study aims to broaden the application of the INTRABEAM system for breast cancer, investigating the feasibility of INTRABEAM IORT in NSM with breast reconstruction. Patients and Methods From December 2012 to June 2013, 7 female patients with breast cancer were enrolled in the study. NSM with or without axillary dissection was performed first. After confirming negative retroareolar frozen section results and no poor local bleeding in the NAC, INTRABEAM IORT was carried out with a single dose of 16 Gy, followed by breast reconstruction. The complications and short-term outcomes were assessed. Results The median radiation time was 13 minutes 14 seconds in the 7 cases. One patient complained of mild pain in the radiation field on the skin in the first 2 weeks. All 7 patients were followed for a median of 7 months. No acute radiation injury with symptoms (heart, lung, or hematologic system), NAC necrosis, local recurrence, or metastasis was observed. Although every patient had reduction in NAC sensitivity, the contours of the breasts (including the NAC) were satisfactory. Conclusions INTRABEAM IORT may be a feasible and convenient approach for NSM with breast reconstruction in patients with breast cancer. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,0

Rogers,2007.0,Medical hyperspectral imaging to facilitate residual tumor identification during surgery,", ","INTRODUCTION: Adequate evaluation of breast tumor resection at surgery continues to be an important issue in surgical care, as over 30% of postoperative tumors recur locally unless radiation is used to destroy remaining tumor cells in the field. Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) delivers near-real time images of biomarkers in tissue, providing an assessment of pathophysiology and the potential to distinguish different tissues based on spectral characteristics. METHODS: We have used an experimental DMBA-induced rat breast tumor model to examine the intraoperative utility of MHSI, in distinguishing tumor from normal breast and other tissues. Rats bearing tumors underwent surgical exposure and MHSI imaging, followed by partial resection of the tumors, then MHSI imaging of the resection bed, and finally total resection of tumors and of grossly normal-appearing glands. Resected tissue underwent gross examination, MHSI imaging, and histopathological evaluation. RESULTS: An algorithm based on spectral characteristics of tissue types was developed to distinguish between tumor and normal tissues. Tissues including tumor, blood vessels, muscle, and connective tissue were clearly identified and differentiated by MHSI. Fragments of residual tumor 0.5-1 mm in size intentionally left in the operative bed were readily identified. MHSI demonstrated a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 94% for detection of residual tumor, comparable to that of histopathological examination of the tumor bed (85% and 92%, respectively). CONCLUSION: We conclude that MHSI may be useful in identifying small residual tumor in a tumor resection bed and for indicating areas requiring more extensive resection and more effective biopsy locations to the surgeon.",eng,0

Sakelliou,2007.0,On the use of high dose rate 192Ir and 169Yb sources with the MammoSite radiation therapy system,10.1118/1.2760306,"Ample literature exists on the dose overestimation by commercially available treatment planning systems in MammoSite applications using high dose rate 192Ir sources for partial breast brachytherapy as monotherapy, due to their inability to predict the dose reduction caused by the radiographic contrast solution in the balloon catheter. In this work Monte Carlo simulation is used to verify the dose rate reduction in a balloon breast applicator which does not vary significantly with distance and it is 1.2% at the prescription distance for the reference simulated geometry of 10% diluted radiographic contrast media and 2.5 cm balloon radius. Based on these findings and the minimal hardening of the initially emitted photon spectrum for 192Ir, a simple analytical method is proposed and shown capable for correcting dosimetry planning in clinical applications. Simulations are also performed to assess the corresponding dose reduction in applications of balloon breast applicators using high dose rate 169Yb sources that have recently become available. Results yield a far more significant and distance dependent dose reduction for 169Yb (on the order of 20% at the prescription distance for the abovementioned reference simulation geometry). This dose reduction cannot be accounted for using simple analytical methods as for 192Ir due to the significant hardening of the initially emitted 169Yb photons within the diluted radiographic contrast media. Combined with results of previous works regarding the effect of altered scatter conditions (relative to treatment planning system assumptions) on breast treatment planning accuracy, which is more pronounced for 169Yb relative to 192Ir, these findings call for the amendment of dose treatment planning systems before using 169Yb high dose rate sources in balloon breast applicators.",eng,0

Mesko,1999.0,Intraoperative Ultrasound-Guided Excision of Nonpalpable Breast Lesions,", ","In order to determine if intraoperative ultrasound (US)-guided excision is a feasible procedure, we prospectively studied 15 female patients between July 1996 and December 1998 for US-detected nonpalpable breast lesions. Intraoperative US was used by the operating surgeon to identify the lesion, guide its excision, and evaluate the specimen to document complete removal. A control group of 15 female patients with mammographically detected nonpalpable lesions was used for comparison. These patients underwent preoperative needle localization, excision of the lesions, and specimen radiographs. Age, size of the lesion, total excised tissue volume, and operative time were documented in all cases. Fifteen patients aged 20-83 years (mean 51) underwent US-guided excision, which adequately localized all lesions, and excision was successful in all patients. Specimen US documented the lesion in all cases. Lesion size ranged from 0.7 to 2 cm (mean 1.1) and the total excised tissue volume averaged 30 cc. Mean operative time was 53 minutes (range 30-75 minutes). The 15 patients of the control group ranged in age from 32 to 82 years (mean 61). Excision was successful in all cases. Lesion size ranged from 1 to 2.5 cm (average 1.5) and the average excised tissue volume was 35 cc. Mean operative time was 50 minutes (range 30-75 minutes). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to age (p = 0.2), operative time (p = 0.5), and total excised tissue volume (p = 0.5). The size of the lesions did have a statistically significant difference (p = 0.01). There were no perioperative complications. In conclusion, US-guided excision of nonpalpable breast lesions is a feasible and effective technique. US documents results immediately, is of minimal discomfort to the patient, avoids the need for preoperative localization, allows the entire procedure to be performed in the operating room, does not require radiation, and provides the surgeon with a useful alternative in selected cases.",Eng,0

Luce,2012.0,Human acellular dermis versus no acellular dermis in tissue expansion breast reconstruction,10.1097/PRS.0b013e318262f06e,"BACKGROUND: Human acellular dermis has been adopted for routine use in tissue expander reconstruction. The purported benefits include higher intraoperative fill volume, facilitation of lower pole expansion, and enhanced definition of the lower pole of the breast. Recently, concerns have arisen about an increase in postoperative complications with its use. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who had immediate postmastectomy breast reconstruction with a tissue expander from July of 2001 to July of 2011. All tissue expander reconstructions before 2005 were performed submuscularly only and all subsequent to 2005 with the use of AlloDerm (LifeCell, Branchburg, N.J.) acellular dermis. Patient demographics were collected, and complications were recorded. RESULTS: The study cohort included 346 patients and 511 immediate breast reconstructions; 232 patients and 346 breasts were reconstructed with and 114 patients and 165 breasts without acellular dermis. Age, body mass index, diabetes, and tobacco use were equivalent in the two groups. Seroma occurrence in the acellular dermis group was nearly twice (30.0 versus 15.1 percent) that of the no acellular dermis breasts, but the tissue expander loss was only slightly higher (11.6 versus 8.5 percent) and not statistically significant. Body mass index in patients who lost their tissue expander was 31 kg/m, statistically significantly higher than in those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of acellular dermis did not increase the incidence of tissue expander loss, despite a doubling of frequency of seroma. Prior radiation and use of acellular dermis did culminate in a prohibitively high loss rate of the tissue expander.",eng,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients were treated postoperatively with HDR-BBB between May 2007 and December 2010. Median age was 71 years (range: 50-88 years). Median tumor size was 1 cm (range: 0.1-2.7 cm). Forty-four had invasive histology; 43% were grade 1, 24% grade 2, and 15% grade 3. The median margin size was 0.7 cm (range: 0.1-1.5 cm). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 2.9 years (range: 0.5-5.2 years), local control was 98% with one in-breast failure, and overall survival was 89%. Fifty percent of patients experienced fat necrosis. Seven patients were symptomatic, with the remainder detected by mammography alone. Two patients required surgical resection with pathology confirming fat necrosis; 1 required i.v. steroids. At 1, 3, and 5 years following treatment, estimated cumulative incidences of fat necrosis were 7.5%, 52.7%, and 60.6%. Breast laterality, location, tumor size, histology, margin size, balloon volume, skin distance, skin dose, and number of dwell positions were not significantly associated with fat necrosis on univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective review of HDR-BBB, we found a 50% incidence of both asymptomatic and symptomatic fat necrosis. Only three patients, however, required intervention. None of the risk factors considered were significantly associated with fat necrosis. Further studies evaluating factors associated with fat necrosis for patients undergoing HDR-BBB are necessary to appropriately assess the risks associated with treatment.",eng,0

Patient specific planning systems for this technique have not been previously available. Radiance virtual simulator has solved this limitation. This tool simulates the treatment in several steps: segmentation, by which the user can select regions to irradiate and regions to protect; applicator positioning using the CT image and 3D rendering to guide the process; parameter selection (applicator diameter, bevel angle and electron beam energy) by optimizing the Dose Volume Histograms (DVHs) on the different regions. The result of the process can be stored In a single file, allowing the comparison of different procedures. The purpose of this work Is to evaluate the tool in clinical cases by several radiation oncclogists (RO). Maferials: 14 cases, with a CT previous to IORT, were used for the evaluation. They Included the following locations: breast (3), rectal (6), rectal relapse (1), ovary relapse (1), pancreas (1), retroperitoneal (1) and Ewing sarcomas (f). All were simulated by three different ROs: R01 was an specialist with iong experienoe on IOERT procedures, and his simulations were used as a reference. R02 and R03 were less experienced users. CIInical history of the patient was provided with every case. Each evaluator segmented the regions of interest, placed the applicator and selected the treatment parameters in order to obtain the best dose coverage on the target volume. Concordance between users was evaluated for the following aspects: segmentation regions (qualitatively), treatment parameters (considering agreement when parameters were the same or within one step difference) and applicator position. Results: High agreement was found in the following cases: 3 breast and 3 rectal cancer, retroperitoneal sarcoma, rectal and ovary relapses. All ORs performed similar tumor and high risk areas segmentation. Parameter agreement was above 83%, and average applicator position difference was 1. 26 em (0. 6-2. 19). However, the remaining locations showed higher deviations in the results because of two main reasons: different criteria for segmenting high risk areas (1 rectal and 1 pancreas) and different surgical access simulated (2 rectal and 1 Ewing). (Figure presented). Conclusions: The results show that radiance tool can be used to simulate IOERT cases of different locations. The three ORs provided completely equivalent results for 65% of the cases evaluated. The results demonstrale that agreement in segmentation protocol, and information from the surgical procedure, are necessary to obtain equivalent simulations. This tool allows comparing the approaches from several users, and can be used to exchange experience between ORs with more and less experience, and also to discuss the surgical procedure with the surgeons.",,0

The lack of specific planning tools limits the spread of this technique. The purpose of the present study is to describe a new simulation and planning tool and its initial evaluation by clinical users. Methods and Materials: The tool works on a preoperative computed tomography scan. A physician contours regions to be treated and protected and simulates applicator positioning, calculating isodoses and the corresponding dose-volume histograms depending on the selected electron energy. Three radiation oncologists evaluated data from 15 IOERT patients, including different tumor locations. Segmentation masks, applicator positions, and treatment parameters were compared. Results: High parameter agreement was found in the following cases: three breast and three rectal cancer, retroperitoneal sarcoma, and rectal and ovary monotopic recurrences. All radiation oncologists performed similar segmentations of tumors and high-risk areas. The average applicator position difference was 1.2 +/- 0.95 cm. The remaining cancer sites showed higher deviations because of differences in the criteria for segmenting high-risk areas (one rectal, one pancreas) and different surgical access simulated (two rectal, one Ewing sarcoma). Conclusions: The results show that this new tool can be used to simulate IOERT cases involving different anatomic locations, and that preplanning has to be carried out with specialized surgical input. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The current state of the project, including details on its clinical use, is presented in this work. Materials: Development of the system started as an industrial and academic initiative in 2007 (GMV, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara and Hospital Provincial de Castellpain). The tool allows planning IOERT interventions from CT studies of a patient. Other modalities can also be used as complementary information. The planning process is as follows: 1) segmentation, user can select several regions to be considered organs at risk, structures to be removed during surgery, high relapse risk areas, bolus or protections; 2) simulation of patient positioning during surgery, accomplished by rotating the CT image, allowing virtual definition of the surgical frame; 3) selection of applicator parameters (diameter and bevel angle), and position; 4) selection of treatment energy with calculation of Dose Volume Histograms (DVHs) for the different regions. The DVHs are generated from dose distributions measured on a water phantom, but can also be estimated by means of a specific implementation of the Pencil Beam (PB) algorithm. This allows estimating the real interaction between radiation beam and patient anatomy or other objects. The pre-planning process includes interaction with the surgeons, who can indicate the expected surgical access and high risk areas in order to incorporate this information. Results: 41 patients have been evaluated, 33 retrospective and 8 prospective. The tumor types were: rectal and colon cancer (19), recurrences (6), sarcomas (8), breast cancer (5), pancreatic cancer (2) and chordoma (1). Clinical testing has proved feasibility of a) pre-tailoring IOERT target definition in agreement with surgical and radiotherapeutical individualized criteria; b) intra-surgically guided selection and optimization of pre-planning estimated parameters; c) post-planning definitive registration of the actual performed procedure for documentation and record. The system has proved the ability to integrate both radiotherapists and surgeons in the simulation and planning process. The stability of the current development has allowed the installation and clinical use of radiance systems in four hospitals in Spain (Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara, Clca La Luz, Hospital Provincial de Castellospital Ramajal). These centers are now collaborating in establishing new protocols for IOERT that involve simulation and planning with the presented tool. (Figure presented) Conclusions: This virtual pre-intra-post planning system reproduces the real radiosurgical process involved in IOERT, and includes now real dose modeling. Predictability of IOERT treatment decision process (including surgical and radiation treatment outcomes) is possible with this version of radiance. The multi-site collaboration will result in new guidelines for IOERT planning with this new approach.",,0

Using the American Society for Radiation Oncology criteria, 101 patients were suitable, 142 cautionary, and 52 patients were unsuitable. The average age was 65 with a range of 37 to 93. In our study, true local recurrence occurred in only 1.0% (n = 3). Patients recurring in the same breast elsewhere was 2% (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes after treatment with APBI were excellent, and breast recurrence was similar to whole breast irradiation.

Until 2011 a linear accelerator delivering high energy electron beam was used to treat approximately 130 patients. The first treatments with INTRABEAM system (Carl Zeiss SAS) using low energy X-rays were performed in October 2011. Materials and Methods: Nighty-four patients have now been treated with INTRABEAM. For each, the radiation dose required was 20 Gy to the surface of the surgical margin in a single fraction. The Intrabeam system produces low energy photons from a 50 kV and 40 muA source while preceding irradiation technique used electrons energy of 6 or 9 MeV. The isotropy of the low energy photon beam and the dose rate were measured before each treatment. Sterile applicators with variable diameters from 3 to 5 cm are selected to exactly fit the surgical cavity, thus allowing a homogeneous spherical irradiation. Results: With INTRABEAM, the dose attenuation is rapid (5 Gy at 1 cm from the applicator surface), thereby reducing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The mobile X-ray source is installed in one of two operating ambulatory surgery and does not require as before the immobilization of a radiotherapy bunker. The time needed to deliver the dose was between 20 and 53 min and depends on the size of the applicator. The total time needed for the room and the staff for the dose delivery step is not more important with Intrabeam system as before. Conclusion: The shift from breast intraoperative radiotherapy using a linear accelerator to Intrabeam was realized with no major problems in our institution. Using this new system has improved the workflow of radiotherapy and surgery, and thus increases the number of patients that can benefit from this technique.",,0

Palpable abnormalities are clinically apparent months after treatment and a vast majority of patients demonstrate seroma formation in radiologic studies. We embarked on this study to evaluate the actual sonographic incidence and eventual sonographic resolution, possible contributing factors, cosmesis, pain, and local control associated with seroma formation after MammoSite partial breast irradiation (PBI). We investigated 160 patients who underwent MammoSite PBI from 2002 to 2006 of whom 100 patients had serial sonographic information. Clinical and tumor variables, infection, pain, and cosmesis were investigated. Dosimetric data including volume of balloon, dose at balloon surface, and at skin were analyzed. After a median follow-up of 36 months, the incidence of sonographically confirmed post-radiation seroma was 78% within the first 1 year following radiation and steadily decreased with time. The average size of a seroma cavity was 2.3 cm (range 0.6-6 cm) with a decline to an average of 1.4 cm after 1 year, with complete resolution in 65% of patients at 2 years. No statistically significant correlation was found between patient characteristics, tumor variables, and volumetric or dosimetric data for seroma formation. Excellent/good cosmetic scores were achieved in 94% of women with and 92% without seroma. Local control was equivalent between patients with and without seroma.

This report provides 1- and 2-year updates to the initial publication. METHODS:: Patients were of age 50 years or more with invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor size <3 cm, and negative surgical margins. After lumpectomy, patients received EBT in 10 fractions over 5 days (34 Gy total). RESULTS:: Of the 69 patients enrolled, 62 were evaluated at 1 year and 20 patients at 2 years after treatment. At 1 year, 28 (45.2%) patients reported adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. Most (90%) were grade 1: manageable and typical of radiation therapy. Four events were grade 2: induration/firmness (2), field contracture (1), and seroma (1). One event was grade 3: a draining fistula at the lumpectomy site due to residual effects of a breast infection at 1 month. No recurrences have been reported. Cosmetic ratings were excellent or good in 93.4% of patients at 1 year. Most patients (69%) were energetic most or all of the time. Most patients (69% to 98%) were not affected by individual symptoms of breast disease at 1 year. Generally patients who had an adverse event did not report the corresponding symptom on the quality-of-life questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS:: This registry followed up patients with early-stage breast cancer at 1 and 2 years after breast-conserving surgery and EBT. No recurrences have been reported, and adverse effects were acceptable. Copyright © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,0
Journal Article,A. C. Paulino,2004.0,Late effects of radiotherapy for pediatric extremity sarcomas,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2004.02.001,"PURPOSE: To determine the long-term effects of radiotherapy (RT) in children treated for extremity sarcoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1964 and 1997, 15 of 33 children treated with RT for extremity sarcomas at the University of Iowa have survived with a median follow-up was 20 years (range, 6-36 years). There were 10 boys and 5 girls with a median age of 13 years (range, 3.5-20 years) at the time of irradiation. The diagnosis was Ewing's sarcoma in 8 (53%), synovial sarcoma in 4 (27%), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in 2, and fibrosarcoma in 1. Location of primary tumor was lower extremity in 10 (67%) and upper extremity in 5 (33%). RT was given as the definitive therapy for 9 children (median dose, 55.8 Gy; range, 45-66 Gy) and as an adjuvant postoperative treatment in 6 (median, 63 Gy; range, 41.4-66.4 Gy). (60)Co was used in 6 (40%), 4 mV in 4, 6 mV in 2, and 250 kV photons in 2 patients; 1 child was treated with a combination of 12 and 15 MeV electrons for a Ewing's sarcoma of the distal femur. Another child had a 25 Gy intraoperative RT boost after 41.4 Gy conventional RT. Late effects to the muscle, soft tissue, and growing bone were assessed using the objective portion of the LENT-SOMA scale proposed by the Late Effects Consensus Conference. RESULTS: Late effects were seen in all patients and included atrophy in 12 (80%), fibrosis in 12 (80%), bone growth abnormalities in 10 (67%), impairment of mobility and extremity function in 6 (40%), edema in 3 (20%), and peripheral nerve injury in 2 (13%). Ten of 15 (67%) children had Grade 1 or 2 growing bone, muscle, soft tissue, or peripheral nerve complications. Two patients (13%) had a Grade 3 mobility and extremity function score and had moderate to severe limitation of movement. Two children (13%) required epiphysiodesis because of a shorter treated leg. The patient who received an intraoperative RT boost of 25 Gy developed sensory dysfunction of the ulnar nerve 11 years after RT. Another developed radial nerve palsy 3 years after marginal resection and postoperative RT and required tendon transfer repair. One patient had radiation-induced vasculitis with popliteal artery thrombosis 23 years after RT. Five (33%) developed a fracture of the irradiated bone at a median time of 8 years after RT (range: 9 months to 22.2 years); all had Ewing's sarcoma, and 3 of these patients were subsequently found to have a secondary bone cancer (osteosarcoma 2, malignant fibrous histiocytoma 1) in the RT field. One of these patients also developed breast cancer 26 years after lung RT for metastatic Ewing's sarcoma. Overall, 11 surgical procedures in 8 children were performed to correct a limb preservation treatment toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Although most children treated with RT for a pediatric extremity sarcoma have minimal late toxicity by LENT-SOMA scale, approximately half required a surgical procedure to correct a late effect. A fracture in the irradiated bone may be the presenting sign or may precede a radiation-induced bone malignancy, as seen in 3 of the patients in this study.",eng,0

Kuerer,2004.0,Potential applicability of balloon catheter-based accelerated partial breast irradiation after conservative surgery for breast carcinoma,10.1002/cncr.11939,"BACKGROUND: Balloon catheter-based accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an alternative to whole-breast external-beam irradiation during breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for breast carcinoma, but it is limited by the size of the segmental mastectomy cavity. There are scant data on the average or optimal volume of resection (VR) in BCT. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the percentage of patients who would be eligible for balloon catheter-based APBI based on the selection criteria of the American Society of Breast Surgeons and the surgical VR. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 443 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma treated with BCT. Patient treatment and pathologic data were analyzed to assess VR and eligibility for APBI. RESULTS: BCT was performed for 178 patients with DCIS and 267 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. The majority of invasive carcinomas (63.3%) were infiltrating ductal carcinomas. The median overall lumpectomy volume was 67.61 cm3, with no significant difference between DCIS and invasive carcinoma (P>0.05). Although the majority (62.9-82.0%) of patients met the individual selection criteria for APBI, only 27.4% of the cohort was found to be eligible for any type of APBI when the selection criteria were considered together. Based on VR, only approximately one-half of the patients initially eligible for APBI would be candidates for immediate balloon catheter-based APBI using the 70 cm3 balloon device (13.3%). However, with the new, larger 125 cm3 balloon device, approximately three-fourths of patients initially eligible for APBI would be eligible for balloon catheter-based APBI at the time of the initial surgical procedure (20.7%). Although not evaluated in the current study, shrinkage of the lumpectomy cavity with time may increase the number of patients eligible based strictly on VR criteria. Patients with a very large VR (> or =125 cm3) were more likely to have invasive carcinoma (P=0.02; hazard ratio [HR], 7.4) and tumors > or =5 cm on final pathology (P<0.01; HR, 22.0). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-fifth to one-fourth of patients presenting for BCT may be eligible for balloon catheter-based APBI according to accepted national guidelines and VR. VR must be considered when selecting patients for balloon catheter-based APBI, because a minority of patients will have a lumpectomy cavity that exceeds the size limit of the current balloon device.",eng,0

Williams,2014.0,Dose modification factor analysis of multilumen balloon brachytherapy applicator with Monte Carlo simulation,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&AN=602137257","The Contura brachytherapy applicator is a silicone balloon with five lumens in which a high-dose-rate brachytherapy source can traverse. Multilumen applicators, like the Contura, are used in accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) brachytherapy in instances where asymmetric dose distributions are desired; for example, when the applicator surface-to-skin thickness is small (< 7 mm). In these instances, the air outside the patient and the lung act as a poor scattering medium, scattering less dose back into the breast and affecting the dose distribution. The recent report by Task Group 186 of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) has outlined the importance of moving towards brachytherapy dose calculations using heterogeneity corrections. However, at this time, many commercial treatment planning systems do not correct for tissue heterogeneity, which can result in inaccuracies in the planned dose distribution. To quantify the deviation in the skin dose we utilize the dose modification factor (DMF), defined as the ratio of the dose rate at 1 cm beyond the applicator surface with homogenous medium, to the dose rate at 1 cm with heterogeneous medium. This investigation models the Contura applicator with the Monte Carlo N-Particle code version 5, and determines a DMF through simulation. Taking all geometrical considerations into account, an accurate model of the Contura balloon applicator was created in MCNP and used to run simulations. The dose modification factor was found to be only slightly dependent on whether the dose distribution was symmetric or asymmetric. These results indicate that the dose delivered to part of the PTV may be lower than the planned dose by up to 12%, and that these brachytherapy plans should be viewed with caution. In addition to studying the effects of backscatter, an evaluation was made regarding the capabilities of the Contura device to shape an asymmetric dose distribution. We compared these results to a previous study of a MammoSite ML and a SAVI device and found that the dose shaping capabilities of the Contura were quite similar to that of the MammoSite ML, but markedly inferior to the SAVI.",,0

Aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of surgical resection volume and intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) on locoregional recurrence (LR) in patients treated with breast conservation. Methods We analyzed data from 208 consecutive patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy after NAT for locally advanced breast cancer. Of those, 108 patients received IORT followed by whole-breast irradiation and 50 patients had conventional radiotherapy (whole-breast irradiation and boost). Surgical resection volumes (RV) were calculated and categorized as small or large RV. Locoregional recurrence rates (LRR) were calculated in association with resection volume and type of radiotherapy. Results After a median follow-up of 6.4 years locoregional recurrence (LR) was observed in a total of 19 patients (9%) and in-breast recurrence in 6 patients (2.9%). The median RV was 110 cm<sup>3</sup>. Overall, recurrence rates were not statistically significant after small- (<110 cm<sup>3</sup>) vs large- (>110 cm<sup>3</sup>) resection-volume surgery (p = 0.47). LRR was significantly higher in patients <50 years old (p = 0.009) and in triple-negative breast cancer subtype (p = 0.001). The 5-year outcome after pathological complete response (pCR) was excellent irrespective of the extent of surgery. In patients with considerable residual disease, higher recurrence rates were observed but this was not associated to the extent of surgical resection (1% LRR for small RV vs 3% LRR for large RV). LRR after breast-conserving surgery followed by IORT was only 8%, not significantly different compared to patients treated with conventional radiotherapy (12%) (p = 0.29). For patients with considerable residual disease treated with IORT, there was no significant difference in LRR in comparison to patients receiving conventional radiotherapy (2.4% vs 1.4%). Conclusion Less aggressive surgery and the use of intraoperative radiotherapy are associated with a low locoregional recurrence rate and may be considered as an option for local treatment after NAT.",,0
Journal Article,H. J. Peiper,1998.0,Acute psychological care by the operating surgeon,", ","The diagnosis of breast cancer causes severe psychological conflicts. This is because of the sudden need for a mutilating breast operation and because of the threatening confrontation with a potentially lethal disease. The consequence can be a spectrum of physical and mental sequelae, access to which the physician may find difficult. Here, the interpersonal relationship between the patient and the operating surgeon is of particular relevance, not only for the hospital phase but also in the time to follow. These effects therefore fall into the sector of psychosocial care. Within this framework, an improvement of the postoperative quality of life may be the result, probably via emotional processes. Various recent studies have confirmed the empirical finding that this care may result in an extension of the survival time. The acute psychological care by the operator involves: diagnostic, response to diagnosis, decision making of the patient, informed consent, the perioperative phase, postoperative information and the further decision making"" because of the operative findings, and discussion at the time of discharge. In connection with the informed consent there are several points of a heavy psychological load; namely, the likelihood of the diagnosis, the problem of the intraoperative histology and their consequences, procedure modalities, the possibility of a one-stage- or two-stage-operation, the meaning of the type of incision, the consequences and need for a lymph node excision, information about possible complications, discussion about postoperative treatment modalities, the prognosis and finally of psychological points of view. The influence of the surgeon is in this regard is of great importance. Especially as concerns the alternatives of tumorectomy with radiation and mastectomy (without radiation) and possible reconstruction. Other problems are connected to possible adjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy and perhaps bone marrow transplantation. Alternative conservative therapeutic modalities are, also of special interest.""",eng,0
Journal Article,N. Pepe; P. Pepe; D. Carni,1999.0,"[Breast reconstruction: a possible balance between oncological therapy, reconstructive methods and the patients]",", ","BACKGROUND: Based on their experience of oncological surgery and wishing to respond to the patients' reconstructive requirements, the authors analyse the damage caused by medical therapy (chemo-hormone therapy and radiotherapy) in terms of reconstructive techniques; they aim to establish whether the tissues used in reconstruction interfere with the diagnosis and treatment of recidivations and to identify the best reconstructive strategy in relation to timing""; lastly, they examine the possibility of realising a cosmetically improved breast. METHODS: A 2-year retrospective study was made during which 3 patients underwent immediate reconstruction using expanders (including 2 with bilateral reconstruction) and 1 patient underwent postradiotherapy differed reconstruction; all patients were followed up for a maximum of 4 years. The following surgical methods were used to improve cosmetic results: 1) conservation of the pectoralis minor which was turned sideways to create the muscular pocket; 2) costal and sternal disinsertion of the pectoralis major; 3) the implant was covered with the muscular pocket in the upper quadrants and with subcutaneous tissue in the lower quadrants; 4) realisation of a mammary groove; 5) immediate mastopexy of the surviving breast. All patients underwent intraoperative and postoperative polychemotherapy. RESULTS: At present (January 1997) none of the patients treated shows signs of locoregional recidivation or general metastases. Complications were observed in the form of subacute infection of the prosthetic flap exposing the expander and infection of the suture material used to reshape the breast in contralateral mastopexy in the patient undergoing reconstruction after radiotherapy. When evaluating the cosmetic results, scar diastasis varied in all patients. Smoothing of the scars, slight implant distortion observed echographically, grade 2 contraction of the periprosthetic capsule were assessed using Baker's scale and all patients were found to be grade I or II. In the light of these results and their personal experience, the authors then analyse, with reference to the literature, the effect of radiotherapy on reconstruction using tissular expansion, the effect of chemotherapy on reconstruction using expansion or autologous implants; the combined effect of radio and chemotherapy on reconstruction using autologous implants or tissues. Timing and the difficulty of diagnosis locoregional recidivation are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The authors fully agree with the need to carry out immediate reconstruction, when indicated (above all in bilateral reconstruction) using implants since it is simpler. Chemotherapy does not interfere with the expansion process whereas, if it is deemed necessary to use radiotherapy, it is certainly better to undertake reconstruction using autologous tissues. For special reconstruction methods (replacement of the expander, differed reconstruction with expander), greater use should be made of the day hospital, or better still office surgery.""",ita,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Identical plans were prepared for three computational models using two commercially available systems and the same (192)Ir source. Reference dose distributions were obtained for each plan using the MCNP v.6.1 Monte Carlo (MC) simulation code with input files prepared via automatic parsing of plan information using a custom software tool. The same tool was used for the comparison of reference dose distributions with corresponding MBDCA exports. RESULTS: The single source test case yielded differences due to the MBDCA spatial discretization settings. These affect points at relatively increased distance from the source, and they are abated in test cases with multiple source dwells. Differences beyond MC Type A uncertainty were also observed very close to the source(s), close to the test geometry boundaries, and within heterogeneities. Both MBDCAs studied were found equivalent to MC within 5 cm from the target volume for a clinical breast brachytherapy test case. These are in agreement with previous findings of MBDCA benchmarking in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The data and the tools presented in this work, that are freely available via the web, can serve as a benchmark for advanced clinical users developing their own tests, a complete commissioning procedure for new adopters of currently available TPSs using MBDCAs, a quality assurance testing tool for future updates of already installed TPSs, or as an admission prerequisite in multicentric clinical trials.",eng,0

Our method was developed as part of our Phase I/II pilot study of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy alone after conservative surgery for early breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In March 1992, we started a pilot study of HDR brachytherapy to the lumpectomy site as the sole radiotherapy after conservative surgery for clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer. Initially, the protocol required intraoperative placement of the interstitial needles at the time of definitive surgery to the breast. The protocol was then generalized to allow the implantation of the lumpectomy site after definitive surgery to the breast, either at the time of subsequent axillary nodal dissection or postoperatively. To date, five patients have been implanted intraoperatively at the time of definitive breast surgery. Twelve patients were implanted after definitive breast surgery, with 7 patients being done at the time of axillary nodal dissection and 5 patients postoperatively. We devised a method of accurately localizing and implanting the lumpectomy site after definitive breast surgery. The method relies on the previous placement of surgical clips by the referring surgeon to mark the lumpectomy site. For each patient, a breast mold is made with radio-opaque angiocatheters taped onto the mold in the supero-inferior direction. A planning CT scan is then obtained through the lumpectomy site. The volume of the lumpectomy site, the number of implant planes necessary, and the orientation of the implants are then determined from the CT scan. The angiocatheters provide a reference grid on the CT films to locate the entry and exit points of the interstitial needles on the plastic mold. The entry and exit points for reference needles are then transferred onto the patient's skin enabling implantation of the lumpectomy site. Needle positions with respect to the lumpectomy site are then verified using simulator radiographs. RESULTS: Eight double plane implants and four single plane implants have been done using this method. Five implants were done using direct visualization. It has not been necessary to reorient the implant in any of the patients. If not for the presence of surgical clips, the size of the lumpectomy site cannot be separated from the surrounding normal breast tissue. CONCLUSION: This technique is an accurate way to localize the lumpectomy site for HDR brachytherapy.",eng,0

We have tested the feasibility of outpatient high dose rate brachytherapy to the primary tumor bed as the only radiation. Our technique relies on the placement of surgical clips to mark the tumor bed. METHODS: Between March 1992 and January 1996, 39 patients with clinical T1 T2 breast cancer were enrolled in this pilot study. The first 13 patients had intraoperative implantation of the breast. The remaining 26 patients had outpatient postoperative implantation under general anesthesia (2 patients) or local anaesthesia (24 patients). High dose rate brachytherapy was given twice daily at least 6 hours apart for a total dose of 37.2 Gy in 10 fractions over 5-7 days. RESULTS: Three patients had mild clinical cellulitis responding to oral antibiotics. One patient had a small sinus in the lumpectomy scar requiring local excision to heal. Four patients developed fat necrosis at the lumpectomy site at 4 (1 patient), 13 (1 patient), and 18 months (2 patients) post radiotherapy. Patient rated satisfaction with treatment was high. At a median followup of 20 months, one infield local recurrence has been salvaged by wider resection and postoperative conventional external beam radiation.

METHODS: Between March 1992 and January 1996, 39 patients with T1 (32 patients) and T2 breast cancers received 37.2 Gy in 10 fractions (b.i.d.) over 1 week prescribed to a volume encompassing the surgical clips. Thirteen received adjuvant tamoxifen, and 4 received chemotherapy. Follow-up included annual bilateral mammograms and clinical breast examination every 3 to 6 months. Whereas 13 patients had intraoperative implantation of the lumpectomy site, 26 had postoperative implantation. The latter group and 7 of the former group had surgical clips marking the lumpectomy site, which allowed estimates of the distance of any ipsilateral breast recurrence from the lumpectomy site, using the mediolateral and cranio-caudad mammographic views. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 91 months, 33 women are alive, 4 have died of disease, and 2 have died of other causes. The 5-year actuarial rate of ipsilateral breast recurrence was 16.2%. Of 6 ipsilateral recurrences, 2 occurred within the lumpectomy site (in-field recurrences). One of the 2 patients had a 1-mm microscopic margin at initial diagnosis; the recurrence was a 3.5-mm microscopic focus of duct carcinoma in situ. The other patient had a 1.5-cm, high-grade infiltrating mammary carcinoma with no residual at wider resection at first diagnosis; the 5-mm invasive recurrence was also of high grade. Four women developed invasive recurrences at least 1.6 cm or more from the lumpectomy site (out-of-field recurrences). Two of these women had gross multifocal recurrences with two cancers in each patient; 1 of the 2 patients had an extensive intraductal component at initial diagnosis. The estimated nearest distances between the out-of-field recurrences and the surgical clips were 1.6, 5.5, 7.7, and 12.0 cm. All ipsilateral breast recurrences were salvaged by mastectomy (4 patients) or by repeat lumpectomy (2 patients) and whole-breast radiation. The interval postdiagnosis to ipsilateral recurrence ranged from 20 months to 58 months. There were two contralateral breast recurrences at intervals of 34 and 36 months; 1 of these patients also had a multifocal, ipsilateral recurrence at 58 months, as previously described. Among patients with any breast recurrence, 1 patient had a family history of prostate cancer; there was no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Of 17 patients who received adjuvant systemic therapy, only 1 had a breast recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, breast recurrences outside of the lumpectomy site were the predominant pattern of recurrence.",eng,0

Initially, and for many years brachytherapy was more of an Art: 226Ra needles or sources in rudimentary applicators (cylinders) 'were inserted in the tumor and dose prescription was empirical'. Pioneers in Radiation Oncology designed applicators to achieve better dose distributions. Afterloading devices with selective shielding, and flexible catheters, initially loaded manually and later through remote devices provided welcome radiation safety protection. Our colleagues in Physics established dosimetry procedures and rules to more accurately determine radiation doses (Patterson Parker, Quimby, the Paris dosimetry methodology). 226Ra has been replaced by other radionuclides with more appealing physical characteristics (energy, specific radioactivity, half life, etc) and safety for the patients and the operator, such as 137Cs, 192Ir, 169Yb, 241Am and others. Innovative technology has advanced brachytherapy into more scientific grounds. Sophisticated computational methods and imaging (ultrasound, CT scanning, etc) enhanced our ability to do more precise 3D treatment planning and increased our capabilities for dosimetry verification. Recently MRI and PET scanning have allowed precise identification of target volumes and rapid imaging plus robust computational techniques have made it possible to carry out real time image-guided 3D/4D volumetric dose optimization (inappropriately called 'dose painting', which would apply to a surface). Radiation Biology investigation has also contributed to advance the scientific basis of brachytherapy. With better understanding of the cellular kinetics and the acute and late effects of radiation in normal tissues it was possible to introduce different dose rate devices into clinical practice, and in many countries the traditional Low Dose Rate (LDR) has been progressively replaced by Mid- or High Dose Rate (MDR, HDR) techniques, with substantial reduction in cost of treatment and improved radiation safety for providers and patients. Pulsed Dose Rate combines the technological advantages of HDR with the biological effects of LDR. Recently low keV x-ray electronic brachytherapy systems have been introduced, with specific applications, such as partial breast irradiation. These modalities , combined with sophisticated treatment planning algorithms, enhance the flexibility for 3D dose modulation and optimization, by manipulating source dwelling times and patterns. Relative-dose-homogeneity Index, Dose non-uniformity Ratio and Conformality Index are tools quite useful to achieve dose optimization. Modern brachytherapy represents in many respects a classic mode of conformational adaptive radiation therapy. Cloud computing will facilitate real-time planning and dose optimization, enhancing the precision in dose delivery. Whereas brachytherapy continues to be a mainstay in the treatment of carcinoma of the uterine cervix and other gynecological tumors, there has been a major increase in the application of permanent seed implants (125I, 103Pa) or HDR in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer, with results equivalent to radical prostatectomy or advanced external beam techniques. On the other hand, a reduction in the use of brachytherapy in the treatment of patients with cancer of the head and neck has taken place. Breast brachytherapy has been re-enacted with the introduction of accelerated partial breast irradiation, the efficacy and safety of which is being tested in several clinical trials. As in any aspect of radiation therapy, quality assurance, safety, protection and compliance with all regulatory requirements are critical to the appropriate use of brachytherapy. There is a critical need to emphasize the teaching of brachytherapy in Radiation Oncology Residency programs and to fost r prospective clinical trials to expand its role in the management of many patients with cancer.",,0

In 342 patients with Stage T1 and 107 with Stage T2 tumors, boost to the primary tumor excision site was delivered with 9 MeV and, more frequently, with 12 MeV electrons. In 91 patients with Stage T1 and 38 patients with Stage T2 tumors an interstitial 192Ir implant was performed. Tumor control, disease-free survival, cosmesis, and morbidity of therapy are reviewed. Minimum follow-up is 4 years (median 5.6 years; maximum, 24 years). RESULTS: The overall local tumor recurrence rates were 5% in the T1 and 11% in the T2 tumor groups. There was no significant difference in the breast relapse rate in patients treated with either electron beam or interstitial 192Ir boost. Regional lymph node recurrences were 1% in patients with T1 and 5% with T2 tumors. Distant metastases were recorded in 5% of the T1 and 23% of the T2 groups. The 10-year actuarial disease-free survival rates were 87% for patients with T1 and 75% with T2 tumors. Disease-free survival was exactly the same in patients receiving either electron beam or interstitial 192Ir boost. Cosmesis was rated as excellent/good in 84% of patients with T1 tumors treated with electron beam and 81% of patients treated with interstitial implant, and 74 and 79% respectively, in patients with T2 tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Breast-conservation therapy is an effective treatment for patients with T1 and T2 carcinoma of the breast. There is no difference in local tumor control, disease-free survival, cosmesis, or morbidity in patients treated with either electron beam or interstitial 192Ir implant boost. Clinical trials in progress will further elucidate this controversial subject.",eng,0

Gil Gil,2010.0,Avoiding axillary treatment in sentinel lymph node micrometastases of breast cancer: a prospective analysis of axillary or distant recurrence,", ","BACKGROUND: The need for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) micrometastases remains controversial. The aims of the study were to evaluate the locoregional failure and outcome of breast cancer patients with sentinel node micrometastases who did not undergo completion ALND. METHODS: Between November 2000 and December 2006, SLN biopsy was successfully performed in 1178 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Only patients with macrometastasis (>2 mm) underwent ALND, while patients with negative SLN or micrometastases did not undergo further treatment of the axilla, by either surgery or radiotherapy. Regarding adjuvant therapy decision, patients with SLN-micrometastases (pN1(mi)) were considered as node-positive patients. RESULTS: Of 1,178 patients, 59 (5%) had micrometastases. Of those with micrometastases, 14 (24%) underwent ALND because the intraoperative study of the SLN yielded a positive result. With a median follow-up of 60 (range, 8-94) months, none of the patients with SLN micrometastases in whom ALND was omitted developed an axillary recurrence, while one patient in whom ALND was performed developed infraclavicular lymph node recurrence. One patient, who declined postoperative breast irradiation, developed breast recurrence and distant metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer patients with SLN micrometastases in whom ALND was omitted had a very low locoregional failure rate. This study supports the theory that ALND might be avoided in these patients, providing that adjuvant systemic treatment equal to treatment provided to treat node-positive disease is administered. However, longer follow-up and results of additional prospective studies are needed.",eng,0

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is referred to as the delivery of a single high dose of irradiation directly to the tumor bed during surgery. We evaluated the feasibility and safety of a combined approach in patients affected by early breast cancer and breast ptosis. Materials and Methods: We selected 5 patients that were affected by low risk early breast cancer (> 45 y.o., invasive ductal carcinoma with intraductal component ociated with breast conservation surgery for breast cancer. In our opinion this technique allows a large exposure of breast gland that facilitates the preparation of glandular flaps that will be treated with IORT. In addition, the combined use of this two techniques overcomes the problem of postoperative localisation of tumoral bed, because radiotherapy is given during surgery. Contralateral adjustment can be carried out immediately or delayed. Long term follow up will be necessary to validate oncological and aestetic results. Conclusion: Preliminary results encourage us to believe that the association between these two techniques is not only feasible but also safe and acceptable by patients for good aesthetic results. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the long-term efficacy of IORT in local control of breast cancer.",,0

Goy,2011.0,Clinical radiobiology of partial breast irradiation,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed13&AN=70548195","During the last decades, the conceptual approach to breast cancer treatment has shifted from radical mastectomy to local treatment that preserves the breast and axillary lymph nodes along with adjuvant systemic therapy. Breast-conserving surgery followed by postoperative whole breast external beam radiotherapy is now the standard of care for suitable patients with early breast cancer. External beam radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment; the risk of side-effect is low. However, despite its many positive benefits, radiation therapy is also associated with some disadvantages, the foremost of which is perhaps the fact that it is a relatively complex and expensive treatment. Although many studies have failed to identify a subgroup of patients in whom radiotherapy can be completely avoided, whether irradiation of the whole breast is necessary in all or a subgroup of patients remains unclear. An important rationale for considering less than whole-breast treatment concerns the patterns of breast tumour recurrence in patients treated with breast conservation without adjuvant radiation therapy. Data from clinical trials suggest that of the 30% of patients who experience breast tumour recurrence when radiation therapy is not delivered, the vast majority (approximately 80%) will have the recurrence develop at the site of the original disease. In addition, the absolute percentage of recurrences that develop in a location far away from the tumour bed ist low, ranging from 3% to 5%. From these data, many researchers have hypothesized that treatment directed solely to the site of the primary tumour may be adequate. Therefore, partial breast irradiation (PBI) utilizing irradiation of the tumour bed with an associated margin in early breast cancer patients is being investigated. A number of methods of PBI exist: 1) External-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) 2) Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) 3) Brachytherapy. Irrespective of modality, the majority of treatments are prescribed using hypofractionated accelerated courses, which are termed accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Determining the dose used and the expected toxicity for each modality requires knowledge of the radiobiologic concepts of both the tumour and the technique used. Understanding the radiobiological principles behind the different APBI techniques enables a more informed prediction of disease control and toxicity and enables quantitative comparisons between techniques and regimens. Patients vary in their response to a specific course of radiation. In the future, translational research may give us the ability to identify genotypic and phenotypic factors, which may enable us to predict which APBI technique may prove more suitable for an indivual patient.",,0

Breast-conserving surgery has become the standard approach for about 80% of patients treated for primary breast cancer in most centres. However, mastectomy is still required in case of multicentric and/or large tumours or where recurrences occur after conservative treatment. When a total mastectomy is performed, the removal of the nipple areola complex (NAC) is a strongly debated issue. In fact, although removal of the NAC greatly increases the patient's sensation of mutilation, and the risk of tumor involvement of the areola is reported as a very variable percentage, NAC excision still remains the standard treatment. Patients and methods. From March 2002 to September 2003, 106 nipple sparing mastectomies (NSM) were peformed in 102 patients, 63% of whom had invasive carcinoma and 37% of whom had in situ carcinoma. Four patients underwent bilateral surgery. In all cases, a large or multicentric tumour and/or diffuse microcalcifications, clinically distant from the NAC, were present. During surgery, the tissue under the areola was routinely sampled to exclude the presence of tumor. If disease-free at the frozen sections, the NAC was spared and a NSM was performed. Additionally, a total dose of 16 Gy of radiotherapy (ELIOT) was delivered intraoperatively in the region of the NAC. All the patients underwent an immediate plastic breast reconstruction. Results. In eleven patients (10.4%), the breast tissue under the areola resulted infiltrated at the definitive histological examination: in 10 cases a single or multiple foci of in situ carcinoma and in one case an invasive component were present. Eleven patients (10.4%) developed a superficial skin areolar slough followed by spontaneous healing, and 5 patients (4.7%) lost their NAC due to total necrosis. Among these, one patient had a poor cosmetic result on the NAC with asymmetrical location and required further surgical removal and reconstruction with tattoo and local flap in a better position. When rating the results from 0 (bad) to 10 (excellent), on average, the colour of the areola was rated 9/10, the sensitivity of nipple 3/10, the overall aesthetic result was rated 8/10 by both the surgeon and the patients. Early radiodystrophy (pigmentation) was observed in eight cases (7.5%). After an average follow up of 13 months, one local recurrence, located under the clavicula, far from the NAC, was observed. The preliminary results of the psychological study show a very high satisfaction with the preservation of the nipple (97.6 %), with younger women expressing a higher satisfaction than older counterparts. Conclusions. In selected cases, NSM with ELIOT of NAC has so far permitted good local control of the disease and satisfactory cosmetic results. Wider surgical experience is required to minimise the risk of leaving tumor cells in the region of the spared NAC and a longer follow up is necessary to evaluate the long term tumor recurrence rate at the NAC. © Springer 2005.",,0

The removal of the nipple areola complex during the mastectomy dramatically increases the feeling of mutilation. To reduce this negative psychological impact, in cancers located outside of the central area of the breast, we propose a new type of nipple-sparing mastectomy associated with intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy (ELIOT) delivered on the region of the areola. The nipple-sparing mastectomy is performed leaving 5 mm of glandular tissue behind the nipple areola complex to preserve its blood supply. The reconstruction is immediately performed with a prosthesis or an autologous flap. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients were included in the study; two of them had a bilateral nipple-sparing mastectomy. RESULTS: Pathological examinations demonstrated the presence of 19 infiltrating carcinomas and 8 ductal carcinoma in situ. Two patients had a superficial skin areolar slough followed by spontaneous healing. One necrosis of the areola occurred due to extensive retroareolar dissection. In the early follow-up, the color of the areola was preserved. All patients except one expressed their satisfaction of having kept their areola. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results are encouraging but they require further studies to evaluate the long-term results, the local recurrence rate and the psychological impact.",eng,0

The risk of local recurrence behind the nipple areolar complex (NAC) is the main limiting factor of the NSM procedure. To minimize such risk, we proposed in 2002 a intraoperative radiotherapy of the preserved NAC. Patients and methods From March 2002 to November 2006, 579 cases (in 570 patients) of NSM were performed for carcinoma. The median follow up time was 19 months (Range: 1-60). The subcutaneous mastectomy was performed through an incision removing a portion of the skin overlying the tumour. An extemporaneous histological examination was performed on the retroareolar glandular tissue. If the histology was positive the patient was not considered eligible. Then an intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (ELIOT) of 16 Gy in one shot was delivered on the NAC area. An immediate breast reconstruction was done using implants in most cases and in several cases a musculocutaneous flaps, usually in large breast. The number of local recurrences was recorded and the correlation between their occurrence and the clinical and histological criteria were analysed using the Gray test statistical method in a competing framework. Results In 516 cases the negative retroareolar frozen section biopsy was confirmed by the final histology, while in 63 cases, the final histology showed foci of carcinoma. Seven out of these 63 cases underwent a secondary NAC removal. In the 56 cases which preserved areolas we did not observe any local recurrence after 19 months follow up. The probability of retro areola positive histology increases with the tumour size. and was not related to the nodal status. The rate of local relapses was 0.9% per year. We didn't find any significant difference in the local relapse rate according to different patient's and tumour's features. Most relapses were located close to the tumour bed but never in the NAC area. Conclusion Our study confirms that the local recurrence rate in the NSM completed with local radiotherapy on the NAC is not higher than the usual rate observed in the literature and the preservation of the NAC does not increase the risk. The absence of local recurrence in the region where a portion of glandular tissue has been purposely preserved is a good argument in favour of ELIOT. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,0

For intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in partial breast irradiation (PBI), this is especially relevant since the high dose is delivered in a single fraction. The purpose of this study was to compare the given dose to the expected dose PBI. Materials and Methods: During the period May 2010 - October 2014, 292 elderly (60+) patients, diagnosed with breast cancer (tumour diameter < 3 cm) were treated with IORT in our institution. For 47 of these patients, in vivo dosimetry was performed with MOSFETs (metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors, TN-502RD) or/and GAFCHROMIC EBT2 films. PBI with a total dose of 23.3 Gy at 100% (21 Gy at 90%) was given during the operation according to the method described in the ELIOT study (1). All patients were irradiated with electron beams generated with an IORT dedicated mobile accelerator (Mobetron, INTRAOP, USA). The in vivo dose measurements were done by attaching the first MOSFET detector under the bolus at the end of the applicator and the second detector attached behind the protection plate (6 mm aluminium plus 3 mm copper), which was used to shield the thorax. During the dose measurements with GAFROMIC films, the first and the second films were placed before and behind the protection plate, respectively. Calibration of the MOSFET detectors and the GAFCHROMIC films was done by measuring the absolute dose with a Roos type ionization chamber. The calibration measurements were performed with the electron beams of the Mobetron in a homemade PMMA phantom at the depth of dose maximum for each energy. Results: The results of in vivo MOSFET dosimetry for 27 patients and GAFCHROMIC film dosimetry for 20 patients are shown in panels (a) and (b), respectively. The measured with MOSFETs entry dose for the breast tissue agrees within 1.7% (SD 3.7%) with the expected dose. The dose measured with GAFCHROMIC films in breast tissue (before the protection plate) was within 3.7% of the prescribed dose. The dose measured with the both methods behind the protection plate was within 2 Gy. Conclusions: In vivo MOSFET and GAFROMIC film dosimetry during IORT was successful for PBI. The results of both methods are in a good agreement. The measured entry dose for the breast tissue agrees within 1.7% with the expected dose. For both methods, the dose to the thoracic wall and lungs was lower than 2 Gy even if 12 MeV was applied. (Table Presented).",,0

The calibration measurements were performed with the electron beams of the Mobetron in a homemade PMMA phantom at dose maximum for each energy. The usability of MOSFETs for IORT was studied before (2). Results: The results of in vivo dosimetry are shown in the table. For patient 10, the measured entry dose deviates by -9.1%, probably because of multiple relocations of the applicator. The used applicator diameter range between 4 cm and 6.5 cm.

We report a single institution's experience of SLNB between 2006 and 2010. METHODS: Prospective consecutive cohort study of 59 patients recruited between 2006 and 2010. All patients underwent SLNB with preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, intraoperative blue dye, and handheld gamma probe. Sentinel nodes were evaluated with step-serial sectioning and immunohistochemistry. Endpoints included: overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS). RESULTS: A total of 59 patients (36 male and 23 female) were operated on. Of these, 42 patients (71%) were pT1 and 17 patients (29%) were pT2. In two patients the sentinel node was not identified and proceeded to elective neck dissection. A total of 150 nodes were harvested from the remaining 57 patients of which 21 nodes were positive in 17 patients; three patients had positive contralateral nodes. The 2-year OS, DSS, LRFS, and RRFS for the SLNB negative patients were 97.5, 100, 95.8, and 95.8% and for the SLNB positive patients 68.2, 81.8, 83.9, and 100% respectively. Only OS and DSS approached statistical significance with P values of 0.07 and 0.06. CONCLUSIONS: SLNB is a safe and accurate diagnostic technique for staging the neck with a negative predictive value in our series of 97.5%. Furthermore, in our series three patients (5%) had positive contralateral neck drainage that would have been missed by conventional ipsilateral neck dissection.",eng,0

This study reports the results of the prospective trial of the impact of intraoperative Cs-131 on neurocognitive function and quality of life (QoL) in patients with resected brain metastases. Between 2010 and 2012, 24 patients with newly diagnosed metastasis to the brain were accrued on a prospective protocol and treated with Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds after surgical resection. Physicians administered the mini-mental status examination (MMSE) and functional assessment of cancer therapy-brain (FACT-Br) questionnaire to all patients before treatment and again every 2 months for the duration of 6 months with additional follow-up again at 12 months. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to analyze statistically significant changes in MMSE over time and paired t test was used to analyze changes in FACT-BR. There was a statistical improvement in overall FACT-BR score at 4 and 6 months of follow-up when compared to baseline (162 vs. 143, P = 0.004; 164 vs. 143, P = 0.005 respectively) with a non-significant trend toward improvement at 2 and 12 months (154 vs. 143, P = 0.067; 159 vs. 149, P = 0.4). MMSE score was statistically improved at 4 and up to 12 months compared to pre-treatment MMSE (30 vs. 29, P = 0.017; 30 vs. 29, P = 0.001 respectively). Patients with brain metastasis who received intra-operative permanent Cs-131 brachytherapy implants saw an improvement of their neurocognitive status and self-assessment of QoL. In addition to the excellent local control of metastasis, this approach may contribute to the improvements in cognitive function and QOL.

IORT with electrons delivers a single dose of radiation equivalent to the total dosage with external fractionated radiotherapy directly to the tumour bed using a mobile linear accelerator located in the operating room. Alternatively, a smaller dose can be delivered as boost before to external radiation therapy. This paper will review our early experience. Methods: From February to December 2010, 113 patients were selected for partial breast irradiation. Thirty were excluded after preoperative MRI or during the intervention due to the tumor size, an involved sentinel lymph node or a non appropriated histology. Eighty three patients (mean age 61, range 40-84) were evaluable; two of them had bilateral tumors. Sixty seven tumor beds were treated with 21 Gy prescribed at the 90% isodose as a complete radiation treatment. In all those cases, the tumor size was then smaller than 2 cm and the sentinel node was not involved. Eighteen patients received 9 Gy as a boost prescribed at the 90% isodose. The boost approach was chosen due to the involved sentinel lymph node, the size larger than 2 cm or a lobular histology. These patients received postoperative external radiation. Results: The operative time was slightly increased. No immediate surgical morbidity was noticed. Late local side effects include hematoma (1.2%), breast infection (1.2%), axillary infection (1.2%), erythema (1.2%) and scar dehiscence (1.2%). The cosmetic results were good or very good in 87.5%. Conclusion: This technique is not associated with any operative difficulties. We need to access long term results according to local relapse risk and cosmesis.",,0

The aim of this prospective phase II study is to evaluate the treatment of early-stage breast cancer (T1 N0) with intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT) in terms of local control, early complications, and cosmesis. Patients and Methods. From February 2010 to February 2012, 200 patients underwent partial IOERT of the breast. Inclusion criteria were unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma, age >40 years, histological tumour size <20 mm, and no lymph node involvement. A 21 Gy dose was prescribed over the 90% isodose line in the tumour bed. Median follow-up is 23.3 months (7-37). Results. Acute toxicity was not frequent (Grade 1: 4.5%, Grade 2: 1%). The cosmetic result was considered to be very good or good in 92.5%. One ipsi lateral out-quadrant recurrence at 18 months was observed. The crude and actuarial local recurrence rates after median follow-up were 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. Conclusion. The preoperative diagnostic work-up must be comprehensive and the selection process must be rigorous for this therapeutic approach reserved for small ductal unifocal cancers. After a 23.3-month median follow-up time, the clinical results of IOERT for selected patients are encouraging for the locoregional recurrence and the toxicity rates. The satisfaction of our patients in terms of quality of life was extremely high. © 2014 C. Philippson et al.",,1

Taylor,2008.0,Abdominal wall CT angiography: a detailed account of a newly established preoperative imaging technique,10.1148/radiol.2483072054,"Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study, and all patients gave written informed consent. Autologous surgical breast reconstruction with use of abdominal wall donor flaps based on the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) and one or more of its anterior musculocutaneous perforating branches (DIEA perforator flap) is being used with increasing frequency instead of breast reconstruction with use of traditional transverse rectus abdominus musculocutaneous and modified muscle-sparing flaps. Preoperative mapping of the DIEA perforators with abdominal wall computed tomographic (CT) angiography may improve patient care by providing the surgeon with additional information that will lead to optimization of the surgical technique, shorter procedure time, and reduction in the frequency of surgical complications. The branching patterns of the DIEA, the segmental anatomy of the anterior adipocutaneous perforating branches of the DIEA, and the importance of these features in pre- and intraoperative surgical planning necessitate a different approach to abdominal wall CT angiography than that used with other abdominal CT angiographic techniques. In abdominal wall CT angiography, the common femoral artery is used as the bolus trigger, CT scanning is performed in the caudocranial direction, the automatic exposure control feature is disabled, a scaled grid overlay tool is used to present information to the surgeons, and radiation dose is minimized (average dose, 6 mSv). The anatomic accuracy of abdominal wall CT angiography has been investigated in cadaveric and surgical studies, with sensitivity of 96%-100% and specificity of 95%-100%. This detailed description will allow other radiologists and surgeons interested in free DIEP flap surgery to incorporate this useful tool into their practice.",eng,0

Bryant,2015.0,The INTRABEAM(R) Photon Radiotherapy System for the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation,10.3310/hta19690,"BACKGROUND: Initial treatment for early breast cancer is usually either breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy. After BCS, whole-breast external beam radiotherapy (WB-EBRT) is the standard of care. A potential alternative to post-operative WB-EBRT is intraoperative radiation therapy delivered by the INTRABEAM((R)) Photon Radiotherapy System (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) to the tissue adjacent to the resection cavity at the time of surgery. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of INTRABEAM for the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer during surgical removal of the tumour. DATA SOURCES: Electronic bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library, were searched from inception to March 2014 for English-language articles. Bibliographies of articles, systematic reviews, clinical guidelines and the manufacturer's submission were also searched. The advisory group was contacted to identify additional evidence. METHODS: Systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness were conducted. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were applied to full texts of retrieved papers by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer, and differences in opinion were resolved through discussion at each stage. Clinical effectiveness studies were included if they were carried out in patients with early operable breast cancer. The intervention was the INTRABEAM system, which was compared with WB-EBRT, and study designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Controlled clinical trials could be considered if data from available RCTs were incomplete (e.g. absence of data on outcomes of interest). A cost-utility decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness of INTRABEAM compared with WB-EBRT for early operable breast cancer. RESULTS: One non-inferiority RCT, TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy Alone (TARGIT-A), met the inclusion criteria for the review. The review found that local recurrence was slightly higher following INTRABEAM than WB-EBRT, but the difference did not exceed the 2.5% non-inferiority margin providing INTRABEAM was given at the same time as BCS. Overall survival was similar with both treatments. Statistically significant differences in complications were found for the occurrence of wound seroma requiring more than three aspirations (more frequent in the INTRABEAM group) and for a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity score of grade 3 or 4 (less frequent in the INTRABEAM group). Cost-effectiveness base-case analysis indicates that INTRABEAM is less expensive but also less effective than WB-EBRT because it is associated with lower total costs but fewer total quality-adjusted life-years gained. However, sensitivity analyses identified four model parameters that can cause a switch in the treatment option that is considered cost-effective. LIMITATIONS: The base-case result from the model is subject to uncertainty because the disease progression parameters are largely drawn from the single available RCT. The RCT median follow-up of 2 years 5 months may be inadequate, particularly as the number of participants with local recurrence is low. The model is particularly sensitive to this parameter. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A significant investment in INTRABEAM equipment and staff training (clinical and non-clinical) would be required to make this technology available across the NHS. Longer-term follow-up data from the TARGIT-A trial and analysis of registry data are required as results are currently based on a small number of events and economic modelling results are uncertain.

Differences in cosmetic outcome were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cosmetic results in 47 patients having a per-operative implant were compared to 123 patients having a delayed interstitial implant in a matched case-control study. Cosmesis was scored on a four-point-scale varying from 0 (excellent) to 3 (poor). RESULTS: After mean follow-up of 63 months, three observers found no difference in cosmetic outcome between the two groups after adjustment for variables found to be related with cosmesis (difference in mean score 0.50, P=0.26). Implant volume at 100% isodose was not found to differ (P=0.084) between the per-operative group (mean 102 cm3, S.D. 34 cm3) and the delayed group (mean 93 cm3, S.D. 29 cm3). CONCLUSIONS: Performing per-operative implants has not led to smaller implants. The method of performing brachytherapy does not result in marked differences in cosmetic outcome.",eng,0

We report the 5-year efficacy and tolerance for a cohort, pooling patients from 3 clinical trials. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The trials accrued postmenopausal patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ </=3 cm and clear surgical margins, who were node negative, and had a planning target volume <120 cm(3). The outcomes included overall and disease-free survival and local and contralateral recurrence at 5 years. The true local recurrence rate was compared using 2-tailed paired t tests for estimates calculated using the Tufts University ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and Memorial Sloan Kettering ductal carcinoma in situ nomograms. RESULTS: The cohort included 134 patients, and the observed local recurrence rate at a median follow-up period of 63 months was 1.2% +/- 1.2%, similar to the estimate for whole breast irradiation (P=.23), significantly better than for surgery alone (relative risk 0.27; P<.001), and significantly lower than contralateral recurrence (relative risk 0.33; P<.001). The 5-year overall survival rate was 97.4% +/- 1.9%, and the disease-free survival rate was 96.4% +/- 2.1%. At 2 months, 42% of the patients had erythema, 20% induration, and 16% moist desquamation. The rate of mainly grade 1 telangiectasia was 22.4% at 2 years and 24% at 5 years. The rate of asymptomatic induration was 23% at 2 years and 40% at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year data suggest that permanent breast seed implantation is a safe accelerated partial breast irradiation option after lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer with a tolerance profile similar to that of whole breast irradiation.",eng,0

Ravi,2011.0,Doses to internal organs for various breast radiation techniques--implications on the risk of secondary cancers and cardiomyopathy,10.1186/1748-717x-6-5,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancers are more frequently diagnosed at an early stage and currently have improved long term outcomes. Late normal tissue complications induced by adjuvant radiotherapy like secondary cancers or cardiomyopathy must now be avoided at all cost. Several new breast radiotherapy techniques have been developed and this work aims at comparing the scatter doses of internal organs for those techniques. METHODS: A CT-scan of a typical early stage left breast cancer patient was used to describe a realistic anthropomorphic phantom in the MCNP Monte Carlo code. Dose tally detectors were placed in breasts, the heart, the ipsilateral lung, and the spleen. Five irradiation techniques were simulated: whole breast radiotherapy 50 Gy in 25 fractions using physical wedge or breast IMRT, 3D-CRT partial breast radiotherapy 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions, HDR brachytherapy delivering 34 Gy in 10 treatments, or Permanent Breast 103Pd Seed Implant delivering 90 Gy. RESULTS: For external beam radiotherapy the wedge compensation technique yielded the largest doses to internal organs like the spleen or the heart, respectively 2,300 mSv and 2.7 Gy. Smaller scatter dose are induced using breast IMRT, respectively 810 mSv and 1.1 Gy, or 3D-CRT partial breast irradiation, respectively 130 mSv and 0.7 Gy. Dose to the lung is also smaller for IMRT and 3D-CRT compared to the wedge technique. For multicatheter HDR brachytherapy a large dose is delivered to the heart, 3.6 Gy, the spleen receives 1,171 mSv and the lung receives 2,471 mSv. These values are 44% higher in case of a balloon catheter. In contrast, breast seeds implant is associated with low dose to most internal organs. CONCLUSIONS: The present data support the use of breast IMRT or virtual wedge technique instead of physical wedges for whole breast radiotherapy. Regarding partial breast irradiation techniques, low energy source brachytherapy and external beam 3D-CRT appear safer than 192Ir HDR techniques.",eng,0

The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate mammographic changes in breast tissue within the first 3 years after breast conserving surgery and whole breast irradiation with an additional IOERT- versus percutaneous boost. Materials: A total of 53 breast cancer patients (stage I/II) treated between 2006 and 2008 were included. All patients were treated with breast conserving surgery followed by a fractionated whole breast radiotherapy with a total dose of 50.4 Gy. Twenty patients had a 10 Gy intraoperative electron boost (IOB), performed with the mobile Linac NOVAC 7. These patients were matched-pair compared with 33 patients treated with a fractionated, percutaneous electron boost (FPB) with median 10 Gy according to age, tumor stage, tumor localization or adjuvant systemic treatment. The follow-up mammograms, performed every 6-12 months, were focused on fat necroses, parenchymal scarring and skin thickening. Mammographic changes were diagnosed by a radiologist in a blinded setting. The fisher exact test was used to detect significant differences. Results: Fat necroses occurred significantly more frequent in IOB-patients compared to FPB-patients (50 vs. 18.2 %, p=0.02) (fig 1). The fat necroses were mammographically detected median 17 vs. 23 months post surgery for the IOB vs FPB patients. The median size of fat necroses was 24 (14-30) mm for the IOB-group and 14 (4-53) mm for the FPB-group. The parenchymal scarring grade 3-4 was significantly more frequent seen in the IORT-boost patient mammograms (63.2 vs. 21.9 %, p=0.006) (fig 1). The skin-thickening differed not significantly in the two cohorts (p=0.1) (fig 1). In seven patients (IOB: 5, FPB: 2) the mammographically diagnosis was verified histologically because of diagnostic uncertainties (Figure presented) Conclusions: According to the literature an IORT-boost lead to significantly more fat necroses and parenchymal scarrings in our analysis. The knowledge of this phenomenon is clinically relevant because it can mimick in-breast recurrences. The radiotherapy technique must be included in the diagnostic process of differentiation between posttherapeutic changes and recurrence. In uncertain cases the MR-mammogramm seems to be helpful but if the clarifying is not completely possible, the biopsy is mandatory.",,0

Materials and Methods: A total of 54 patients with breast cancer were treated with IORT boost as part of a breast conserving therapy from 1/20062/2009, using the dedicated mobile linear accelerator NOVAC7. Mean follow-up time was 25 (range: 656) months. The indications for IORT boost were age 50 years and/or tumor size 2 cm in preoperative imaging. After tumor resection the tissue was mobilized and approximated. The irradiation tube was placed into the situs under direct visual control. The boost dose was 10 Gy. Percutaneous whole breast irradiation was performed subsequently to the IORT boost. Results: One local relapse was seen to date. Freedom from local relapse and overall survival rates are 98.2 and 96.3%, respectively. No patient suffered grade III/IV toxicity. Mild erythema, hyperpigmentation, telangiectasia or fibrosis occurred in 70.4, 7.4, 5.6 and 25.9% of patients. The cosmetic result was assessed as very good or good by 90.7% of patients and 94.4% of physicians. Overall, 96.9% of the patients would undergo boost IORT again, if necessary. Conclusion: Boost IORT is associated with a low rate of telangiectasia, hyperpigmentation and subcutaneous fibrosis. The risk of a geographical miss due to postoperative tissue changes, oncoplastic shifts or migration of clip markers is excluded. The results of our analysis are comparable to those reported in the literature and show a high local efficiency, low toxicity and high patient acceptance of IORT boost. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",,0

Therefore, new imaging techniques are needed that support the surgeon with real-time feedback on tumour location and margin status. In this study, the potential of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging in BCS for pre- and intraoperative tumour localization, margin status assessment and detection of residual disease was assessed in tissue-simulating breast phantoms. METHODS: Breast-shaped phantoms were produced with optical properties that closely match those of normal breast tissue. Fluorescent tumour-like inclusions containing indocyanine green (ICG) were positioned at predefined locations in the phantoms to allow for simulation of (i) preoperative tumour localization, (ii) real-time NIRF-guided tumour resection, and (iii) intraoperative margin assessment. Optical imaging was performed using a custom-made clinical prototype NIRF intraoperative camera. RESULTS: Tumour-like inclusions in breast phantoms could be detected up to a depth of 21 mm using a NIRF intraoperative camera system. Real-time NIRF-guided resection of tumour-like inclusions proved feasible. Moreover, intraoperative NIRF imaging reliably detected residual disease in case of inadequate resection. CONCLUSION: We evaluated the potential of NIRF imaging applications for BCS. The clinical setting was simulated by exploiting tissue-like breast phantoms with fluorescent tumour-like agarose inclusions. From this evaluation, we conclude that intraoperative NIRF imaging is feasible and may improve BCS by providing the surgeon with imaging information on tumour location, margin status, and presence of residual disease in real-time. Clinical studies are needed to further validate these results.",eng,0

However, IORT is not yet accepted as standard of care and is not allowed in many clinical trial protocols. Herein, we report our early institutional experiences with IORT using the Intrabeam. Materials and Methods: From April 2012 through April 2014, we planned to treat 68 early stage breast cancer patients with IORT and treated 64 patients. Eligibility for IORT included post-menopausal women over the age of 50, an estimated tumor size of less than or equal to 3.5cm, no more than focal lymphovascular invasion, positive ER status (positive PR status was added later) and tumor pathology consistent with either invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). IORT was delivered concurrently with partial mastectomy, and all patients received 20 Gy prescribed to the applicator surface. Depending on surgeon preference, sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) was performed before or after the delivery of IORT for patients with invasive cancers. Sizers were designed and manufactured to sound the cavity and determine the correct applicator size for delivery of IORT. Criteria for whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) after IORT included positive or close margins, lymphovascular invasion or invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) found on final pathology, involvement of axillary lymph nodes and tumors with an extensive intraductal component. Results: IORTwas offered to 68 patients. IORTwas aborted in four patients due to the inability to maintain a 1cm margin to the skin, for a 94% IORT delivery completion rate. The median age of patients receiving IORT was 65 (range 51-87) and tumor size ranged from 0.3 to 2.2cm (mean 1cm). Final pathology revealed pure DCIS in 11 patients, ILC in two patients and IDC in 55 patients. A DCIS component was found in 26 patients with invasive tumor. Eight patients (11.7%) had either positive (5) or close (3, <1mm) margins. Re-excision was performed in four patients with no residual tumor, one patient refused, and was not recommended for three patients. WBRT was recommended for nine patients (14%). Reasons for WBRT included positive lymph node status (3), positive lymph node status and ILC (1), close margin and ILC (1), extensive DCIS component and positive/close margin (2), negative PR status (1) and close margin (1). Four patients (6.3%) had acute side effects requiring intervention: two patients developed seroma requiring drainage more than three times; one patient developed hematoma with subsequent abscess, and one patient had delayed wound healing with incision dehiscence. No patients had acute skin reactions. The timing of SLND did not affect the development of acute side effects. In the follow-up period (1 to 25 months), one patient had recurrent/persistent DCIS at one year requiring re-excision and WBRT and two patients died of unrelated reasons. Conclusions: Partial breast IORT is well tolerated in our patient population with a low complication rate. Careful patient selection still resulted in 14% of patients needing to undergo WBRT. Given our recent adoption of IORT, long-term follow-up is required to further address outcomes. (Figure Presented).",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1998 and 2004, 258 selected patients with T1 N0-1mi, Grade 1-2, nonlobular breast cancer without presence of extensive intraductal component and resected with negative margins were randomized after breast-conserving surgery to receive 50 Gy/25 fractions WBI (n = 130) or PBI (n = 128). The latter consisted of either 7 x 5.2 Gy high-dose-rate (HDR) multicatheter brachytherapy (BT; n = 88) or 50 Gy/25 fractions electron beam (EB) irradiation (n = 40). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 66 months, the 5-year actuarial rate of local recurrence was 4.7% and 3.4% in the PBI and WBI arms, respectively (p = 0.50). There was no significant difference in the 5-year probability of overall survival (94.6% vs. 91.8%), cancer-specific survival (98.3% vs. 96.0%), and disease-free survival (88.3% vs. 90.3%). The rate of excellent to good cosmetic result was 77.6% in the PBI group (81.2% after HDR BT; 70.0% after EB) and 62.9% in the control group (52.2% after telecobalt; 65.6% after 6-9-MV photons; p(WBI/PBI) = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Partial breast irradiation using interstitial HDR implants or EB to deliver radiation to the tumor bed alone for a selected group of early-stage breast cancer patients produces 5-year results similar to those achieved with conventional WBI.

Nemeth,2001.0,The role of boost irradiation in the conservative treatment of stage I-II breast cancer,", ","In this article, we review the current status, indication, technical aspects, controversies, and future prospects of boost irradiation after breast conserving surgery (BCS). BCS and radiotherapy (RT) of the conserved breast became widely accepted in the last decades for the treatment of early invasive breast cancer. The standard technique of RT after breast conservation is to treat the whole breast up to a total dose of 45 to 50 Gy. However, there is no consensus among radiation oncologists about the necessity of boost dose to the tumor bed. Generally accepted criteria for identification of high risk subgroups, in which boost is recommended, have not been established yet. Further controversy exists regarding the optimal boost technique (electron vs. brachytherapy), and their impact on local tumor control and cosmesis. Based on the results of numerous retrospective and recently published prospective trials, the European brachytherapy society (GEC-ESTRO), as well as the American Brachytherapy Society has issued their guidelines in these topics. These guidelines will help clinicians in their medical decisions. Some aspects of boost irradiation still remain somewhat controversial. The final results of prospective boost trials with longer follow-up, involving analyses based on pathologically defined subgroups, will clarify these controversies. Preliminary results with recently developed boost techniques (intraoperative RT, CT-image based 3D conformal brachytherapy, and 3D virtual brachytherapy) are promising. However, more experience and longer follow-up are required to define whether these methods might improve local tumor control for breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery and RT.",eng,0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 2004, 258 selected women with pT1 pN0-1mi M0, grade 1-2, non-lobular breast cancer without the presence of extensive intraductal component and resected with negative margins were randomized after BCS to receive 50 Gy WBI (n=130) or PBI (n=128). The latter consisted of either 7 x 5.2 Gy high-dose-rate (HDR) multi-catheter brachytherapy (BT; n=88) or 50 Gy electron beam (EB) irradiation (n=40). Primary endpoint was local recurrence (LR) as a first event. Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), disease-free survival (DFS), and cosmetic results. RESULTS: After a median follow up of 10.2 years, the ten-year actuarial rate of LR was 5.9% and 5.1% in PBI and WBI arms, respectively (p=0.77). There was no significant difference in the ten-year probability of OS (80% vs 82%), CSS (94% vs 92%), and DFS (85% vs 84%), either. The rate of excellent-good cosmetic result was 81% in the PBI, and 63% in the control group (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Partial breast irradiation delivered by interstitial HDR BT or EB for a selected group of early-stage breast cancer patients produces similar ten-year results to those achieved with conventional WBI.

First results of the randomized boost trial of the National Institute of Oncology],Huon.2001.45.5.0385,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of tumour bed boost on local tumour control (LTC) after breast conserving surgery in a prospective study. METHODS: Between 1995 and 1998, 207 women with early invasive breast cancer who underwent conservative operation were treated by 50 Gy irradiation to the whole breast and then randomly assigned to receive either no further radiotherapy (n=103) or a boost to the tumour bed (n=104) with either 16 Gy electron (n=52) or 12-14.25 Gy high dose rate brachytherapy (n=52). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 4.25 years the crude rate of local recurrence was 6.7% with and 13.6% without boost. The respective rates of tumour bed relapse were 3.8% vs. 10.7%. The 4 year probability of LTC, relapse-free survival and breast cancer-specific survival was 94.2% vs. 85.1% (p=0.1176), 82.3% vs. 67.2% (p=0.0438) and 84.8% vs. 90.9% (p=0.1111), respectively, in favour of the boost group.

Boost treatments consisted of either 16 Gy electron irradiation (n = 52) or 12-14,25 Gy HDR BT (n = 52). Breast cancer-related events, side effects, and cosmetic results were assessed. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 5.3 years, the crude rate of local recurrences was 6.7% (7/104) with and 15.5% (16/103) without boost. The 5-year probability of LTC, relapse-free survival (RFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 92.7% vs. 84.9% (p = 0.049), 76.6% vs. 66.2% (p = 0.044), and 90.4% vs. 82.1% (p = 0.053), respectively.

On multivariate analysis, patient age < 40 years (RR: 4.53), positive margin status (RR: 4.17), and high mitotic activity index (RR: 3.60) were found to be significant risk factors for local recurrence. The incidence of grade 2-3 side effects was higher in the boost arm (17.3% vs. 7.8%; p = 0.03).

CONCLUSIONS: Boost dose significantly improves LTC and RFS in patients treated with BCS and radiotherapy. In spite of the higher incidence of late side effects in the boost arm, boost dose is strongly recommended for patients at high risk for local recurrence. Positive or close margin status, high mitotic activity index, and young patient age should be viewed as absolute indications for tumor bed boost.

The postirradiation side effects were examined by MRI, mammogram, US and physical examination, as well. MRI was performed on a 0.5 T, double breast coil, with SE-T1, SE-T2 and 3D-GE sequences. The findings of MRI and mammography were compared to physically detectable side effects using the RTOG/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring scheme. US is useful in the measurement of skin thickening and in the diagnosis of fat necrosis. Mammography and physical examination are very subjective and low specificity methods to evaluate postirradiation side effects. MRI is a suitable and more objective method to detect the real extent and quantity of skin thickening and fibrosis. The incidence of > or = G2 side effects of skin and breast parenchyma were 64.5 and 32.2%, respectively. The differences between the side effects of whole breast irradiation and sole brachytherapy of the tumour bed are also clearly demonstrated. Brachytherapy alone is feasible without compromising cosmetic results.

METHODS: Forty-five prospectively selected patients with T1 breast cancer undergoing BCS were enrolled into a phase I-II study of TBRT alone, using interstitial HDR implants. HDR-BT of 7 x 4.33 Gy (n = 8) and 7 x 5.2 Gy (n = 37) was delivered to the tumor bed. Based on the results of this phase I-II study, a further 126 patients were randomized to receive 50 Gy WBRT (n = 63) or TBRT alone (n = 63); the latter consisted of either 7 x 5.2 Gy HDR-BT (n = 46) or 50-Gy wide-field electron irradiation (n = 17). Breast cancer related events and side effects were assessed. RESULTS: In the phase I-II study, at a median follow-up of 57 months, 2 (4.4%) local, 3 (6.7%) axillary, and 3 (6.7%) distant failures were observed. Two patients (4.4%) died of breast cancer. The 5-year probability of cancer-specific, relapse-free and local recurrence-free survival was 90.0%, 85.9%, and 95.6%, respectively. The cosmetic results were judged to be excellent in 44 of 45 patients (97.8%). Severe (higher than grade 2) skin sequelae or fibrosis was not found. Symptomatic fat necrosis occurred in one patient (2.2%). In the phase III study, at a median follow-up of 30 months, the locoregional tumor control was 100% in both arms. The 3-year probability of cancer-specific and relapse-free survival was 98.1% and 98.4% in the WBRT group and 100% and 94.4% in the TBRT group, respectively (P = NS). There was no significant difference between the two treatment arms regarding the incidence of radiation side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Five-year results of our phase I-II study prove that sole HDR-BT of the tumor bed with careful patient selection and adequate quality assurance is a feasible alternative to WBRT.

In spite of adequate surgery and radiotherapy, the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence is approximately 10%. In such cases salvage mastectomy is the standard treatment, however wide reexcision of the recurrent tumor is also a reasonable option for selected patients. The risk of second local relapse is higher following further breast conservation compared to mastectomy. The authors report the technique of tumor reexcision combined with intraoperative implantation and perioperative high dose rate (HDR) bracytherapy of the tumor bed for the salvage of recurrence in a previously irradiated breast. One can perform two operative interventions at the same time with this method. Irradiation can be started safely within 48 hours after surgery. A review of the literature is also performed by the authors to demonstrate the role and indication of perioperative brachytherapy in the treatment of breast tumor relapse and other cancer recurrences. Reexcision is a practicable alternative to mastectomy for solitary, parenchymal breast tumor relapse measured 2 cm or less in diameter. Perioperative brachytherapy may decrease the risk of second relapse without increasing radiation side effects. Further prospective study is required to define the value of the prescribed method in comparison with salvage mastectomy.",hun,0

The aim of this study was to compare the usefulness of NIR guided ICG and ICG:HSA against the gamma emitting radiocolloid (RC). METHODS: A group of 49 consecutive breast cancer patients underwent SLNB using RC. From this group, the first 28 patients were compared against ICG, while the next 21 patients were compared against ICG:HSA. The number of patients with visible fluorescent path was recorded. Furthermore, the number of SLNs detected by fluorophores percutaneously and total number of intraoperative SLNs detected by fluorophores and/or RC was noted. RESULTS: NIR guided real time lymphatic flow was observed in 47/49 patients (96%). In all cases except one, SLNs detected by the RC tracer were also detected by their respective fluorophore. Additionally, ICG detected 10 additional SLNs in 8 patients, while 3 additional SLNs were detected by ICG:HSA in 3 patients. Statistical analysis revealed no difference between the number of SLNs detected between ICG versus ICG:HSA and RC versus ICG:HSA. However, a significant statistical difference was observed between RC and ICG (p=0.0117), as well as between the combined NIR guided and RC method (p=0.0033). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the use of either ICG or ICG:HSA with RC to obtain SLNB seems to be an effective alternative. Compared to RC alone, the use of ICG:HSA, more so than ICG alone, may provide additional benefits.",eng,0

Factors influencing the decision-making process in breast reconstruction are analyzed. New trends of immediate breast reconstruction are presented. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: New indications for postmastectomy radiation have caused a dramatic increase in the number of radiated patients presenting for breast reconstruction. The major studies and their impact on breast cancer management practice are analyzed. Unsatisfactory results of conventional immediate reconstruction techniques followed by radiotherapy led to a new treatment algorithm for these patients. If the need for postoperative radiation therapy is known, a delayed reconstruction should be considered. When an immediate reconstruction is still desired despite the certainty of postoperative radiotherapy, reconstructive options should be based on tissue characteristics and blood supply. Autologous tissue reconstruction options should be given a priority in an order reflecting superiority of vascularity and resistance to radiation: latissimus dorsi flap, free TRAM or pedicled TRAM without any contralateral components of tissue, pedicled TRAM/midabdominal TRAM, and perforator flap. CONCLUSIONS: When the indications for postoperative radiotherapy are unknown, premastectomy sentinel node biopsy, delayed-immediate reconstruction, or delayed reconstruction is preferable.

Journal Article,E. Poon; F. Verhaegen,2009.0,A CT-based analytical dose calculation method for HDR 192Ir brachytherapy,10.1118/1.3184695,"PURPOSE: This article presents an analytical dose calculation method for high-dose-rate 192Ir brachytherapy, taking into account the effects of inhomogeneities and reduced photon backscatter near the skin. The adequacy of the Task Group 43 (TG-43) two-dimensional formalism for treatment planning is also assessed. METHODS: The proposed method uses material composition and density data derived from computed tomography images. The primary and scatter dose distributions for each dwell position are calculated first as if the patient is an infinite water phantom. This is done using either TG-43 or a database of Monte Carlo (MC) dose distributions. The latter can be used to account for the effects of shielding in water. Subsequently, corrections for photon attenuation, scatter, and spectral variations along medium- or low-Z inhomogeneities are made according to the radiological paths determined by ray tracing. The scatter dose is then scaled by a correction factor that depends on the distances between the point of interest, the body contour, and the source position. Dose calculations are done for phantoms with tissue and lead inserts, as well as patient plans for head-and-neck, esophagus, and MammoSite balloon breast brachytherapy treatments. Gamma indices are evaluated using a dose-difference criterion of 3% and a distance-to-agreement criterion of 2 mm. PTRAN_CT MC calculations are used as the reference dose distributions. RESULTS: For the phantom with tissue and lead inserts, the percentages of the voxels of interest passing the gamma criteria (Pgamma > or = 1) are 100% for the analytical calculation and 91% for TG-43. For the breast patient plan, TG-43 overestimates the target volume receiving the prescribed dose by 4% and the dose to the hottest 0.1 cm3 of the skin by 9%, whereas the analytical and MC results agree within 0.4%. Pgamma > or = 1 are 100% and 48% for the analytical and TG-43 calculations, respectively. For the head-and-neck and esophagus patient plans, Pgamma > or = 1 are > or = 99% for both calculation methods. CONCLUSIONS: A correction-based dose calculation method has been validated for HDR 192Ir brachytherapy. Its high calculation efficiency makes it feasible for use in treatment planning. Because tissue inhomogeneity effects are small and primary dose predominates in the near-source region, TG-43 is adequate for target dose estimation provided shielding and contrast solution are not used.",eng,0

This paper investigates the potential impact of the different boost techniques on local control and on fibrosis after breast conserving therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1989 to 1996, 2661 patients were randomised to receive a boost dose of 16Gy to the primary tumour bed after microscopically complete tumorectomy and 50Gy whole breast irradiation. The choice of the boost technique was left to the treating investigator. Treatment data were prospectively recorded as well as the clinical outcome in terms of local control and fibrosis. Sixty-three percent of the patients received a boost dose with fast electrons, 28% with photon beams and 9% with interstitial brachytherapy. RESULTS: At 5 years, local recurrences were seen in 74 of the 1635 patients who received an electron boost (4.8%, CI 3.6-5.9%), in 28 of the 753 patients who received a photon boost (4.0%, CI 3.4-5.5%) and in 6 of the 225 patients after an interstitial boost (2.5%, CI 0.3-4.6%). The grade of fibrosis in the whole breast as well as at the primary tumour bed, as scored by the treating radiation oncologist, was similar in the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although the three groups are of a rather unequal size, the results of the interstitial boost seem similar in terms of fibrosis and at least as good in terms of local control, despite a lower treatment volume and a longer overall treatment time.",eng,0

Here, we provide an overview on the exploitation of synthetic lethality to overcome drug resistance to conventional chemotherapy in several types of solid tumors. We report recent findings on cellular markers and gene mutations which are specifically essential for the viability of cancer cells and for resistance to chemotherapeutics. In addition, new molecularly targeted strategies to overcome drug resistance are suggested. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",,0

Beaulieu,2013.0,Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy,10.1118/1.4826335,"PURPOSE: An innovative, simple, and fast method to optimize the number and position of catheters is presented for prostate and breast high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, both for arbitrary templates or template-free implants (such as robotic templates). METHODS: Eight clinical cases were chosen randomly from a bank of patients, previously treated in our clinic to test our method. The 2D Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVT) algorithm was adapted to distribute catheters uniformly in space, within the maximum external contour of the planning target volume. The catheters optimization procedure includes the inverse planning simulated annealing algorithm (IPSA). Complete treatment plans can then be generated from the algorithm for different number of catheters. The best plan is chosen from different dosimetry criteria and will automatically provide the number of catheters and their positions. After the CVT algorithm parameters were optimized for speed and dosimetric results, it was validated against prostate clinical cases, using clinically relevant dose parameters. The robustness to implantation error was also evaluated. Finally, the efficiency of the method was tested in breast interstitial HDR brachytherapy cases. RESULTS: The effect of the number and locations of the catheters on prostate cancer patients was studied. Treatment plans with a better or equivalent dose distributions could be obtained with fewer catheters. A better or equal prostate V100 was obtained down to 12 catheters. Plans with nine or less catheters would not be clinically acceptable in terms of prostate V100 and D90. Implantation errors up to 3 mm were acceptable since no statistical difference was found when compared to 0 mm error (p > 0.05). No significant difference in dosimetric indices was observed for the different combination of parameters within the CVT algorithm. A linear relation was found between the number of random points and the optimization time of the CVT algorithm. Because the computation time decrease with the number of points and that no effects were observed on the dosimetric indices when varying the number of sampling points and the number of iterations, they were respectively fixed to 2500 and to 100. The computation time to obtain ten complete treatments plans ranging from 9 to 18 catheters, with the corresponding dosimetric indices, was 90 s. However, 93% of the computation time is used by a research version of IPSA. For the breast, on average, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recommendations would be satisfied down to 12 catheters. Plans with nine or less catheters would not be clinically acceptable in terms of V100, dose homogeneity index, and D90. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have devised a simple, fast and efficient method to optimize the number and position of catheters in interstitial HDR brachytherapy. The method was shown to be robust for both prostate and breast HDR brachytherapy. More importantly, the computation time of the algorithm is acceptable for clinical use. Ultimately, this catheter optimization algorithm could be coupled with a 3D ultrasound system to allow real-time guidance and planning in HDR brachytherapy.",eng,0

Beaulieu,2015.0,Validation of a novel robot-assisted 3DUS system for real-time planning and guidance of breast interstitial HDR brachytherapy,10.1118/1.4934832,"PURPOSE: In current clinical practice, there is no integrated 3D ultrasound (3DUS) guidance system clinically available for breast brachytherapy. In this study, the authors present a novel robot-assisted 3DUS system for real-time planning and guidance of breast interstitial high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment. METHODS: For this work, a new computer controlled robotic 3DUS system was built to perform a hybrid motion scan, which is a combination of a 6 cm linear translation with a 30 degrees rotation at both ends. The new 3DUS scanner was designed to fit on a modified Kuske assembly, keeping the current template grid configuration but modifying the frame to allow the mounting of the 3DUS system at several positions. A finer grid was also tested. A user interface was developed to perform image reconstruction, semiautomatic segmentation of the surgical bed as well as catheter reconstruction and tracking. A 3D string phantom was used to validate the geometric accuracy of the reconstruction. The volumetric accuracy of the system was validated with phantoms using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) images. In order to accurately determine whether 3DUS can effectively replace CT for treatment planning, the authors have compared the 3DUS catheter reconstruction to the one obtained from CT images. In addition, in agarose-based phantoms, an end-to-end procedure was performed by executing six independent complete procedures with both 14 and 16 catheters, and for both standard and finer Kuske grids. Finally, in phantoms, five end-to-end procedures were performed with the final CT planning for the validation of 3DUS preplanning. RESULTS: The 3DUS acquisition time is approximately 10 s. A paired Student t-test showed that there was no statistical significant difference between known and measured values of string separations in each direction. Both MRI and CT volume measurements were not statistically different from 3DUS volume (Student t-test: p > 0.05) and they were significantly correlated to 3DUS measurement (Pearson test: MRI p < 0.05 and CT p < 0.001). The mean angular separation distance between catheter trajectories segmented from 3DUS and CT images was 0.42 degrees +/- 0.24 degrees , while the maximum and mean trajectory separations were 0.51 +/- 0.19 and 0.37 +/- 0.17 mm, respectively. Overall, the new finer grid has performed significantly better in terms of dosimetric indices. The planning target volume dosimetric indices were not found statistically different between 3DUS and CT planning (Student t-test, p > 0.05). Both the skin and the pectoral muscle dosimetric indices were within ABS guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: A novel robot-assisted 3DUS system was designed and validated. To their knowledge, this is the first system capable of performing real-time guidance and planning of breast multicatheter HDR brachytherapy treatments. Future investigation will test the feasibility of using the system in the clinic and for permanent breast brachytherapy.",eng,0

Ten Haken,2015.0,Comparison of three magnetic nanoparticle tracers for sentinel lymph node biopsy in an in vivo porcine model,10.2147/ijn.s76962,"INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer staging with sentinel lymph node biopsy relies on the use of radioisotopes, which limits the availability of the procedure worldwide. The use of a magnetic nanoparticle tracer and a handheld magnetometer provides a radiation-free alternative, which was recently evaluated in two clinical trials. The hydrodynamic particle size of the used magnetic tracer differs substantially from the radioisotope tracer and could therefore benefit from optimization. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of three different-sized magnetic nanoparticle tracers for sentinel lymph node biopsy within an in vivo porcine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed within a validated porcine model using three magnetic nanoparticle tracers, approved for use in humans (ferumoxytol, with hydrodynamic diameter d H =32 nm; Sienna+((R)), d H =59 nm; and ferumoxide, d H =111 nm), and a handheld magnetometer. Magnetometer counts (transcutaneous and ex vivo), iron quantification (vibrating sample magnetometry), and histopathological assessments were performed on all ex vivo nodes. RESULTS: Transcutaneous hotspots"" were present in 12/12 cases within 30 minutes of injection for the 59 nm tracer, compared to 7/12 for the 32 nm tracer and 8/12 for the 111 nm tracer, at the same time point. Ex vivo magnetometer counts were significantly greater for the 59 nm tracer than for the other tracers. Significantly more nodes per basin were excised for the 32 nm tracer compared to other tracers, indicating poor retention of the 32 nm tracer. Using the 59 nm tracer resulted in a significantly higher iron accumulation compared to the 32 nm tracer. CONCLUSION: The 59 nm tracer demonstrated rapid lymphatic uptake, retention in the first nodes reached, and accumulation in high concentration, making it the most suitable tracer for intraoperative sentinel lymph node localization.""",eng,0

The use of gamma detection probe technology in radioguided surgery has tremendously expanded and has evolved into what is now considered an established discipline within the practice of surgery, revolutionizing the surgical management of many malignancies, including breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer, as well as the surgical management of parathyroid disease. The impact of radioguided surgery on the surgical management of cancer patients includes providing vital and real-time information to the surgeon regarding the location and extent of disease, as well as regarding the assessment of surgical resection margins. Additionally, it has allowed the surgeon to minimize the surgical invasiveness of many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, while still maintaining maximum benefit to the cancer patient. In the current review, we have attempted to comprehensively evaluate the history, technical aspects, and clinical applications of radioguided surgery using gamma detection probe technology.",eng,0

Although this technique is logically appealing - providing more directed radiation to sites at high risk of local failure - there remains little empirical support that this intervention is non-inferior to external beam radiotherapy, a well-established standard. Additionally, observational studies suggest that balloon brachytherapy is associated with high rates of local complications, and higher rates of subsequent mastectomy, a marker of local failure. Here, I explore regulatory and clinical considerations that lead to the widespread adoption of breast brachytherapy. I argue that the therapy spread before its efficacy was confirmed.

Journal Article,S. M. Presciutti; T. Karukanda; M. Lee,2014.0,Management decisions for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis significantly affect patient radiation exposure,10.1016/j.spinee.2013.11.055,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients treated before the 1990s have a 1% to 2% increased lifetime risk of developing breast and thyroid cancer as a result of ionizing radiation from plain radiographs. Although present plain radiographic techniques have been able to reduce some of the radiation exposure, modern treatment algorithms for scoliosis often include computed tomography (CT) and intraoperative fluoroscopy. The exact magnitude of exposure to ionizing radiation in adolescents during modern scoliosis treatment is therefore unclear. PURPOSE: To determine the difference in radiation exposures in patients undergoing various forms of treatment for AIS. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients aged 9 to 18 years with a diagnosis of AIS, followed and/or treated with nonoperative or operative management for a minimum of 2 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of radiographs and total radiation exposure calculated. METHODS: The charts and radiographs of patients managed for AIS at a single institution between September 2007 and January 2012 were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups: operative group, braced group, and observation group. Patient demographics, Cobb angles, and curve types were recorded. The number of radiographs per year that each patient received and the total radiation dose were recorded. The plain radiographic radiation exposure was then combined with the direct exposure recording from ancillary tests, such as fluoroscopy and CT, and a radiation exposure rate was calculated (mrad/y). A single-factor analysis of variance (alpha=0.01) with a Tukey honest significant difference post hoc analysis was used to test significance between groups. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-seven patients were evaluated: 86 operative, 80 brace, and 101 observation. All groups had similar demographics and curve type distribution. The mean initial Cobb angle at presentation was significantly different between the groups: operative (57 degrees +/-11 degrees ), brace (24 degrees +/-7.9 degrees ), and observation (18 degrees +/-9.4 degrees ) (p<.01). There was a significant difference among the groups in terms of the mean number of radiographs received per year; operative group, 12.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.8-13.5; p<.001); braced group, 5.7 (95% CI: 5.2-6.2; p<.001), and observed group, 3.5 (95% CI: 3.160-3.864; p<.001). The operative group received 1,400 mrad per year (95% CI: 1,350-1,844; p<.001), braced group received 700 mrad per year (95% CI: 598-716; p<.001), and observed group received 400 mrad per year (95% CI: 363-444; p<.001). Importantly, 78% of radiation in the operative group was attributable to the operative fluoroscopy exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences exist in the total radiation exposure in scoliosis patients with different treatment regimens, with operative patients receiving approximately 8 to 14 times more radiation than braced patients or those undergoing observation alone, respectively. Operative patients also receive more than twice the radiation per year than braced or observed patients. Almost 78% of the annual radiation exposure for operative patients occurs intraoperatively. Because children are notably more sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation, judicious use of present imaging methods and a search for newer imaging methods with limited ionizing radiation should be undertaken.",eng,0

Methods: Nonlinear calibration curves were established for OSLDs and RTQA2 radiochromic film using the Intrabeam 50 kV<inf>p</inf> source. Measurements were taken in a water phantom and compared to absolute dose measurements taken with an ionization chamber to investigate the characteristics of both types of dosimeters, including energy response and radiative absorption. In vivo readings were taken on the skin and in the tumor cavity using OSLDs and RTQA2 radiochromic film for 10 patients and 20 patients respectively. A prescription of 20 Gy to the surface of the applicator was used for all in vivo measurements in this study. Results: OSLDs were found to have an approximate uncertainty of +/-7% for readings near the surface of the applicator and +/-17% for readings at distances typical to the skin. The radiative absorption by OSLD was negative, indicating that this type of dosimeter absorbs less radiation than water in the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy energy range. RTQA2 film exhibited no energy dependence and all film readings were within +/-8% of the delivered dose. The maximum radiative absorption in film was 8.5%. Radiochromic film measurements were found to be on average 18.2 +/- 3.3 Gy for the tumor cavity and 2.1 +/- 0.8 Gy for positions on the skin superior and inferior to the Intrabeam applicator. Average cavity measurements taken with OSLDs were 15.9 +/- 3.9 Gy and average skin doses were 1.4 +/- 0.8 Gy. Conclusions: OSLDs produce results with an uncertainty comparable to other dosimeters near the surface of the applicator but the uncertainty increases to an unacceptably high level with distance from the applicator. RTQA2 radiochromic film is shown to be accurate both at the surface of the applicator and at distances of 1-2 cm. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",,1

Zenone,2003.0,[Modulation of the axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer],", ","Several studies showed the reliability of the sentinel lymph node (SN) technique in the evaluation of the N parameter in breast cancer so much to induce surgeons to limit the axillary dissection to the biopsy of the SN alone (SNB) in case this is negative to the extemporaneous examination. After a period of focusing on the identification technique, biopsy and histological examination of the SN (October 97-January 98) always followed by a complete dissection of the three axillary node levels (ALND), we started a study to evaluate the reliability of a limited dissection of the 1st level of the axilla (FLND) in women with T < 3 cm, N0-1a, M0, that did not undergo any neoadjuvant treatment and in which the SN resulted free from metastases. We started this phase of the study in February 1998 till May 2001. In the present paper we show the results related to this period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 256 women with T < 3 cm, N0-1a, M0. In 49 cases we used vital dye, in 23 dye + radioguided surgery (RGS) and in 184 RGS only. The extemporaneous histological examination of the SN has been performed with thin sections, dyed with EE. When SN was negative to the intraoperative examination, we limited the dissection to the 1st level of the axilla, except that in 3 patients, with SN located to the 2nd level, in which we did an ALND. The FLND has been performed in 17 cases with a minimally invasive technique. The definitive histological examination of the SN always included the immunohistochemistry. If the SN was positive, usually underestimated to the intraoperative examination, the patients had an adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: In 203/207 patients (98.1%) SN was found to the pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy. During surgery the SN was identified in 46/49 (94%) using the vital dye, in 22/23 (96%) using the vital dye + RGS and in 176/179 (98.3%) using RGS. To the extemporaneous histological examination SN was negative in 140, metastatic in 101; to the histological definitive results of the SN we noticed 6 false negative, since others lymph nodes than SN were positive (4 cases) or for evidence of micrometastases at the immunohistochemistry which were not detected at the extemporaneous examination (2 cases). On 107 cases of N+ the SN was the only metastatic lymph node in 42 (39.3%). The false negative percentage was 5.6% and the diagnostic accuracy of the SNB was 97.5%. In the group treated with FLND we only noticed two cases of light lymphedema (1.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in concordance with the international literature and they induced us, from June 2001, to begin a new phase of the study in which we limit the dissection of the axilla to the SN only, if not metastatic, in women with T1 breast carcinoma.",ita,0

Recent published reports have demonstrated that not all patients with early stage breast cancer need the entire breast irradiated for local control of their disease. To address the difficulties of several weeks of irradiation treatment, investigators have utilized different radiation techniques and treatment schedules that reduce the overall treatment time without compromising outcome. Patients and methods. An analysis was made of 7 patients treated on protocol with local intraoperative radiation (IORT) alone to the lumpectomy site after surgery with or without axillary dissection. All patients received IORT with 120 kV x-rays to the tumor bed at the time of resection. Doses ranged from 1500 cGy to 2000 cGy. Three patients were stage I, two stage IIA, and two stage IIB. Results. With a mean follow up of 123 months (range 86 to 139 months), two of seven patients developed a local recurrence which were treated with mastectomy. The disease specific survival is 100% and overall survival is 86% with one patient being dead without disease. The cosmetic outcome of the 5 patients with their treated breast remaining have expressed satisfaction with the results. No treatment related complications have occurred. Conclusions. The results o four pilot study support the findings that not all patients with early stage breast cancer need the entire breast irradiated for durable local control of their disease.

We describe our experience in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital (RHCH) in Winchester, the only DGH in the UK to participate in the trial. Methods: 112 patients were recruited from September 2008 to June 2012, of which 96 were recruited prior to surgery. 57 were randomised to receive intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT), of which five with pre-determined risk factors were given additional external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). All patients adhered to the trial protocol and data was recorded prospectively. Results: Most patients recruited had good-prognosis tumours (73% screen detected, median diameter 14 mm (range 5-70 mm), 79.5% nongrade 3, 80.4% node negative). The median duration of surgery was longer for the IORT group (100 min IORT (range 45-215 min) versus 70 min EBRT (range 35-270 min), p < 0.0001) although length of stay was similar (76.8% IORT versus 83% EBRT day case, p = ns), and complication rates were low in both groups (3 IORT versus 4 EBRT, p = ns). Conclusions: IORT can be successfully and safely delivered to shortstay patients in a DGH, with low complication rates. The extra time spent in theatre was offset by the avoidance of EBRT in more than 90% of patients. Patient interest led to recruitment levels in the top 30% of participating centres, highlighting the valuable role that DGHs can play in such clinical trials.",,0

The traditional period of expansion, however, continues to be a significant source of patient inconvenience and dissatisfaction. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a protocol for rapid tissue expansion. A total of 370 breast reconstructions in 314 patients who underwent rapid tissue expansion were retrospectively reviewed. Contraindications to rapid expansion were considered to be previous radiation, mastectomy skin flaps of questionable viability, and an excessively tight skin envelope. All expanders were placed submuscularly and filled to 40 to 50 percent of tissue expander volume. Office expansion was undertaken within 10 to 14 days after the operation and continued on a weekly basis. Each expansion was limited by patient tolerance up to a maximal pressure of 40 mm of water or a volume of 120 cm3. Expansion was considered complete once the expanded breast was 30 to 50 percent larger than the contralateral breast. If required, postoperative chemotherapy was given during the expansion period. Mean patient age was 48 years (range, 23 to 73 years). Two hundred fifty-eight patients had unilateral reconstructions. Three hundred two patients had immediate reconstruction. Mean tissue expander size was 583 cm3 (SD, 108 cm3). Mean intraoperative expansion was 271 cm3, or 46 percent (SD, 9 percent) of the tissue expander size. The first expansion was started 12 days (SD, 3 days) after the operation. The mean volume of each expansion was 88 cm3 (SD, 23 cm3). Expansion was completed in 4.7 office visits (SD, one visit). Mean final expander volume was 672 cm3 (SD, 144 cm3). The expanders were overexpanded by 15.3 percent (SD, 8.4 percent). The mean time between expander placement and the final expansion was 6.6 weeks (SD, 3 weeks). The overall complication rate was 4 percent. Ten patients developed cellulitis, five patients had hematomas requiring drainage, and one expander became exposed. A total of eight expanders were removed: four for cellulitis, one for a hematoma, one because of locally recurrent disease, one because of expander exposure, and one at the patient's request for no medical reason. Intraoperative and rapid postoperative tissue expansion is a safe and reliable technique that offers a significant improvement over conventional techniques. In this accelerated protocol, expansion may be completed in less than 7 weeks. The result is decreased patient morbidity and delays in adjuvant therapy at no detriment to the final surgical outcome.",eng,0

However, the safety and tolerability of (125)I seed sequential irradiation therapy remain unclear, there is no unified standard of brachytherapy radiation dose, and further study on the basic radiobiology of continuous rate irradiation is necessary. METHODS: Forty Kunming-mice (KM-mice, China) were injected with suspensions of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (H22) to create an animal model and mimic (125)I seed implantation. The survival rates of mice, curative effect, pathological impairments including apoptosis and necrosis were investigated. The mice were randomly divided into four groups, A, B, C and D. In group A, 0.78 mCi (125)I seeds were implanted into the tumor focus. In groups B and C, 0.58 mCi and 0.38 mCi (125)I seeds were inserted at the same location, respectively. Group D was a control group, without any treatment. After 28 days of therapy, the survival rates and the tumor size were measured, and pathological impairments was measured by light or electron microscopy. RESULTS: The tumor volume inhibition rate was 68.21% +/- 3.21%, 51.38% +/- 4.96%, and 35.71% +/- 2.79% after 0.78 mCi, 0.58 mCi, and 0.38 mCi (125)I seeds irradiation, respectively. However, radiation-related side effects were also observed in the high-dose group. Pathological results showed that radiation effect was closely associated with radiation dose, as the increase of radiation dose, an increase in apoptosis and necrosis was detected. Significant cellular impairments were noted by pathological analysis under electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the Kunming-mouse is an ideal animal to study (125)I brachytherapy, and the curative effect was closely associated with radiation dose. High-dose of brachytherapy may effectively increase apoptosis and necrosis in liver cells in KM-mice.

METHODS: All patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy between 2012 and 2014 were included in a prospective analysis. Internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) was performed in all patients with IM-SLN visualized on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and/or detected by intraoperative gamma probe detection. The adjuvant treatment plan was adjusted according to the current guidelines. RESULTS: In a total of 349 patients, 249 patients (71.1%) showed internal mammary drainage. IM-SLNB was performed in 153 patients with internal mammary drainage, with a success rate of IM-SLNB of 97.4% (149/153). Pleural lesion and internal mammary artery bleeding were found in 7.2% and 5.2% patients, respectively. In 8.1% of patients (12/149) the IM-SLN was tumor positive. In the group of patients who underwent IM-SLNB, lymph node staging was changed in 8.1% of patients, and IMLNs radiotherapy was guided by these results, however, systemic treatment was changed in only 0.7% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: IM-SLNB has a high successful rate and good safety. Identification of internal mammary metastases through IM-SLNB may provide more accurate staging and guide the tailored internal mammary radiotherapy.

The algorithmic procedure begins by cropping the 3-D US image containing a needle; then all voxels in the cropped 3-D image are grouped into different line support regions (LSRs) based on the outer product of the adjacent voxels' gradient vector. Two different needle axis extraction methods in the candidate LSR are presented: least-squares fitting and 3-D randomized Hough transform. Subsequent local optimization refines the position of the needle axis. Finally, the needle endpoint is localized by finding an intensity drop along the needle axis. The proposed methods were validated with 3-D TRUS tissue-mimicking agar phantom images, chicken breast phantom images and patient images obtained during prostate cryotherapy. The results of the in vivo test indicate that our method can localize the needle accurately and robustly with a needle endpoint localization accuracy <1.43 mm and detection accuracy >84%, which are favorable for 3-D TRUS-guided prostate trans-perineal therapy.",eng,0

Randomized studies have reported that delivering boost doses to tumor bed improves local control rates, particularly in young women. This study sought to evaluate local control and cosmetic results of delivering boost doses using a high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (HDRBT) in breast cancer conservative treatment. METHODS: We included 621 T1-T2, N0-N1 breast cancer patients who underwent lumpectomy, external irradiation (44Gy over 5weeks), and a boost dose of two fractions of 5Gy to the tumor bed by means of HDR iridium brachytherapy. Implantation was performed during the lumpectomy or 2-3weeks after external irradiation. Population characteristics were as follows: pTis=11.6%; pT1=63.4%; pT2=25.0%; median tumor size=1.5cm; histology: ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): 72 (11.6%); infiltrative ductal carcinoma (IDC): 471 (75.8%); other: 78 (12.6%). For IDCs, the surgical margins were positive in 38cases (6.2%) and an extensive intraductal component was present in 254 cases. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 10.3years, 47 local relapses were observed (10-year local relapse rate: 7.4%). Small-volume implantation (V100<45cc) and ductal carcinoma in situ histology both significantly correlated with local relapse. The 10-year overall survival was 91%. Cosmetic results were evaluated in 264patients, proving excellent in 58 (22%), good in 153 (58%), fair in 40 (15%), and poor in 13 (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Small implant volume and ductal carcinoma in situ histology significantly correlated with local relapse following HDR brachytherapy dose boost in breast cancer conservative treatment. Modern image-guided breast brachytherapy techniques using surgical clips as a guide may decrease potential treatment targeting errors, consequently improving local control without increasing toxicity.",Eng,0

This report presents the year-5 toxicity and cosmesis data. METHODS AND MATERIALS: After lumpectomy and axillary dissection for invasive BrCa (tumor size <3cm with zero to three positive lymph nodes), 100 patients (pts), 98 evaluable, were treated (txed) with mCathBrachy from 1997 to 2000 with 34Gy administered twice daily in 10 high-dose-rate fractions or 45Gy in 3.5-6 days as a low-dose-rate implant to 1-2cm beyond the lumpectomy bed. The PROs and physician-reported outcomes of toxicity, cosmesis, and tx satisfaction at year-5 are reported here, defined as data submitted 54-78 months after tx. RESULTS: Grade (G) 1-2 skin toxicity developed in 78% of the pts and G3 in 13% (no G4). The tx effects included skin dimpling/indentation (37%), fibrosis (45%), telangiectasias (45%), skin catheter marks (54%), and symptomatic fat necrosis (15%). Breast asymmetry was reported in 73%. Rates of excellent-to-good cosmesis were similar between PROs (66%) and radiation oncologists (68%). The PROs of tx satisfaction at year-5 was 75%. CONCLUSIONS: RTOG 95-17 documents the year-5 skin toxicity and tx effects of mCathBrachy APBI, which are associated with PROs of good-to-excellent cosmesis and high tx satisfaction. This emphasizes the importance of PROs when assessing BrCa tx.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients, initially treated by conservative surgery and radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) were treated from 1998 to 2001 for a local relapse by salvage mastectomy and re-irradiation (either electron or photon beams). Mean age was 53 years (31-71). Reasons for re-irradiation were that the local relapses were inflammatory (4 pts), multifocal (5 pts), cutaneous (5 pts), involved the nipple (3 pts) or because the surgical margins (either muscle or skin) were involved (3 pts). The median dose of re-irradiation was 45 Gy (33-65) in 15 fractions over 33 days. Mean follow-up was 48 months (5-97). RESULTS: Fifteen patients remained free of a second local recurrence and 10 were still alive, without metastasis. Neither the dose of re-irradiation nor the irradiated surfaces were prognostic factors of local control (P = 0.877 and P = 0.424). Five patients developed radiation-induced pneumonitis without functional respiratory impairment. The incidence of pneumonitis seemed to be related to the biological dose of re-irradiation (P = 0.037). Other late complications occurred such as pigmentation changes (12 pts), telangiectasia (8 pts), chondritis (2 pts), parietal fibrosis (7 pts), rib fractures (4 pts), severe pain (11 pts) and lymphedema (2 pts). The increase in biological equivalent dose was highly statistically linked with the occurrence of disabling pain (P = 0.0123). CONCLUSION: Parietal re-irradiation achieves good and lasting local control with an acceptable rate of acute complications but with a risk of disabling late sequelae such as severe pain.",fre,0

Metastases to the breast from extramammarian carcinomas are extremely rare and account for 1-6% of all breast malgnancies. Mostly gastric and lung carcinomas, lymphoma and malignant melanoma are the most freuquently nonmammary metastases. Colorectal carcinoma as a metasis in the breast are very uncommon. We presented a case of poorly differentiated colon cancer metastatic to the breast. Case presentation. A 79-year-old caucasian woman who was diagnosed with primary colon adenocarcinoma stage Duke C in 2010 and treated with right hemycolectomy and chemotherapy (Folfox 10 cycles). Six month after chemotherapy a tumor in the right upper quadrant of the breast was discovered incidentally during re-staging. Patients received segment resection of the right breast, sentinel node biopsy and intraoperative radiation. Postoperative pathology results showed an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma which could be identified as a metastasis from the primary colorectal carcinoma. Conclusion. Colorectal metastases in the breast are extremely seldom and there is no general therapy standard. Very important in the management of this occurrence is a multidisciplinary approach to provide best treatment for the patient.",,0

Materials and Methods: The Xoft Axxent miniature x-ray source operating at 50 kVp was used for all of the measurements in this work. The phantom consisted of a combination of (30x30) cm<sup>2</sup> and (35x35) cm<sup>2</sup> Virtual Waterx (VW) slabs of varying thickness. A (30x30x2) cm<sup>3</sup> VW holder was machined for the Axxenta source such that the center of the source was positioned at the center of the holder. The holder was placed on a (35x35x5) cm<sup>3</sup> piece of VW and additional slabs of VW were added above the source holder to achieve source to surface distances of 3, 4, 5, and 6 cm. For each source to surface distance, TLD measurements were made with four backscatter conditions: no backscatter, FlexiShielda, 15 cm of VW, and FlexiShielda plus 15 cm of VW. The FlexiShielda is a flexible silicone and tungsten sheet that is draped on the patient's breast during accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with the Axxenta source. Calibration TLDs were irradiated with <sup>60</sup>Co. The intrinsic energy dependence of the TLDs for the Axxent source relative to <sup>60</sup>Co was determined with additional experiments and the appropriate correction was applied to the phantom measurements. Additional correction factors were applied to relate the dose measured by the TLD to the dose to water at the phantom surface. Each of the phantom geometries was modeled in the MCNP5 Monte Carlo code. The source was modeled as a point source with a realistic spectrum for the Axxenta source operating at 50 kVp. Also, TG-43 calculations were made for each source to surface distance using the published TG-43 parameters for the Axxenta source operating at 50 kVp. Results: The effect of backscatter on the TLD measured surface dose is summarized in Table 1, which shows the difference in the TLD measured dose for each backscatter condition relative to the TLD measured dose with no backscatter. (Table presented) The TLD measured doses agreed well with the MC calculated doses when the appropriate corrections were applied. The TG-43 calculated doses agreed well with the measurements simulating full backscatter conditions (15 cm VW), but over-estimated the exit dose for the measurements made with no backscatter by up to 16% at 3 cm and by up to 23% at 6 cm. The addition of the FlexiShielda increased the TLD measured dose by up to 4%, but did not compensate for the amount of backscatter assumed by TG-43 calculations. Conclusions: TG-43 calculations used for electronic brachytherapy treatment planning overestimate the exit skin dose for intracavitary APBI. TLDs can accurately measure the exit dose when the appropriate corrections are applied.",,0

Godfrey",2005.0,"Technology for automated, rapid, and quantitative PCR or reverse transcription-PCR clinical testing",10.1373/clinchem.2004.046474,"BACKGROUND: PCR-based assays can improve clinical care, but they remain technically demanding and labor-intensive. We describe a new instrument, the GeneXpert, that performs automated nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription, and fluorescence-based quantitative PCR in approximately 35 min. METHODS: Yield and integrity of RNA isolated on the GeneXpert were compared with Qiagen-based extraction for parallel samples (5-microm frozen tissue sections). The reproducibility of automated RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and quantitative PCR was determined by replicate (n = 10) analysis of 10 tissues, using duplex (target and endogenous control) reverse transcription-PCR reactions for two gene combinations. The GeneXpert was then used to perform rapid analysis of lymph nodes from melanoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer patients and analysis of melanoma metastatic to the lung, primary lung adenocarcinoma, and healthy lung tissue. RESULTS: On the GeneXpert, RNA was recovered in slightly over 6 min, and the yield was approximately 70% of that from parallel Qiagen reactions. The RNA integrity was comparable to that of Qiagen-isolated RNA as determined by gel electrophoresis. For the melanoma samples, the 95% prediction interval for the deltaCt for a new measurement was +/-1.54 cycles, and for breast cancer samples, the interval for a newly observed deltaCt was +/-1.40 cycles. GeneXpert assays successfully detected the presence of metastatic melanoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer in lymph nodes and also differentiated among metastatic melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and healthy lung. CONCLUSIONS: RNA yield and integrity on the GeneXpert are comparable to benchtop methods. Reproducibility of the GeneXpert data is similar to that seen with manual methods in our hands but may need improvement for some applications. The GeneXpert can perform RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and quantitative PCR in approximately 35 min and could therefore be used for intraoperative testing when applicable.",eng,0

Materials/Methods: Patients treated from January 1, 2011 to January 31, 2014 with early stage breast cancer with breast conserving surgery and IORT at our institution were included. Recurrences, wound complications, and/or fat necrosis were assessed at subsequent follow-up visits. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess risk factors leading to an increase in complication rates. Clinical exams and radiologic imaging was used to assess recurrence. Results: One hundred fourteen patients were identified with two undergoing bilateral treatment. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics are presented in table 1. Average length of time for IORT was 32 minutes 32 seconds (15:50-55:18). Six patients underwent additional surgery while 16 received external beam radiation (EBRT). Average follow-up was 11.7 months (0-32.8) for all patients. Nine patients were found to have wound complications while two had fat necrosis on follow-up. Of risk factors including age at the time of surgery (p=0.21), tumor size (p=0.85), age at last follow-up (p = 0.21), additional EBRT (p = 0.09), only applicator size (p < 0.01) showed a statistical significance increase in wound complications. There was one image detected and biopsy proven ipsilateral recurrence for which the patient elected to undergo a mastectomy. Conclusions: Applicator size was the only variable in our subset of patients which led to an increase in wound complications (7.7%) and fat necrosis (1.7%) following IORT for early stage breast cancer. IORT is a safe treatment for a select group of patients leading to a minimal increase in complication rates following lumpectomy. (Table Presented).",,0
Journal Article,A. Rammohan; J. J. Wood,2012.0,Desmoid tumour of the breast as a manifestation of Gardner's syndrome,10.1016/j.ijscr.2012.01.004,"INTRODUCTION: Desmoid tumours of the breast are rare. Although benign, they can mimic breast cancer on physical examination, mammography and breast ultrasound and can also be locally invasive. Even though they occur sporadically, they can also be seen as a part of Gardner's syndrome. We describe a case of desmoid tumour in a woman with Gardner's syndrome where the lesion was mammographically occult. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 63-year old woman presented with four months history of a painful left breast lump. She had a screening mammogram seven months ago which was normal. She is known to have Gardner's syndrome and had a total colectomy, she has also had multiple abdominal desmoids excised in the past. On examination there was a 4cmx5cm firm, mobile lump in the left breast. Her mammograms in the clinic were also normal. Ultrasound suggested a benign lesion of the breast and a core biopsy showed it to be a benign spindle cell lesion. She underwent wide local excision of the lump, the intraoperative mammograms of the excised specimen also failed to detect the lesion. Histopathology of the excised specimen confirmed the tumour to be a benign desmoid tumour. She has now been offered radiotherapy and nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce her chances of a local recurrence. CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion and a thorough triple examination protocol is necessary to detect rare lesions like a desmoid tumour which can masquerade as breast carcinoma.",eng,0

One-hundred-seventy-eight patients enrolled in a prospective randomized phase III trial to compare the efficacy of ELIOT (a single dose of 21 Gy prescribed at the 90% isodose) versus EBRT (50 Gy to the whole breast plus a 10 Gy boost to the tumour bed), underwent a spiral 16-detector row Computed Tomography (CT) examination to assess RT-induced pulmonary fibrosis: 83 patients in the EBRT arm and 95 in the ELIOT arm. All patients (age range 48-75 years) were affected by unicentric infiltrating carcinoma of the breast with diameter < 2.5 cm. This study was approved by our Institutional Ethical Committee and informed consent was obtained from each patient. Two observers, blinded to patient's randomization, independently evaluated each CT examination and assigned a fibrosis score (Grades 0 to 3). Inter-observer agreement for the fibrosis score was evaluated and a consensus between observers was obtained. Differences in fibrosis score between the two arms were evaluated by Chi Square test and Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Pulmonary fibrosis was diagnosed in 42 patients (23.6%): 38 (90%) were in the EBRT arm and 4 (10%) in the ELIOT arm (p < 0.0001); twenty-six of them were Grade 1 (one ELIOT), fifteen were Grade 2 (three ELIOT) and one was Grade 3. The post-radiotherapy risk in the EBRT arm to develop at least Grade 1 fibrosis was 19 times higher than in the ELIOT one (OR: 19.20; 95%CI: 6.46-57.14) and 6 times higher to develop at least Grade 2 (OR: 5.70; 95%CI: 1.56-20.76).

Hong,2015.0,Comparative dosimetric findings using accelerated partial breast irradiation across five catheter subtypes,10.1186/s13014-015-0468-7,"PURPOSE: Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with balloon and strut adjusted volume implants (SAVI) show promising results with excellent tumor control and minimal toxicity. Knowing the factors that contribute to a high skin dose, rib dose, and D95 coverage may reduce toxicity, improve tumor control, and help properly predict patient outcomes following APBI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis of 594 patients treated with brachytherapy based APBI at a single institution from May 2008 to September 2014 was grouped by applicator subtype. Patients were treated to a total of 34 Gy (3.4 Gy x 10 fractions over 5 days delivered BID) targeting a planning target volume (PTV) 1.0 cm beyond the lumpectomy cavity using a high dose rate source. RESULTS: SAVI devices had the lowest statistically significant values of DmaxSkin (81.00 +/- 29.83), highest values of D90 (101.50 +/- 3.66), and D95 (96.09 +/- 4.55). SAVI-mini devices had the lowest statistically significant values of DmaxRib (77.66 +/- 32.92) and smallest V150 (18.01 +/- 3.39). Multi-lumen balloons were able to obtain the smallest V200 (5.89 +/- 2.21). Strut-based applicators were more likely to achieve a DmaxSkin and a DmaxRib less than or equal to 100 %. The effect of PTV on V150 showed a strong positive relationship (p < .001). PTV and DmaxSkin showed a weak negative relationship in multi-lumen applicators (p = .016) and SAVI-mini devices (p < .001). PTV and DmaxRib showed a weak negative relationship in multi-lumen applicators (p = .009), SAVI devices (p < .001), and SAVI-mini devices (p < .001). CONCLUSION: PTV volume is strongly correlated with V150 in all devices and V200 in strut based devices. Larger PTV volumes result in greater V150 and V200, which could help predict potential risks for hotspots and resulting toxicities in these devices. PTV volume is also weakly negatively correlated with max skin dose and max rib dose, meaning that as the PTV volumes increase one can expect slightly smaller max skin and rib doses. Strut based applicators are significantly more effective in keeping skin and rib dose constraints under 125 and 100 % when compared to any balloon based applicator.",eng,0

These advances, in both oncological and plastic surgery, have led to a new specialisation, namely oncoplastic breast surgery, which enables us to undertake large resections and, with advance planning, to prevent subsequent deformities. This is particularly important when more than 30% of the breast volume is removed, as it allows us to obtain precise information for conservative surgery according to the site of the lesion, and also allows us to set the boundary between conservative surgery and mastectomy. Given the existence of new alloplastic materials and new reconstructive techniques, it is essential for our patients that surgeons involved in breast cancer treatment are trained in both the oncological as well as the reconstructive and aesthetic fields, to enable them to provide the best loco-regional treatment with the best cosmetic results. © the authors licensee ecancermedicalscience.",,0

Thus, giving radiation to the tumor bed only may be adequate for selected patients. Published data from the TARGIT trial have shown that IORT is effective in treating select early stage invasive breast cancer; albeit with short-term follow up. We reviewed our single institution experience regarding the use of IORT after lumpectomy for patients with invasive breast cancer. Material/Methods: Between 2005 and 2011, 57 patients with invasive breast cancer were treated with lumpectomy and IORT prescribed to 5 Gy at 1.0 cm from the applicator surface. Median age at diagnosis was 60 (range, 41 to 87). The size of the invasive breast cancers ranged from 0.25 cm to 2.8 cm. Every patient had either a sentinel lymph node biopsy or a full lymph node dissection, and six (10.5%) of the patients were lymph node positive, two of which received their whole breast radiation at our institution. No one had more than one lymph node positive. Modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) scores ranged from 4 to 9 out of 9. Five patients were ER/PR and HER2/neu negative. The rest were ER/PR positive and HER2/neu negative. Margins were all negative and ranged from 2 mm to >10mm. Actuarial local control was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier Method. Results: At a median follow up of 26.8 months, there was one local recurrence in the 57 patients treated, with a five-year actuarial local control of 94%. This patient was 74 years old at diagnosis that had a 1.5 cm invasive ductal carcinoma with SBR of 6 out of 9, ER/PR positive and HER2/neu negative. Despite a 10mm negative margin, the patient developed recurrence in the treated area 55 months later. Conclusions: For selected patients with invasive breast cancer, IORT is a feasible treatment option and may be considered as an alternative to conventional whole breast radiation and/or other forms of partial breast radiation. Longer follow-up is needed to prove equal efficacy when compared to the gold standard of whole breast radiation.",,0

The size of the DCIS ranged from 0.2 cm to 3.6 cm. The range in age at diagnosis was 45-79 years old. Eleven patients (49%) had high-grade tumors and eight (35%) had comedonecrosis. Margins were negative in all patients and ranged from 0.28 cm to >1.0 cm. Hormone receptor status was known for all patients with 17 (74%) having ER+ disease. Actuarial local control was calculated using the Kaplan- Meier method. Results: The median follow-up was 18.3 months. The 3-year actuarial local control rate was 93.3%. One recurrence was noted 12 months after IORT in close proximity to tumor bed. This patients was 49 years old at diagnosis and had a 1.2 cm DCIS, grade 3, with solid and cribriform pattern, ER/PR+, and a 0.5 cm closest superior margin. She did not receive endocrine therapy. Conclusion: For selected patients with DCIS, IORT is a feasible treatment option and may be considered as an alternative to conventional whole breast radiation and/or other forms of partial breast radiation. Longer follow-up is needed to prove that this treatment technique offers equal efficacy when compared to the gold standard of whole breast radiation.",,0
Journal Article,A. J. Rathmell; D. V. Ash,1991.0,Radiotherapy after conservative surgery for breast cancer: selective use of iridium-192 wire boost to tumour bed in high risk patients,", ","The results of treatment for 51 patients referred for radiotherapy after local excision of an 'early' breast carcinoma are reviewed. The patients were considered to be at particularly high risk of local recurrence due to the presence of one or more adverse histological features, most commonly microscopic involvement of resection margins. The patients received a course of whole-breast irradiation (40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks) but instead of following this with a routine photon or electron tumour-bed boost (15 Gy in five fractions) these patients received an iridium-192 wire implant, giving a tumour-bed boost of 25 Gy over approximately 3 days. After a median follow-up of 38 months, five patients have recurred locally within the breast, giving an actuarial breast recurrence-free survival of 87.8% at 8 years. Four patients have died of metastatic breast cancer, none of whom had uncontrolled local disease. Cosmesis was good or excellent in 76% of cases. The presence of microscopic tumour at resection margins or other adverse histological features is not, therefore, necessarily an indication for further surgery, as a good level of local control can still be achieved with radiotherapy providing a relatively high-dose tumour-bed boost is employed using an iridium-192 wire implant.",eng,0

Pignol,2008.0,Experimental evaluation of an online gamma-camera imaging of permanent seed implantation (OGIPSI) prototype for partial breast irradiation,10.1118/1.2919559,"Previously, our team used Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate that a gamma camera could potentially be used as an online image guidance device to visualize seeds during permanent breast seed implant procedures. This could allow for intraoperative correction if seeds have been misplaced. The objective of this study is to describe an experimental evaluation of an online gamma-camera imaging of permanent seed implantation (OGIPSI) prototype. The OGIPSI device is intended to be able to detect a seed misplacement of 5 mm or more within an imaging time of 2 min or less. The device was constructed by fitting a custom built brass collimator (16 mm height, 0.65 mm hole pitch, 0.15 mm septal thickness) on a 64 pixel linear array CZT detector (eValuator-2000, eV Products, Saxonburg, PA). Two-dimensional projection images of seed distributions were acquired by the use of a digitally controlled translation stage. Spatial resolution and noise characteristics of the detector were measured. The ability and time needed for the OGIPSI device to image the seeds and to detect cold spots was tested using an anthropomorphic breast phantom. Mimicking a real treatment plan, a total of 52 103Pd seeds of 65.8 MBq each were placed on three different layers at appropriate depths within the phantom. The seeds were reliably detected within 30 s with a median error in localization of 1 mm. In conclusion, an OGIPSI device can potentially be used for image guidance of permanent brachytherapy applications in the breast and, possibly, other sites.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-eight postmenopausal patients with early stage breast cancer and no nodal metastases, treated with partial breast irradiation using the MammoSite catheter from June 2003 to November 2007 were analyzed retrospectively for CSS predictive factors and incidence of infection. After a lumpectomy, a MammoSite catheter was placed by intraoperative open-cavity technique (OCT). All the patients received wound care and prophylactic antibiotics. A dose of 3400 cGy was prescribed at 1cm from the surface of the balloon and was delivered at 340 cGy twice daily 6h apart for 5 days. The patients with seroma who underwent intervention were considered to have CSS. On the basis of the characteristics and symptoms associated with seroma, interventions, such as aspiration, core biopsy, or re-excision of the lumpectomy cavity were performed either to relieve symptoms or to rule out a local recurrence. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of the 58 patients were eligible for analysis. One patient, who died 4 weeks after treatment from unrelated causes, was excluded from final analysis. All the patients were postmenopausal, with a median age of 71 years (range, 53-88 years). Eighteen of the 57 patients (31.5%) had CSS; 9 of them had re-excision of the lumpectomy cavity. Pathology in all revealed evidence of fat necrosis, chronic inflammatory cells, and fibrosis. There was no evidence of tumor recurrence in any of these patients. Technical and nontechnical parameters were analyzed to determine possible risk factors for CSS, and none were found to be statistically significant. No patient developed acute postprocedural infection. CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous wound care and postoperative antibiotics prevented acute infection. Infection was not a contributing factor for seroma formation in these patients. Placement of the MammoSite catheter by OCT did not increase the risk of CSS development, in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.",eng,0

Nori,2011.0,MammoSite multilumen catheter: dosimetry considerations,10.4103/0973-1482.80469,"PURPOSE: To explore the dosimetric advantages of the new MammoSite multilumen (ML) balloon for breast brachytherapy treatment compared to conventional single lumen (SL) device plan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients deemed appropriate for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) were implanted with the MammoSite ML balloon. Two plans were generated in each patient for the same target coverage (PTV_EVAL) and dose to normal structures were plotted. The first plan used only the central single lumen with single-dwell position (SL), and the second plan (ML) was generated using the other lumens of the device. Dose distributions of the SL and ML plans were compared. RESULTS: For the same PTV_EVAL, the ML balloon improved dose coverage at the tip and base of the applicator compared to SL plan. The skin and rib doses were reduced using the ML plan versus SL plan for the same PTV_EVAL in-patient 2, where the skin-balloon distance was 7 mm and the rib-balloon distance was <1 cm. For patient 1, the skin and rib distances were greater than 1 cm and the ML plan did not further minimize the dose to normal structures. CONCLUSION: In our initial experience, dosimetric goals can be better achieved using the ML MammoSite balloon when normal structures (skin and ribs) are close to PTV_EVAL with a distance of <7 mm and rib distance of <1 cm. The multiple lumen of ML balloon can optimize dose and reduce excessive dose to rib and skin and therefore minimize the long-term toxicities of rib discomfort, skin fibrosis and fat necrosis.",eng,0

Schmidt,2016.0,BRCA2-positive spinal intramedullary ovarian metastatic disease: case report,10.1016/j.spinee.2015.10.053,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women, but advances in treatment have led to longer survival among these patients. Tied to these advances and increased survival, however, have been new patterns of metastatic spread. PURPOSE: The authors discuss the management and surgical decision making in patients with intramedullary ovarian metastatic disease using a case illustration and relevant literature. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A case report was used. METHODS: The authors describe a case of a 59-year-old woman with Breast Cancer gene (BRCA) 2-positive ovarian cancer who developed progressive myelopathy from a T10 to T11 intramedullary metastatic lesion. RESULTS: The patient underwent a standard open T10-T11 laminectomy for intramedullary tumor resection. Intraoperative ultrasound was used to direct the dural opening over the lesion. After a posterior midline myelotomy, microsurgical dissection revealed the intramedullary tumor with a discolored fibrous capsule, which was carefully dissected off of the spinal tracts, and a gross total resection was achieved. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months demonstrated no evidence of residual or recurrent intramedullary tumor. The patient underwent adjuvant external beam radiation to the thoracic spine but succumbed to her primary disease 1 year after surgery. CONCLUSION: Although central nervous system involvement of ovarian cancer confers a poor prognosis, patients presenting with a solitary lesion and neurologic deficit may benefit from surgical resection followed by steroids and radiation therapy, especially when tissue diagnosis is necessary.",eng,0

Kim",2011.0,Tissue expander breast reconstruction using prehydrated human acellular dermis,10.1097/SAP.0b013e3181f3ed0a,"INTRODUCTION: Human acellular dermal matrices help facilitate immediate tissue expander-implant breast reconstruction by providing support to the inferolateral pole, improving control of implant position, and enhancing early volume expansion. Although several freeze-dried human acellular dermal products have demonstrated reasonable safety and efficacy in immediate tissue expander-implant breast reconstruction, no dedicated studies have evaluated clinical outcomes of prehydrated human acellular dermal matrix (PHADM) in breast reconstruction. METHODS: The outcomes of 121 consecutive tissue expander reconstructions performed by the senior author using PHADM were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean intraoperative tissue expander fill volume was 256.6 +/- 133 mL, 60% of final expander volume. Patients required an average of 3.2 additional expansions prior to tissue expander-to-implant exchange. Mean follow-up period after reconstruction was 44 +/- 26.5 weeks. Complications occurred in 20 (16.5%) breasts, including 9 (7.4%) soft-tissue infections, 8 (6.6%) partial mastectomy flap necroses, and 2 (1.7%) seromas. Eleven (9.1%) breasts ultimately required explantation. Patients receiving radiation demonstrated a strong trend toward greater complications (30.8% vs. 13.7%, P = 0.0749). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes and complication rates of PHADM tissue expander breast reconstruction are comparable to those reported with freeze-dried human acellular dermis.",eng,0

The breast received 4500-5000 cGy (rad) using a 6 MV linear accelerator followed by a supplement to the area of the primary tumor of 2000 cGy (rad) using electrons in 99 patients (83%) and interstitial implantation in 21 patients (17%). Local recurrence was not recorded in the 43 patients with Stage I disease, while three of 77 patients (4%) with Stage II disease suffered a local recurrence. The actuarial five-year relapse-free survival was 91% and 60% in Stages I and II respectively. Cosmetic results were considered excellent by both physician and patient in the majority of cases. Axillary dissection was the recommended method of staging the axilla but was noted to be more morbid than axillary sampling.

METHODS: The probe was constructed with a plastic scintillator tip coupled to a photomultiplier tube with fiber optic cable. Anticipated resolution degradation was evaluated by measurement of line spread functions in the presence of background radiation. Realistic photon background distributions were simulated with a human torso phantom and a cardiac insert. The relationship between resolution and energy threshold was measured to find the optimal discriminator settings. In addition, probe sensitivity as a function of energy threshold was determined for various size-simulated tumors. Finally, the ability to localize breast cancers in vivo was tested in a rodent model. Mammary rat tumors implanted in Lewis rats were examined after injection with FDG; these results were correlated with those of histologic analyses. RESULTS: Measurements of line spread functions indicated that resolution could be maximized in a realistic background photon environment by increasing the energy threshold to levels at or above the Compton continuum edge (340 keV). At this setting, the probe's sensitivity was determined to be 58 and 11 cps/muCi for 3.18- and 6.35-mm diameter simulated tumors, respectively. Probe readings correlated well with histologic results: the probe was generally able to discriminate between tumor and normal tissue. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that breast cancer surgery guided by a positron-sensitive probe warrants future evaluation in breast-conserving surgery of patients with breast cancer.",eng,0

The patients' ages ranged from 39 to 69 years (mean 57 years); nine patients were female and three male. The average length of time from radiation to surgery was 15 years (3-24 years interval). The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of heart disease: Group I included seven patients who developed coronary artery disease (CAD) despite minimal risk factors. Three asymptomatic patients developed sudden myocardial infarction. In two patients the myocardial infarction was complicated (with ventricular septal defect in one and ventricular septal defect plus ventricular aneurysm in the other). All seven patients were surgically managed. Internal thoracic artery (ITA) was used in three patients as a conduit of myocardial revascularization. There were two hospital deaths in this group. The five patients in Group II underwent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenoses. Prior to the irradiation, none of the patients had a documented history of rheumatic fever, bacterial endocartitis, significant murmur, etc. There were no deaths in this group. Intraoperative findings for both groups included thickening and/or fibrosis of the ascending aortic wall, coronary arteries and aortic valve tissue.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated from January 2013 to July 2015 with SAVI planned for 10 b.i.d. fractions for a total dose of 34 Gy were included. Acute and late toxicities were prospectively collected on patients in followup and graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were included, with 1 patient having synchronous breast cancer treated in each breast. Median followup was 20.0 months (range, 2.7-37.4 months). The median age at diagnosis was 61 years (range, 41-83 years). Forty-two lesions (32%) were in situ, 88 lesions (66%) were Stage 1, and 3 (2%) lesions were Stage 2. The median planning target volume was 58.2 cc (range, 24.2-109.9 cc), median V150 was 26.3 cc (range, 11.5-47.5 cc), and median V200 was 13.0 cc (range, 6.3-26.1 cc). On a pain scale of 0-10 (10 = worst pain), pain was worst on Day 2 of treatment, with an average score of 0.46. There was one acute skin infection; there were three late skin infections, two of which was Grade 3. Other late toxicities were Grade 1 or 2: hyperpigmentation (44%), telangiectasia (0.8%), seroma (9%), fat necrosis (5%), and fibrosis (12%). Crude local recurrence rate was 4%.

Method: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in an international multicenter clinical trial to deliver an IOERT boost of 10 Gy using the Mobetron mobile linear accelerator (Intraop Medical Corp) followed by hypofractionated whole breast radiation (2.7 Gy in 15 fractions for a total of 40.5 Gy). Independent of that trial, a single breast surgeon at our institution used the following techniques to prepare the target tissues for IOERT: vertical, medial, lateral, Benelli and inverted-T mammoplasty. When appropriate, a contralateral mammoplasty for equalization was performed at the time of the original surgery. Photographs were obtained before and after surgery/IOERT and before and after whole-breast radiation. Results : Surgeries were performed from May 2011 to October 2012 using an oncoplastic approach to deliver the IOERT boost to targeted breast tissue. Mean follow-up time is 9.3 months. Of the 32 cases, only 3 required the assistance of a plastic surgeon to perform a breast reduction procedure. The oncoplastic approaches allowed placement of cones up to 7 cm in diameter over the target tissue without compromising surgical results. To date, there have been no significant complications or adverse effects associated with the use of oncoplastc surgery in combination with IOERT.

An important aspect is a differentiated knowledge about the short-term effects and long-term perspectives regarding levels of functioning and subjective well-being associated with different treatment strategies. The article focuses on available quality-of-life (QOL) measurement instruments in elderly patients with early breast cancer and the impact of various local or systemic treatments on QOL scores.A selective literature search was carried out in the PubMed database from January 2000 to May 2010 using the terms 'early breast cancer', 'elderly' and 'quality of life'. Contributions to international congresses on breast cancer in 2009 were also included. Of the 80 articles retrieved, 46 publications were excluded from further consideration due to failure to fulfil inclusion criteria (e.g. not restricted to the elderly, inclusion of patients with metastatic disease, no adjuvant treatment). Sixteen papers focusing on complementary treatment were also rejected. The remaining 18 articles were extensively reviewed.The selection of described QOL measurements was very heterogeneous in these 18 studies. Commonly used QOL instruments were the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy questionnaires (FACT-G, FACT-B) and its subscales. Additionally, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (MOS-SF-36), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) approach were used by various study groups. The general limitations of QOL assessment in the elderly population are discussed in the review.Surgery, when considered from a technical point of view, does not differ significantly with patient age. Furthermore, age in itself should not be a contraindication to breast-conserving surgery (BCS) because QOL appears somewhat better after conservative surgical treatment. Avoiding axillary surgery and undergoing sentinel lymph node dissection in elderly patients are both associated with better short-term QOL. However, conventional axillary surgery has little effect on long-term QOL in older women.The advent of innovative radiotherapy techniques has resulted in marked improvements in short-term tolerability together with reductions in the incidence and severity of late normal tissue damage. A potential alternative to conventional postoperative radiotherapy after BCS in the future is the intraoperative radiotherapy technique. Chemotherapy has considerable effects on QOL in breast cancer patients. Most studies found that overall QOL was maintained or improved in patients receiving either aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen but patients reported different adverse effects. For the majority of older breast cancer survivors, cancer-specific well-being and general emotional health do not change substantially after a breast cancer diagnosis.In summary, issues related to baseline co-morbidities in frail elderly, the adverse effects of novel chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) or target drugs (biologicals) and compliance in the elderly population should receive more attention in evaluations of QOL in elderly breast cancer patients. Future studies that include QOL measurements should also provide details on the data collection and quality control methodologies used. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.",,0

Patients with instable and painful spinal metastases receive surgery for stabilization followed by fractionated radiotherapy over 2-4 weeks to control the underlying malignant process. Many patients with bone metastases simultaneously present visceral metastases and require urgent systemic therapy. However, due to increased toxicity, concurrent chemotherapy and irradiation is rarely possible. We have therefore established a novel method for intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) during kyphoplasty which enables immediate stability, sterilization of the metastasis and immediate initiation of chemotherapy. Materials/Methods: The kyphoplasty conformed to standard procedure with minor modifications. For intraoperative radiotherapy the INTRABEAM system (Carl Zeiss Surgical, Oberkochen, Germany) was used. After choosing a bipendicular approach specially designed metallic sleeves were inserted to guide the drift tube of the INTRABEAM system. Correct position of the sleeves was verified using biplanar X-rays. Then the applicator (including the drift tube) was guided through the sleeve into the center of the metastasis. There a single dose of 8 Gy in 5 mm distance using 50 kV x-rays was delivered within 2 minutes. After removal of the INTRABEAM system the kyphoplasty balloon was inflated and PMMA cement was injected. The total treatment lasted less than 90 minutes. Results: Since August 2009 14 lesions in 12 patients were treated. There were five males and seven female patients with a median age of 65, 5 years. The primary histological diagnoses included: breast cancer (6), prostate cancer (2), rectum cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (respectively 1). No radiation induced skin reaction or neuropathy was seen. There were only a few procedure-related complications in two patients (asymptomatic extravertebral cement leak, asymptomatic pulmonary cement extravasation). Pain improved in all patients on day one. To date there have been no local failures with a median follow-up of two months (> 6 months in 2 patients). Conclusions: The combination of kyphoplasty and IORT is technically feasible with high patient acceptance. As survival in patients with cancer increases this new treatment method may become a valuable option for patients with spinal metastases providing immediate stability and sterilization of the metastasis.",,0

Patients and Methods: 378 patients were included in the study, 188 patients in group 1 (conventional boost) and 190 patients in group 2 (IOERT boost). Patients were comparable with regard to age, menopausal status, tumor size, histological type, grading and axillary lymph node status. Included were patients with invasive breast cancer pT1 and pT2, N0, N1, N2, M0, and breast conserving surgery with clear margins >3 mm. Excluded were patients with DCIS only, patients with invasive breast cancers larger than pT2, patients after primary systemic therapy and patients with multicentric disease. All patients (group 1 and group 2) received postoperative whole breast irradiation of 51-56.1 Gy. Group 1 received postoperative electron boost irradiation of 12 Gy after whole breast irradiation and group 2 received one intraoperative electron boost of 9 Gy in a single fraction during surgery before whole breast irradiation. Results: The 10-years actuarial rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), true local recurrence (TLR), distant recurrence (DR) and disease free survival (DFS) were 7.1% (95% CI, 3.2-11.0%), 4.8% (95% CI, 1.5-8.0%), 14.2% (95% CI, 9.1-19.4%) and 82.4% respectively in group1 and 2.7% (95% CI, 0.0-5.9%, P =0.062), 0.7% (95% CI, 0.0-2.0%, P = 0.016), 13.6% (95% CI, 5.0-22.2%, P = 0.90) and 84.0% (P= 0.76) respectively in group 2.

Patients and Methods: After breast-conserving surgery, 378 women with invasive breast cancer of tumor sizes T1 and T2 received 51-56.1 Gy of postoperative radiation therapy to the whole breast in 1.7-Gy fractions. 188 of those patients additionally received a postoperative electron boost of 12 Gy in group 1 from January 1996 to October 1998. Consecutively, from October 1998 to March 2001, 190 patients received intraoperative electron-boost radiotherapy of 9 Gy to the tumor bed in group 2. The groups were comparable with regard to age, menopausal status, tumor size, grading, and nodal status. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: During a median follow-up period of 55.3 months in group 1 and 25.8 months in group 2, local recurrences were observed in eight of 188 patients (4.3%) in group 1, and no local recurrence was seen in group 2 (p = 0.082). Distant metastases occurred in 15 of the 188 patients (7.9%) in group 1 and in two of the 190 patients (1.1%) in group 2 (p = 0.09). The 4-year actuarial rates of local recurrence were 4.3% (95% confidence interval, 1.8-8.2%) and 0.0% (95% confidence interval, 0.0-1.9%) and the 4-year actuarial rates of distant metastases were 7.9% (95% confidence interval, 4.5-12.8%) and 1.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.1-3.8%). Conclusion: Immediate IORT boost yielded excellent local control figures in this prospective investigation and appears to be superior to conventional postoperative boost in a short-term follow-up.",,1

Local recurrence rate after breast-conserving surgery varies between 5 and 18%. External boost radiation can partially miss the tumour bed and therefore can result in local failure. Intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT) as a high precision boost can prevent a 'geographical miss'. From October 1998 to December 2000, 156 patients with stage I and stage II breast cancer were operated upon in a dedicated IORT facility. After local excision of the tumour, the tumour bed was temporarily approximated by sutures to bring the tissue in the radiation planning target volume. A single dose of 9 Gy was applied to the 90% reference isodose with energies ranging from 4 to 15 MeV, using round applicator tubes 4-8 cm in diameter. After wound healing, the patients received additional 51-56 Gy EBRT to the whole breast. No acute complications associated with IORT were observed. In 5 patients, a secondary mastectomy had to be performed because of tumour multicentricity in the final pathological report or excessive intraductal component. 2 patients developed rib necroses. In 7 patients, wound healing problems occurred. After a mean follow-up of 18 months, no local recurrences were observed. Cosmesis of the breast was very good and comparable to patients without IORT. Preliminary data suggest that IORT given as a boost after breast-conserving surgery could be a reliable alternative to conventional postoperative fractionated boost radiation by accurate dose delivery and avoiding geographical misses, by enabling smaller treatment volumes and complete skin-sparing and by reducing postoperative radiation time by 7-14 days. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",,0

Many studies suggest that local control plays a crucial role in overall survival. The local recurrence rate is estimated to be 1% per year and varies between 4 and 7% after 5 years and up to 10 to 20% in the long-term follow up. On the basis of low local recurrence rates the concept of whole breast irradiation comes up for discussion, and partial breast irradiation (PBI) is increasingly under consideration. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is referred to as the delivery of a single high dose of irradiation directly to the tumor bed (confined target) during surgery. PBI (limited field radiation therapy, accelerated partial breast irradiation APBI) is the irradiation exclusively confined to a breast volume, the tumor surrounding tissue (tumor bed) either during surgery or after surgery without whole breast irradiation. Various methods and techniques for IORT or PBI are under investigation. The advantage of a very short radiation time or the integration of the complete radiation treatment into the surgical procedure convinces at a first glance. The promising short-term results of those studies must not fail to mention that local recurrence rates could probably increase and furthermore give rise to distant metastases and a reduction in overall survival. The combination of IORT in boost modality and whole breast irradiation has the ability to reduce local recurrence rates. The EBCTCG overview approves that differences in local treatment that substantially affect local recurrence rates would avoid about one breast cancer death over the next 15 years for every four local recurrences avoided, and should reduce 15-year overall mortality.",,0

Aim of this study was to evaluate the IBTR rate in patients who were treated with preoperative chemotherapy followed by breast conserving surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (IOERT). Patients and Methods: 84 patients with clinical stage II or III breast cancer were included in the study. Patients received 3 to 6 cycles of anthracyclin/taxane containing preoperative chemotherapy. All patients had breast conserving surgery with sentinel node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection and received intraoperative radiotherapy with 9 Gy to the 90% reference isodose as an anticipated boost radiation. Whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) was performed after surgery for all patients. Results: Pathologic complete response was achieved in 18/84 (21%) patients. Mean resection volume was 250 ml. After a median follow-up of 30.5 months (range 6 - 77 months) no IBTR could be observed. One patient developed a locoregional recurrence in the axilla and nine patients developed distant disease, five of those died of disease. Three patients developed contralateral breast cancer. 71 patients are alive without evidence of disease. Conclusion: Breast conserving surgery with IOERT in boost modality after preoperative chemotherapy is a reliable tool for the prevention of IBTR. The period between IOERT and WBRT is short as no adjuvant chemotherapy is necessary. Cosmetic outcome is excellent.",,0

The RBE expresses the enhancement of the biological tissue damage in brachytherapy, compared to conventional brachytherapy sources, such as 1921r. Materials: Low-energy x-teys are known to have a higher RBE than higher energy photons such as the gamma rays from 1921r and 60 Co. In this work the initial yield of single and double strand DNA breaks (SSB and DSB) and the RBE was estima ted for 1251brachytherapy seeds and electronic brachytherapy source (EBS) of 50kVp. Monte Carlo models of the sources were used to generate photon and electron spectra in various media (water, breast, prostate, cortical bone and calcifications inside the prostate). The photon spectrum in air lor EBS was validated against spectrometry, for 1251 it was validated against literature. The spectrum of electrons generated during photon interactions (primary electron spectrum) were then used to calculate the frequency of SSB and DSB in various media, with the 'Monte Carlo damage simulation ' MCDS program (Semenenko et ai, 2006). From the SSB and DSB frequencies the RBE in these media was calculated. Results: The results indicate a substantially reduced SSB Zield a n~9J ncreased DSB yield for the low energy photons compared to Co or lr, leading to an enhanced RBE for DSB induction by 4050%, thereby confirming radiobiological experiments. The RBE estimate for the low-energy X-ray EBS was found to be very similar to the low-energy gamma ray brachytherapy isotope 1251.

A slight decrease was found in bone and calcifications with 15 DSB GBP IGy and an RBE of 1.4 due to the presence of Ca or P. Their presence increases the yield of photoelectric effect leading to a higher dose deposition but a reduction in the contribution of the very low energy electrons generated by the Compton effect, which are the most damaging for DNA (see figurel).(Figure Presented) Conclusions: The presence of high Z elements in the tissue is well known to Increase the deposited dose because of the increase of the photoelectric yield but this study shows that, from a microdosimetric point of view, there is a slight reduction in the efficiency of low energy photons in those high Z regions due to the disappearance of the Compton electron.",,0

Koves,2003.0,[Radioguided excision of non-palpable breast lesions with simultaneous sentinel lymph node biopsy],", ","As a result of mammographic screening nonpalpable breast lesions are found with increasing frequency. The surgical management of these lesions presents two main problems: (1) How to localize the lesion pre- and intraoperatively; (2) What should be the extension of the axillary dissection for malignant lesions. This study is aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility of radioguided excision of nonpalpable breast lesions and the possibility of performing simultaneous sentinel lymph node biopsy for malignant lesions. Radioguided breast excisions have been performed in our Department since November 2000. The basis of this method is that radioisotope labelled colloid is injected into the lesion under stereo tactic or sonographic guidance. A gamma-probe is used intraoperatively to locate the lesion and guide its excision. Dual agent guided technique is used for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Radioguided breast excision was performed on 85 patients (93 lesion) till February 2002. The localization and excision were successful in 84 patients (92 lesions) (99%). Multifocal lesions were successfully localized and excised in 7 patients. There were 61 parenchyma lesions (66%) and 31 microcalcifications (34%). Localization was performed under sonographic guidance in 44 patients (52%) and under stereotactic guidance in 40 patients (48%). There were 25 benign (27%) and 67 malignant (73%) lesions. Second surgical procedure (mastectomy) was needed in 4 patients (6.5%) because of histologically incomplete excision. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 50 patients. The biopsy was successful in 45 patients (90%). The sentinel lymph node was histologically positive in 2 patients (4.4%). Radioguided localization with the intraoperative use of a gamma-probe is an easy, rapid and highly accurate technique for removing nonpalpable breast lesions and allows simultaneous sentinel lymph node biopsy for malignant lesions.",hun,0

Secondary breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed secondary malignancy in young women after supradiaphragmal radiation therapy of HD in childhood and adolescence. Longitudinal follow-up data (HD-78-HD90 between 1978 and 1995) analysed by a working group on HD-therapy associated late effects of the Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (GPOH) identified a 24fold increase of breast cancer in women between 25 and 45 y after HD radiotherapy during puberty compared to age-adjusted women of the general population. The median time of breast cancer diagnosis was 20.7 years after HD therapy between the ages of 9 and 16 years. Due to these data a structured breast cancer screening program was established in cooperation with the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC). Two women's decisions on therapeutic strategies after their early breast cancer diagnosis within the screening program illustrate the scope of alternatives: The first patient (39 y, stage pT1b, pN0, HR+, Her2-, G2) underwent BCT and intraoperative radiotherapy. The second patient (39 y, stage pT1c, pN0, HR+, Her2, G2) underwent bilateral (semi-)prophylactic mastectomy with primary heterologous reconstruction. The data and cases demonstrate 1. the necessity to include women after HD radiotherapy during puberty into the structured screening program, 2. the variety of individual therapeutic strategies based on the support of a multidisciplinary team.",,0

METHODS: Thirty-one patients with 32 stage I or II breast carcinomas underwent breast-conserving therapy, which included lumpectomy with negative margins, sentinel node biopsy, or axillary dissection, followed by brachytherapy with the MammoSite applicator. Acute radiation skin complications were graded on the day of radiotherapy completion and at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 12 after radiation treatment. Cosmesis was graded on the Harvard Scale at all follow-ups. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 11 months (range, 4-15 months). Twenty-seven of the 31 patients were treated with the device as the sole method of radiotherapy. No acute toxicities occurred during the 5 days of treatment. Nineteen patients (68%) had no to mild acute skin reactions, and 25% developed bright erythema and patchy moist desquamation. Two patients (7%) developed confluent moist desquamation within the first 4 weeks (grade 3); this healed by week 12. All skin reactions were localized to the area overlying the balloon. Sixteen percent (5 of 32) of all breasts with implants developed infection. Cosmesis was good to excellent in 86% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Most acute skin toxicities were mild. Our infection rate was higher than in prior studies that used interstitial brachytherapy. Cosmesis was good to excellent in most patients.

METHODS: All events reported in the 2-year period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2010 were categorized and analyzed. The 4 main areas of dose delivery were Gamma Knife radiosurgery, therapeutic radiopharmaceutical administration, high-dose-rate brachytherapy, and low-dose-rate brachytherapy. The different types of errors were wrong site, wrong dose, unintended exposure, lost or leaking source, or other. The causes of events were specified as the following: communication errors, equipment malfunction, human error, lack of training, or miscellaneous. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-seven events were found in the 2-year period. This error reporting rate far surpasses previous reports. The greatest number of events reported was for low-dose-rate brachytherapy, and the most common cause of error was human error. Wrong dose was the error that occurred most often, followed by wrong site. CONCLUSIONS: Very simple treatment errors, such as wrong patient, or wrong side of patient treated, are still occurring. Newer, complex deliveries such as high-dose-rate partial breast irradiation and low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy also had a large number of events reported in this sampling.

Results: 75 (20,66%) patients were unsuited for IORT for different reasons: inability to mobilize sufficient breast tissue (37), R1 resection (7), multicentric disease (15) and others like DCIS-only, bifokal disease and tumor location close to the nipple (16). 288 Patients (79,34%). Of these, 24 Patients (8.33%) were referred to a re-excision to reach RO-status, 5 patients (1.74%) underwent secondary mastectomy and another 5 underwent separate axillary dissection . 236 patients had stage pT1-tumors ( 16-pT1a / 70 pT1b / 150 pT1c), 51 patients pT2 and one patient stage pT3. 46 patients showed up with G1-, 174 with G2-, and 68 with G3-Grading. 230 Pat. were classified node- negative ( 3-pNOi+ / 227- pN0), 45 with pN1- ( 34 pN1 / 11 pNmic), 9 with pN2- and 4 with pN3-disease.111 pts. underwent adjuvant chemotherapy (CTX) ,14 pts declined CTX, 7 pts are still in CTX. For patients without CTX (156), WBRT (50.4) started 6 weeks after surgery ( median 47,76 days, range 21-83). 4 Patients refused WBRT, received postoperative radiotherapy in another center. In patients treated with adjuvant CTX , the median delay between IORT and WBRT amounted 168 days 87-233 ).At a median follow-up of 12 months, so far no patient developed in-breast or systemic recurrence. Acute toxicity was assessed 6 weeks after IORT and 2 months after WBRT ( CTC-Criteria), long term morbidity one year after WBRT according to Lent Soma and Taylor-score after two years, respectively.Acute reactions: 1. 6 weeks after IORT : 190 evaluated patients: wound infection 12 ( 6,23%), seroma 23 (12.11%), hematoma 23 (12.11%), pain 5 (5.79%) 2. 4 weeks post WBRT: 157 evaluated pat. with CTC-score 0 in 127 Pat.(80.89%) CTC I in 27 Pat.(17.2%), 3 Pat.(1.91%) CTC II and 0 Pat.

The literature reports several cases of unsuccessful breast augmentation due to implant displacement, a high percentage of capsular contracture and postoperative complications. We report the case of a 47-year-old woman with a small tumour between the inner quadrants of the left breast. She underwent quadrantectomy and sentinel node biopsy and intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) of the target zone. Simultaneously, she received a bilateral augmentation mammaplasty. One year later we observed no evidence of local recurrence, no local fibrosis and radiodistrophy. Cosmetic results are excellent and the patient is very satisfied.

The characteristics of the accelerators heads of the Novac7 and Liac are different compared to conventional electron accelerators. The aim of this work was to investigate the specific characteristics of the Novac7 and Liac electron beams using the Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo code BEAMnrc has been employed to model the head and simulate the electron beams. The Monte Carlo simulation was preliminarily validated by comparing the simulated dose distributions with those measured by means of EBT radiochromic film. Then, the energy spectra, mean energy profiles, fluence profiles, photon contamination, and angular distributions were obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation. The Spencer-Attix water-to-air mass restricted collision stopping power ratios (sw,air) were also calculated. Moreover, the modifications of the percentage depth dose in water (backscatter effect) due to the presence of an attenuator plate composed of a sandwich of a 2 mm aluminum foil and a 4 mm lead foil, commonly used for breast treatments, were evaluated. The calculated sw,air values are in agreement with those tabulated in the IAEA TRS-398 dosimetric code of practice within 0.2% and 0.4% at zref (reference depth in water) for the Novac7 and Liac, respectively. These differences are negligible for practical dosimetry. The attenuator plate is sufficient to completely absorb the electron beam for each energy of the Novac7 and Liac; moreover, the shape of the dose distribution in water strongly changes with the introduction of the attenuator plate. This variation depends on the energy of the beam, and it can give rise to an increase in the maximum dose in the range of 3%-9%.",,0

Postoperatively, the DCIS lesion size determined by imaging was compared with lesion size and surgical margin status obtained from the surgical pathology specimen. Thirty-five patients completed IORT. Median patient age was 57 years (range 42-79 years) and median histologic lesion size was 15.6 mm (2-40 mm). No invasive cancer was identified.

However, questions have been raised about the potential of f IORT to produce breast parenchymal changes that could interfere with mammographic surveillance of cancer recurrence. The purpose of this study was to identify, quantify, and compare the mammographic findings of patients who received IORT and EBRT in a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of women with early stage invasive breast cancer undergoing breast conserving therapy between July 2005 and December 2009. Treatment groups were compared with regard to the 1, 2 and 4-year incidence of 6 post-operative mammographic findings: architectural distortion, skin thickening, skin retraction, calcifications, fat necrosis, and mass density. Blinded review of 90 sets of mammograms of 15 IORT and 16 EBRT patients demonstrated a higher incidence of fat necrosis among IORT recipients at years 1, 2, and 4. However, none of the subjects were judged to have suspicious mammogram findings and fat necrosis did not interfere with mammographic interpretation. © 2012 Ronald Rivera et al.",,0

Thus, restriction of radiation therapy to the tumour bed during surgery might be adequate for selected patients The Intrabeam (Carl Zeiss) (IB) is an electronic brachytherapy device that can be used to deliver lowenergy X-rays (50 kV) to a lumpectomy cavity at the time of lumpectomy for breast cancer. The randomized phase III TARGiT trial demonstrated similar recurrence rates to whole breast irradiation (WBI) and a lower overall toxicity profile on short-term follow-up. Aim. There is not reported experience with IB for breast cancer in Spain. We present the first and limited experience in this setting evaluating prospects of use of IB in Spain: (1) has been described an increased clinically relevant RBE (mean RBE values of 50-kV X-rays from Intrabeam were 1.26-1.42). Total dose given 20Gy at surface applicator. (2) For selected patients, a single dose of radiotherapy delivered at the time of surgery by use of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy should be considered as an alternative to external beam radiotherapy delivered over severalweeks. (3) Lumpectomy and Targit boost combined with external beam radiotherapy results in very low local recurrence rate due to accurate localization and the immediacy of the treatment. Targit boost might be superior to an external beam boost in its efficacy. (4) Cost reduction both in economical, personal and quality of life compared with WBI. (5) Other tumour locations are also suitable for this treatment. Conclusion. While a variety of APBI techniques are currently available for clinical use, our early experience with IORT showsit iswell tolerated with low morbidity. Delivery of IORT adds moderate operative time (mean 30 min) and require creating subcutaneous tissue flaps.",,0

This paper focuses on the evaluation of the EBT2 film response in the green and red colour channels for IORT quality assurance (QA). Methods: The calibration of the EBT2 films was done in two ranges; 0-8Gy for machine QA by red channel and 8-24Gy for patient-specific QA by green channel analysis. Irradiation of calibration films and relative dosimetries were performed in a water phantom. To evaluate the accuracy of the film response in relative dosimetry, gamma analysis was used to compare the results of the Monte Carlo simulation and ionometric dosimetry. Ten patients with early stage breast cancer were selected for in-vivo dosimetry using the green channel of the EBT2 film. Results: The calibration curves were obtained by linear fitting of the green channel and a third-order polynomial function in the red channel (R2. =. 0.99). The total dose uncertainty was up to 4.2% and 4.7% for the red and green channels, respectively. There was a good agreement between the relative dosimetries of films by the red channel, Monte Carlo simulations and ionometric values. The mean dose difference of the in-vivo dosimetry by green channel of this film and the expected values was about 1.98%+/-0.75. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that EBT2 film can be considered as an appropriate tool for machine and patient-specific QA in IORT.

In these settings, where many women present with advanced disease at an age when they are often the primary caregiver for their families, the lack of access to radiotherapy is particularly devastating. Until recently, this disparity has been largely neglected in the medical literature and it had been difficult to convince governments, industry, and policymakers of the importance of investing in radiotherapy, as well as broader cancer control strategies, in low-resource settings. The Lancet Radiotherapy Commission report published in 2015 challenged many assumptions about the affordability of radiotherapy treatment. Data from the Commission is presented here to support radiotherapy investment for breast cancer and discuss how the morbidity and premature mortality among adult women caused by breast cancer has a huge detrimental effect on both the health sector and the economy.

The aim of this study was to compare localised and generalised findings at follow-up mammography and the need for interventions such as ultrasound and biopsy between women in the two treatment arms from a single recruiting centre. Methods We have compared the 61 women who received IORT alone with the 63 women who received EB alone. All mammograms were reviewed by radiologists blinded to the treatment received. The focal soft tissue appearance was classified. The presence of generalised skin thickening and increased density was recorded. The performance of ultrasound and/or biopsy was recorded. Results The number of follow-up mammograms and length of followup was similar in both groups (2.46 IORT vs. 2.09 EB and 3.27 years IORT vs. 3.0 years EB). There was no difference in the mammographic appearance of the postoperative site between the two groups. However, generalised skin thickening and increase in density were more common in the EB group compared with the IORT group (20 of 63 (37%) vs. 10 of 61 (16%), P = 0.04 and 20 of 63 (37%) vs. 5 of 61 (8%), P = 0.001, respectively).

Journal Article,E. Rosenblatt,2012.0,The role of industry in developing cost-effective brachytherapy,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed14&AN=70837055","Brachytherapy has become increasingly popular and highly tied to technological development. The increasing popularity of brachytherapy is a direct consequence of its effectiveness in the cure or palliation of various forms of cancer. But also, the increasing dependence of brachytherapy on complex technology, determines a corresponding increase in costs. Cost-effectiveness analyses relate the additional cost to its incremental impact on any clinically relevant measure of benefit. Because one of the primary uses of economic analysis is to allocate limited resources among diverse interventions, benefit has to be measured in units that are universally applicable to all interventions. Years-of-life-saved"" is the most commonly used measure. When calculating ""cost-effectiveness"" then, only cost and survival must be measured. A treatment's cost-effectiveness ratio is calculated by dividing its incremental cost by its incremental impact on survival as compared to the most reasonable alternative treatment. The result of this rate is then expressed in dollars per years-of-life-saved. Interventions costing less than an additional U$ 50.000 per year-oflife-saved are considered ""cost-effective"". The industry has traditionally had a key role in the development of brachytherapy as we know it today. The brachytherapy industry now mostly gravitates around two main lines of production; [1] high doserate (HDR) remote afterloaders and accessories, and [2] prostate brachytherapy systems. Demand by patients and physicians for innovations to help cancer patients, drives investment in biotechnologies given the potential profits. From the industry perspective, pricing of new cancer innovations is influenced by development costs (including risk at each stage of development) production costs, potential market size, pricing of comparables, and ultimately the novelty and value of the new product in the marketplace. Innovation in the brachytherapy field has to pay close attention to a number of issues such as the international basic safety standards as well as standards of safety determined by the ICRP, source characterization protocols, IEC compliance and compliance with the requirements of specific national or regional regulatory bodies such as the FDA in the US and the EURATOM Directives in the EU. The introduction of HDR brachytherapy allowed treatments to be given in minutes rather than days, replace hospital admissions by ambulatory treatments and eliminate the need for spinal or general anaesthesia, in other words; more cost-effective brachytherapy. Economic analysis have shown that in departments that treat more than 300 new cases of cervical cancer per year, the use of HDR brachytherapy is clearly cost-effective as compared with LDR. The equivalence of HDR vs. LDR in terms of clinical outcomes and toxicities has already been established in level-I evidence studies carried out in developed as well as developing countries. The miniaturisation of Cobalt-60 sources, making them the same size of previously used Ir-192 sources, was a clear and significant step towards a more cost-effective brachytherapy. Other strategies to be discussed are accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and electronic brachytherapy. One possible approach that has been promoted by the IAEA through the AGaRT (""Advisory Group for increasing access to Radiotherapy Technology"") process is encouraging the manufacturers to develop packages of equipment fully compatible and which are sold at accessible prices. A typical package may include for example: the afterloader, a number of sources, a BT treatment planning system with software, connectors and applicators, an imaging device, a service maintenance contract and training. Manufacturers have responded positively to this challenge, and the process moves forward. To make brachytherapy more cost-effective then, the industry must come up with either treatments strategies or techniques that are more effective, resource-sparing or both, while at the same time keeping the high standards of safety that are the norm today.""",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis of 136 breasts of 134 patients, who received breast-conserving oncoplastic surgery for low-risk breast cancer between 2002 and 2010 in the Universities of Vienna and Luebeck followed by adjuvant APBI applying total doses of pulse dose rate of 50.4 Gy or high-dose rate (HDR) of 32 Gy over 4 days. Target volume definition was performed by the use of surgical-free margin data, related to intraoperatively fixed clip positions, pre- and postoperative imaging, and palpation. RESULTS: At the time of data acquisition, 131 of 134 patients were alive. The median follow-up time was 39 months (range, 4-106 months). After high-dose rate treatment, 3 of 89 patients showed systemic progress after a mean follow-up of 47 months (range, 19-75 months) and 2 patients had a different quadrant in-breast tumor after 27 and 35 months. One patient died 7 months after treatment of unknown causes. After pulse dose rate treatment, 1 of 45 patients had a local recurrence after 42 months and 1 patient died because of another cause after 13 months. We observed mild fibrosis in 27 breasts, telangiectasia in 6, hyperpigmentation in 14 cases, and keloid formation in 1. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest the feasibility of multicatheter APBI after oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery in selected low-risk breast cancer patients; however, special attention to target volume definition is needed. Further prospective investigations with long follow-up are needed to define the real value of the procedure.",eng,0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Preoperative RCT in 315 and adjuvant RCT in 329 cases consisted in 50 Gy (5 x 2 Gy/week) to the breast and the supra-/infraclavicular lymph nodes. 101 neoadjuvant patients received - in case of breast conservation - a 10-Gy interstitial boost with (192)Ir afterloading before and 214 neoadjuvant patients a preoperative electron boost after external-beam radiotherapy. In the neoadjuvant RCT group, chemotherapy was applied prior to radiotherapy in 192 patients, and simultaneously in 113; ten had no chemotherapy. In the adjuvant RCT group, chemotherapy was applied to 44 patients before surgery and to 166 after surgery; 119 had no chemotherapy. RESULTS: Breast conservation became possible in 50.8% after neoadjuvant RCT for LABC with a pCR rate at surgery of 29.2%. A complete nodal remission (pN0) after RCT was observed in 56% (89/159) of the cN+ (clinically node-positive) neoadjuvant patients. There were trends in favor of preoperative RCT for RFS and OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.85; p = 0.09 for RFS; HR = 0.8130; p = 0.1037 for OS). For patients with cT2 tumors the RFS and OS were statistically significantly better (HR = 0.5090; p = 0.0130 for RFS; HR = 0.4390; p = 0.0026 for OS) after neoadjuvant compared to adjuvant RCT.

Frequent local recurrences are reported, which are most likely due to insufficient operative technique. We present the fourth case of cervical ipsilateral metastatic microcystic adnexal carcinoma in an otherwise healthy woman. The patient presented with a previously diagnosed but not completely resected microcystic adnexal carcinoma in the area of the right posterior scalp and two palpable ipsilateral lymph nodes. The tumor was resected using intraoperative snap frozen histological evaluation of the resection borders. In the same procedure two lymph nodes were resected from the right neck. The lymph nodes were histologically assessed and showed infiltration by small strains of tumor cells. After exclusion of a second primary tumor, e.g., mammary carcinoma, as the cause for cervical lymph node metastases, we performed a modified radical neck dissection with resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the accessory nerve, which was histologically proven to be perineurally infiltrated by tumor cells. In this second procedure the histological evaluation of the specimen showed no sign of remaining tumor infiltration. After exclusion of distant metastasis the patient was irradiated with 60 Gy. The patient is well 1 year after the initial treatment without signs of recurrence.",eng,0

Radical resection is possible in only 15%-20% of patients, and only 3%-4% of all patients presenting with this condition achieve long-term control and cure. Various strategies in the form of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment have been employed over the years to improve outcome, with limited success. Systemic chemotherapy remains the gold standard in the metastatic setting in good performance status patients, and adjuvant chemotherapy after resection of localized and locally advanced cancer has been found to improve outcome. The role of radiotherapy, however, remains controversial and is an area that merits further investigation in well-conducted multicenter trials at various stages of the disease in combination with systemic agents and exploiting recent advances in the delivery of radiotherapy. In this article, we review the published literature on the use of chemoradiation as a modality in various stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and highlight areas that future trials in this field should target for a way forward in this malignancy. ©AlphaMed Press.",,0

The two therapeutic modalities were compared in terms of the following parameters; i.e. cosmesis, optimization of tumor bed boost, local control, toxicity, and DFS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The EBRT dose used was 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks time. Target delineation of boost treatment was done by CT scan or by high resolution USG. EBRT will be immediately followed by local boost at the primary tumor bearing site of breast with 8 to12 MeV electron beam to a dose of 15 Gy in 6 fractions (Arm A) or with HDR 192Ir interstitial brachytherapy to a dose of 15 Gy in 3 fractions at 6 hours apart (Arm B). RESULTS: The excellent cosmesis achieved with electron beam therapy in Arm A was found to be statistically significant (P = 0.025). Local relapse was absent in both the arms. One distant metastasis occurred in Arm A within 10 months of initiation of treatment and one distant metastasis in Arm B came out within 3 months of starting of therapy. CONCLUSION: The study has shown good cosmetic result with electron boost and 100% local control with both the technique.

The scintigraphic study of the breast and regional metastatic areas by means of the radionuclide 99mTc (MIBI) technitrile was made on a Millennium GE tomographic gamma chamber. The radiotracer 550 (MBq) dissolved in 10-20 ml of saline solution was intravenously injected into the arm cubital vein contralaterally to the lesion. Following 20 minutes of injection of the agent, plain scintigraphy was carried out in three standard projections: frontal and two oblique ones. The scintigraphy was performed using a high-resolution collimator recording a 128 x 128 matrix image. The detector was maximally approximated to the organ being examined. A plain scintigraphic scan was recorded on each side for 10 minutes. By the degree of axillary lymph nodal involvement, the patients were divided into 3 groups in accordance with the international TNM classification: N0 (n = 55), N1 (n = 13), N2 (n = 4). Among 72 patients, axillary lymph nodes could be detected in 6, in 2 of them changes were not diagnosed by X-ray and ultrasound studies. The final pathomorphological study of intraoperative materials revealed axillary lymph nodal metastatic involvement in 17 patients. A micrometastasis in one lymph node was found in 1 patient. None of the radionuclide studies showed tumor spread in 5 cases. The sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the technique were 35.3, 100, and 84.7%, respectively. Thus, a combination of the high cost of the procedure, its radiation load on a patient, and its low sensitivity make the use of plain scintigraphy of axillary regions inexpedient in the complex of studies of the extent of breast cancer in the present development of technology.",rus,0

Follow-up-findings of 54 patients were retrospectively evaluated and compared to a control group of 48 patients, treated with BCS and whole-breast radiotherapy. After IORT patients had a higher incidence of fat necroses manifesting as oil cysts in the late follow-up mammograms (n = 31 vs n = 8); furthermore, oil cysts were larger in the IORT group (median 4.5 vs 1.4 cm<sup>2</sup>). In 25 IORT patients the oil cysts arose from partially organized hematomas/seromas, which in this group were generally more frequent (n = 38 vs n = 9) and larger (median 3.6 vs 1.8 cm<sup>2</sup>). After IORT a decreasing incidence of hematomas/seromas was reciprocal to an increasing incidence of oil cysts, and the size of both entities correlated with each other. Liquid lesions with polypoid inner wall thickening on ultrasound, attributed to organized hematomas/seromas or fat necroses, appear more frequently after IORT (n = 15 vs n = 1). In conclusion, IORT is associated with a high incidence of large oil cysts, which arise from likewise large partially organized wound cavities.

If such a setup error occurs, the treatment zone could receive a nonuniform dose delivery, and a considerable part of the electron beam could hit - and irradiate - the patient's healthy tissue. However misalignment and tilt angle of the shielding disc can be evaluated, but it is not possible to measure the corresponding in vivo dose distribution. This led us to develop a simulation using the Geant4 Monte Carlo toolkit to study the effects of disc configuration on dose distribution. Some parameters were investigated: the shielding factor (SF), the radiation back scattering factor (BSF), the volume-dose histogram in the treatment zone, and the maximum leakage dose (MLD) in normal tissue. A lateral shift of the disc (in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis) causes a decrease in SF (from 4% for a misalignment of 5 mm to 40% for a misalignment of 40 mm), but no relevant dose variations were found for a tilt angle until 10degree. In the same uncorrected disc positions, the BSF shows no significant change. MLD rises to 3.45 Gy for a 14 mm misalignment and 4.60 Gy for 30degree tilt angle when the prescribed dose is 21 Gy. The simulation results are compared with the experimental ones, and allow an a posteriori estimation of the dose distribution in the breast target and underlying healthy tissue. This information could help the surgical team choose a more correct clinical setup, and assist in quantifying the degree of success or failure of an IOERT breast treatment.",,0

The treatment depends on the nature of the tumor and on the specific patient anatomical-pathological condition. The urgent demand by radiotherapy-medical community to improve treatment procedures and clinical protocols, in particular to optimize the dose distribution and patient radio protection, can besatisfied by the development of some dedicated tool. In this perspective, our project is to integrate the DICOM images in a validated GEANT4 application for the simulation of a IORT linac. Materials and Methods: The Geant4 toolkit allows the simulation of the passage and interaction of particles with the matter. The toolkit is based on Monte Carlo methods and, today, it is widely adopted by the Medical Physics community for research purposes. Our Geant4 application converts a CT DICOM file to a simple ASCII file, and the Hounsfield numbers in the corresponding densities and materials. In this way it is able to construct a physical voxellized DICOM volume employed in the Geant4 environment. The rotation and translation of the DICOM phantom and linac beam-collimator system were implemented, to emulate the clinical setups. The calibration curve to convert Hounsfield numbers to physical densities was obtained by the scans of a CIRS (model 062) Electron Density Phantom from a CT machine. In the final test, a female trunk 50 CT DICOM slices (50x50x13 cm<sup>3</sup> and 512x512x50 pixels) were uploaded and the linac collimation system was positioned to simulate a typical breast-IOERT treatment. Results: The simulate dose distribution on the original CT DICOM images was superimposed and visualized using the volume viewer developed for the Geant4 medical simulations. Working configuration was obtained rescaling to 256x256x50 the original CT images to reduce the voxel volume to 1.9x1.9x2.5 mm<sup>3</sup>. The figure, from left to right, shows: the female trunk 50 DICOM 3D image, the corresponding voxellized Geant4 phantom, and the two 3D dose distributions. Conclusions: Many other tests have to be performed. Particular attention will be dedicated to the implementation of a user-friendly interface, and to offer, to the user, a complete toolkit that can meet the needs, from the choice of the clinical setup to the setting of the dose visualization parameters.

The intrasurgical radiation control of the surgical piece is indispensable to evaluate the margins of the mammary cancer. OBJECTIVE: to determine the effectiveness of the intrasurgical radiation control of the surgical piece in nonconcrete mammary injuries to diminish the surgical reinterventions to extend margins. PATIENTS AND METHOD: women with nonconcrete mammary injuries to those who biopsy by split became, previous marking and intraoperating radiation control of the surgical piece to value margins (suitable margin the same or major of 10 mm, smaller inadequate margin of 10 mm).

This finding has led to increasing popularity of single-quadrant brachytherapy. ASTRO has issued guidelines dividing breast conservation patients into 3 subgroups regarding their appropriateness for partial breast irradiation: suitable, cautionary, and unsuitable. We analyzed a group of IORT patients by ASTRO guidelines and histology. Methods A prospective, IRB-approved, clinical trial of IORT using the Xoft Axxent System was designed. Inclusion requirements were invasive carcinoma (ductal or lobular) or DCIS, extent 30 mm or less with negative lymph nodes and final margin width at least 2 mm. Patients who failed 1 or more criteria were advised to undergo additional whole-breast external beam radiation therapy and IORT became the boost dose. All patients had preoperative digital mammography, contrast-enhanced MRI, and ultrasonography of the involved breast and axilla. Results From April 2010 through September 2013, 213 patients were enrolled (216 breasts). Sixty-eight of 216 (31.5%) breasts failed 1 or more pathologic criteria: 20 (9.3%) patients failed due to tumor size, 28 patients had positive nodes (13%), and 35 patients (17%) had margin widths less than 2 mm. One hundred forty-eight breasts (68.5%) were successfully treated and required no additional whole-breast radiotherapy or re-excision. Thirty-three patients underwent whole-breast radiation therapy in addition to IORT; 6 patients chose mastectomy rather than reexcision. There have been no recurrences (0%) after 24 months of median follow-up. Protocol failures are analyzed by ASTRO Brachytherapy Guidelines and by histology in the table. Conclusion There were no protocol failures among 61 ASTRO suitable patients. As expected, 81% of ASTRO unsuitable patients failed 1 or more criteria. Four of 5 patients with invasive lobular carcinoma also failed 1 or more criteria. Preoperative imaging with digital mammography, ultrasonography, and contrast-enhanced MRI was accurate 69% of the time in selecting patients who met our criteria for IORT. When selecting patients based on tumor size alone, imaging was accurate 91% of the time. IORT is particularly attractive for older patients, patients living in rural communities with poor access to radiation treatment centers, and those with busy lifestyles who find it difficult to attend daily treatments for 6 to 7 weeks. As more practices incorporate IORT, the steps in developing institutional protocols, incorporation of society guidelines, and analysis of outcomes become increasingly important.

Methods: Fifty-two women with early-stage breast cancer were treated with breast-conserving therapy and IORT between October 2002 and January 2006. The first 18 women received a radiation dose of 20 Gy. The protocol was then amended and the remaining 34 women were treated with 18 Gy. Each patient was evaluated after surgery, and at 3, 6 and 12 months; complications, toxicity and cosmetic outcomes were recorded by the breast surgeon. Results: Women treated with 18 Gy appeared to have a more favourable cosmetic outcome compared with the earlier treatment group. At last follow-up, none of the women treated on the protocol had a breast recurrence. Conclusion: Experience suggests that this IORT technique is feasible, although further follow-up is necessary to assess its therapeutic value.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiation surface dose was measured on 67 consecutive patients with Stage T1-T2N0M0 breast cancer implanted with the MammoSite balloon. Thermoluminescent dosimeters and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors were used to measure surface dose directly over the balloon, contralateral breast, thyroid, axilla, and inframammary fold. The dose homogeneity was retrospectively studied from the treatment plans in 25 patients. RESULTS: The mean maximum skin dose was 267 cGy, with a range of 56-488 cGy per fraction, 4 cGy (+/-2 cGy) to the contralateral breast, 8 cGy (+/-4 cGy) to the thyroid, 47 cGy to the ipsilateral axilla (+/-33 cGy), and 52 cGy (+/-47 cGy) to the ipsilateral inframmammary fold. The mean dose gradients were 127%, 110%, 99%, 96%, and 89% for inflated volumes of 35, 40, 50, 60, and 70 mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All patients completed therapy with no or minimal skin reaction with radiation doses comparable to or better to external beam radiation. Considering the dose homogeneity, the larger inflated volume allows for better homogeneity of dose distribution, minimizes the volume of contiguous tissue that receives relatively high doses, and may reduce the risk of fat necrosis.",eng,0

Aim: Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is now an acceptable option for low risk early stage breast cancers, allowing patients not to undergo a full course of external radiotherapy. It is not clear, however, whether IORT, providing radiations very close to the chest wall, may produce heart damage. In this study we tried to evaluate if acute or chronic heart damage in early stage breast cancer patients treated with breast conservative surgery (BCS) and IORT, can be assessed by ultra-sensitive cardiac Troponine I (TnI) levels or N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), respectively. Materials and methods: We enrolled 43 patients who received IORT for breast cancer, as part of a TARGIT-A trial. Twenty-two patients had left and 21 right breast cancer. TnI levels were measured immediately before surgery, and six hours after the end of IORT; both TnI and NT-proBNP levels were measured after 12 months. For the patients with left breast cancer, a little tungsten sheet was placed under the major pectoralis muscle, on the chest projection of the X-ray source, in order to protect the heart. Results: None of the patients showed altered serum levels of TnI before surgery, or after IORT procedure and NT-proBNP during foUow-up. No difference in TnI and NT-proBNP values was noticed between right-sided and left-sided breast cancers treated with BCS and IORT. Conclusions: IORT for early stage breast cancer treatment does not increase TnI and NT-proBNP levels, suggesting that the procedure does not determine acute or chronic heart damage.

Results from the BCT trials suggest that the risk for ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence resides within close proximity to the original tumor site. This leads investigators to consider the role of an accelerated and more tumor bed-focused course of radiotherapy. Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) involves treating a limited volume of breast tissue, with dose of irradiation per fraction increased and the treatment time course decreased. Four currently available methods of APBI are interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external-beam radiotherapy. Patient selection is critical. This review article presents some preliminary clinical observations and limitations that suggest a potential role for APBI as a more user-friendly mode for delivering radiotherapy after lumpectomy for early breast cancer. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,0

Second primary tumours are a major concern for long-term survivors, and breast cancer (BC) is the most common solid tumour among women treated for HD. Materials and methods: Fifty-three women treated for primary BC with previous history of malignant lymphoma were identified in our institution, 35 with HD (66%), 18 (34%) with NHL. A comparison group was randomly selected from our database matching for each patient with previous lymphoma, two patients with primary BC (rate 1:2) for age, stage (pathological tumour size [pT] status and nodal status), year of diagnosis, and estrogen and progesterone status (positive versus negative). The primary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: The two groups of patients were compared for biological features: histopathological diagnosis, grading, lymphatic invasion, c-erbB2 overexpression, and Ki-67. Considering these variables, no significant differences were observed between the two groups with the exception of Ki-67, which was found higher in those with previous HD or NHL (65% versus 49%, respectively, P = 0.0526, borderline significant). Comparing the two groups for treatment approach, no differences were found for surgical and medical therapy (endocrine therapy and chemotherapy). However, regarding patients with node-positive disease (14 versus 35 patients), five patients in the lymphoma group (36%), compared with 24 (69%) in the matched group received anthracycline-based therapy (P = 0.0345). As expected, radiotherapy was used very differently in the two groups, with 36% of patients in the study group undergoing intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons versus 10% in the control group (P = 0.0001). Five-year DFS was 54.5% for the study cohort compared with 91% for controls (P < 0.0001). Five-year OS percentages were also statistically different (86.6% and 98.6%, respectively, P = 0.031). Conclusions: Previous history of malignant lymphoma is a negative prognostic factor for women diagnosed subsequently with BC. Some undertreatment of women with the latter might be hypothesised as the reason for the worse outcome.

Four different techniques have been described in randomized trials (follow-up > 4 years): intraoperative-radiotherapy (IORT), delivered at the time of tumorectomy; low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR), delivered in 3 days; external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR), both delivered in 5 days. For comparison, WBI is delivered in seven weeks. The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of the 4 different technical approaches to PBI, for the treatment of selected favourable early stage breast cancer patients, using current cost estimations within the Spanish Public Health System. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was performed using efficacy data from previous prospective trials, calculated in years without mastectomy (YWM). Direct costs were estimated based on charges applied by Madrid,s Autonomous Community, and were expressed in Euros (). For each modality of PBI, local recurrence rates where individualized, and charges weighted for the frequency of its occurrence. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results. RESULTS: A total cost of 5488.25 was estimated for EBRT, 6595.87 for LDR, 7454.10 for HDR, and 8895,71 for IORT. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing IORT to EBRT was 17209.41 /YWM. All brachytherapy techniques (LDR and HDR) were dominated. Sensitivity analysis showed that ICER depends mainly on recurrence level after EBRT, but also on IORT costs. CONCLUSIONS: In a Spanish Public Health Care scenario, IORT shows a reasonable a cost-effectiveness ratio for patients with early stage breast cancer and, due to its intrasurgical administration (same hospital admission required for surgery), should be considered a compelling alternative, in particular for patients with complex transportation demands to access radiotherapy facilities.",,0

Recent introduction of radiance simulation and planning system offers a new tool for the radiation oncologist (RO), allowing treatment simulation in several steps: segmentation, applicator positioning using CT and 3D rendering and parameter selection (applicator diameter, bevel angle and electron beam energy) by optimizing the Dose Volume Histograms (DVHs) on the regions. Recently, new features have been included: a pencil beam calculation algorithm is available, and bolus or protections can be drawn and their electronic density selected, modifying the calculated dose. Experienced users have tested these new possibilities reporting a better pre-planning of the procedure. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the current version of the tool, including these new planning advances, in clinical cases by ROs that have not participated in radiance development till now. Materials: 5 cases, with a CT previous to IEORT, were used for the evaluation. They included the following cancer locations: breast, rectal, ovary relapse, pancreas, and Ewing sarcoma. All were simulated by different ROs from three hospitals: the specialist with longest experience on IOERT procedures was used as a reference. The other physicians had no experience on the use of radiance. Clinical history of the patient was provided with every case. Each evaluator segmented the regions of interest, placed the applicator and selected the treatment parameters in order to optimize the dose coverage on the target volume. Accordance between users was evaluated for the following aspects: segmentation regions, treatment parameters, applicator position and use of bolus and protections. Results: High agreement was found in the simplest cases: breast and rectal cancer: All ORs performed similar tumor and high risk areas segmentation, and applicator parameters were equivalent in both cases. However, the remaining locations showed some discordance in the results: different surgical access, bolus, high risk area definition and applicator location were found among the users. (Figure presented) Conclusions: The results show that although the inclusion of new features allows better planning of the IOERT procedure, this does not imply coincidence between users if they do not have previous experience with the system. It is still necessary to define common clinical protocols for the preplanning process with this new tool, in order to improve the agreement between clinical users.",,0

The tool facilitates applicator positioning on a preoperative available CT, displaying Dose Volume Histograms (DVHs) calculated on pre-segmented regions of interest. An implementation of Pencil Beam (PB) algorithm for dose modelling has been included in RADIANCE, improving the simulator capabilities and turning the system into a real treatment planning tool. The purpose of this work is to present the initial results when PB is used to calculate electron dose on a real patient. Materials: The RADIANCE system and the PB implementation have been developed by GMV (Madrid, Spain) and Ticas Radiofcas (Zaragoza, Spain) in collaboration with three hospitals (Hospital General Unversitario Gregorio Mara Clca La Luz and Hospital Provincial de Castell The PB algorithm calculates the dose distribution depending on the treatment parameters (applicator dia meter, bevel and gantry angles and treatment energy) and the Hounsfield Units from the CT. Geometrical or free-hand regions can be included, with their corresponding electronic densities, in order to simulate bolus effect or protections used during the radiation process, and the corresponding modifications of the treatment beam. Breast cancer was selected as the initial case model, since it presents several remarkable features: partial breast irradiation is one of the main applications of IOERT, the anatomy is minimally distorted during treatment compared to the previous CT scan and the area includes several interfaces (air in lung, fat tissue in the breast and bone in the ribs). It is expected that PB calculations will correctly identify beam interaction with those regions. Several planning options were tested modifying all the described treatment parameters. Results: Our results show that isodose curves modify as expected in all interfaces with air, fat tissue and bones. Dose distribution is more heterogeneous when estimated using PB than when approximated form water measures, particularly on the applicator edges. The useful treatment volume is slightly smaller with PB, what is expected since electron interaction with the tissue is being estimated. Evaluation of protections shows that they are effective stopping the radiation. Bolus behaviour according to PB is consistent, given that dose in tumour bed surface is increased when radiation beam interacts first with the bolus. For the kind of treatment that has been studied (breast), energies commonly used (< 6 MeV) do not deposit significant dose on lung and ribs. Conclusions: PB dose modelling has identified several aspects of IO ERT treatment that cannot be evaluated with conventional water phantom measures. RADIANCE IOERT simulation and planning system moves one step forward to a more precise dose estimation by the inclusion of this algorithm. The use of PB allows quantifying and predicting the influence of several parameters in this IOERT breast model. We expect to validate these results on other locations.",,0

Observations that 80-90% of breast recurrences after breast conservative surgery and WBI occur in the tumor bed questions the need for protracted elective WBI, and provides the rationale for accelerated-partial-breast irradiation (APBI) of small cancers without adverse features predisposing to multicentric recurrence. APBI can be given over a week with various external beam, intraoperative or brachytherapy (interstitial or MammoSite) techniques. Since the approval of MammoSite by the US FDA in May 2002, a surge of interest has been evident, with 4,000 cases treated using this technique in the past 2 years. Several phase II APBI brachytherapy studies show that 4 to 7-year breast control rates (95%), survival and cosmetic outcome obtained from more than 600 appropriately selected women are comparable to matched or historic controls receiving WBI. The 2 to 3-year interim results of two ongoing randomized trials do not show any early detriment with APBI. If mature results of randomized trials confirm equivalence of APBI to conventional WBI in selected women, it would mark a paradigm shift and a major advance in treatment. This would allow many more women to opt for breast conservation, resolve the dilemmas regarding chemotherapy and radiotherapy sequencing and perhaps would be more cost effective.",,0

Deore,1993.0,Therapeutic factors influencing the cosmetic outcome and late complications in the conservative management of early breast cancer,", ","PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of clinical and physical parameters on the cosmetic result and complications, in cancer breast treated with conservative surgery and definitive irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 1980 and December 1990, 289 patients were treated with lumpectomy and/or axillary dissection, radical irradiation with or without adjuvant therapy. The radiation therapy technique consisted of external beam therapy followed by an Ir-192 implant or electron beam boost. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to evaluate the correlation between multiple factors affecting the cosmetic outcome and the complications. RESULTS: Of 289 patients, cosmesis was evaluable in 285 and recorded as excellent to good in 226 (79%), fair in 35 (12%), and poor in 24 (9%). On multivariate analysis of these results, a high dose per fraction (p = .0018), and use of electrons as boost to the tumor bed (p = .001) were found to be significant. When patients boosted with electrons were excluded, a high boost dose (p = .0433) was also found significant. Fifteen (5%) patients developed severe late radiation sequelae and 14 (5%) moderate or severe arm edema. On multivariate analysis only dose per fraction of 2.5 Gy (p < .0001) and higher boost doses (p = .017) were significant. CONCLUSION: In 289 patients of early breast cancer treated with conservative surgery and radical irradiation, multivariate analysis suggests that higher dose per fraction with teletherapy and higher brachytherapy boost dose adversely affect cosmesis and contribute to the late complications.",eng,0

Haemorrhages may occur and can affect the dose distribution, leading to an incorrect target irradiation. The TachoSil (TS) surgical patch, when activated, creates a fibrin clot at the surgical site to achieve haemostasis. The aim of this work was to determine the effect of TS on the dose distribution, and ascertain whether it could be used in combination with IOERT. This characterization was extended to include high dose rate (HDR) intraoperative brachytherapy, which is sometimes used at other institutions instead of IOERT. METHODS: CT images of the TS patch were acquired for initial characterization. Dosimetric measurements were performed in a water tank phantom, using a conventional LINAC with a hard-docking system of cylindrical applicators. Percentage Depth Dose (PDD) curves were obtained, and measurements made at the depth of dose maximum for the three clinically used electron energies (6, 9 and 12MeV), first without any attenuator and then with the activated patch of TS completely covering the tip of the IOERT applicator. For HDR brachytherapy, a measurement setup was improvised using a solid water phantom and a Farmer ionization chamber. RESULTS: Our measurements show that the attenuation of a TachoSil patch is negligible, both for high energy electron beams (6 to 12MeV), and for a HDR (192)Ir brachytherapy source. Our results cannot be extrapolated to lower beam energies such as 50 kVp X-rays, which are sometimes used for breast IORT. CONCLUSION: The TachoSil surgical patch can be used in IORT procedures using 6MeV electron energies or higher, or HDR (192)Ir brachytherapy.",eng,0

Since the majority of local recurrences in selected patients occur close to the former tumor bed, the question arises whether a sole tumor bed irradiation might be a therapeutic alternative to total breast irradiation. Methods: A systematic review of relevant literature concerning partial breast irradiation (PBI) up to November 2004 was undertaken. Studies of any design were included for comparison and discussion. Results: Nine unique brachytherapy studies using the multicatheter technique, one the balloon technique (MammoSiteTM), and eight particular intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) trials were located of which only one was a randomized trial. Only minor postoperative complications were reported. Preliminary results are similar in terms of local tumor control, disease-free and overall survival. However, the current evidence base of IORT studies is poor. Conclusion: Despite controversies regarding PBI after breast-conserving surgery, results of phase I-II trials suggest that sole tumor bed irradiation might be an appropriate therapeutic alternative for selected breast cancer patients. However, more experience and data from ongoing phase III trials are required to define these new methods to be an appropriate treatment option. Therefore, total breast irradiation still remains the standard irradiation modality even in the treatment of early breast cancer, and PBI should be considered investigational.",,0

Breast-conserving surgery followed by whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) has become the standard treatment for the majority of patients with early breast cancer. Whereas the indications for systemic adjuvant treatment have continuously expanded, there is a tendency to restrict postoperative radiotherapy to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) instead of WBRT. METHODS. The different techniques of APBI are described and their respective advantages or potential drawbacks outlined. Moreover, the results described in the literature are briefly reviewed as a basis for the consensus statements and recommendations of the German Society of Radiation Oncology, the German Society of Senology and the Working Group for Gynecological Oncology of the German Cancer Society. RESULTS. The methods mainly used for APBI are: interstitial radiotherapy with multicatheter technique, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) using either electrons produced by linear accelerators or 50 kV x-rays (Intrabeam), the balloon-catheter technique (MammoSite), or 3D conformal external beam radiotherapy. These techniques have marked differences in dose distribution and homogeneity. The published range of local recurrence rates varies between 0% to 37%, the median follow-up from 8 to 72 months. CONCLUSIONS. To date, follow-up times mostly do not yet permit a definite judgment concerning the long-term effectiveness and side effects of APBI. The relevant societies in Germany support randomized clinical studies comparing APBI with WBRT in a well-defined subset of low-risk patients. However, the authors expressly discourage the routine use of APBI outside clinical trials. Until definite results show that APBI neither impairs therapeutic outcome nor cosmetic results, WBRT remains the gold standard in the treatment of early breast cancer. © 2007 American Cancer Society.",,0

Boost irradiation is mainly applied with fast electrons from a linear accelerator, but has been successfully performed with interstitial multicatheter-implants for several years, too. Definitive partial breast irradiation of the tumour bed, by contrast, is still regarded as an experimental approach, even for elder patients with favorable prognostic features. All treatments discussed in this article - interstitial multicatheter-brachytherapy, 3d-conformal external-beam irradiation, single-catheter brachytherapy with a balloon-catheter, intraoperative irradiation with fast electrons from a linear accelerator (IOERT) or with a 50 kV X-ray device - are accelerated therapies with a significantly reduced overall treatment time. Their biological effectiveness as well as the rate of possible late side effects cannot be accurately assessed because data with sufficient follow-up are limited. For this reason partial breast irradiation is appropriate only in the context of a randomized controlled trial. Patient selection criteria need to be stringent. Since most breast cancer patients currently receive systemic hormonal treatment or chemotherapy, which may prolong the interval to local recurrence, a definitive appraisal of the published data is not admissible. Data from randomized controlled trials with adequate follow-up is necessary. In the meantime, postoperative whole breast irradiation with or without boost irradiation remains the gold-standard after breast conserving surgery.",,0

Thus, this prospective single-center study aimed to test the feasibility of IORT at a single dose of 21 Gy in Japanese breast cancer patients. Methods: The primary endpoint was early toxicity; the secondary endpoint was late toxicity. Patients with histologically or cytologically proven primary early breast cancer were eligible. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) T < 2.5 cm; (2) desire for breast-conserving surgery; (3) age >50 years; (4) surgical margin >1 cm; (5) intraoperative pathologically free margins; and (6) sentinel node negative. Exclusion criteria were (1) contraindications to radiation therapy; (2) past radiation therapy for the same breast or chest; (3) extensive intraductal component; and (4) a tumor located in the axillary tail of the breast. All patients gave written informed consent. Partial resection was performed with at least a margin of 1 cm around the tumor. The patient was transported from the surgical suite to the radiation room. Radiation (Clinac 21EX, Varian Medical Systems, Inc.) at 21 Gy was delivered directly to the mammary gland. Toxicity was evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V4.0. Results: Five patients were enrolled in this pilot study and received 21 Gy. Follow-up ranged from 7.8 to 11.0 months (median 10.2). Intraoperative transportation to the radiation room during the surgical procedure under general anesthesia was performed safely in all patients.

Usually a needle and a ruler ('needle method' hereafter), or ultrasounds, are used before docking. A new system (MARK'S, PAF Biomedica) for accurate measurements of the gland thickness under treatment conditions was developed in Vicenza Hospital. The aim of this work is to compare the needle method to the new one in terms of surgeon-surgeon variability and dosimetric consequences. Materials and Methods: A mobile linac (LIAC, S.I.T.) with electron beams of 4 to 10 MeV (R50 ranging from 17 to 38 mm of water) was used. The MARK'S system is a sterilizable manual pointer with integrated ruler. After radioprotective disk positioning, two surgeons stitch the mammary gland to prepare the PTV, then insert the end of the applicator, after applying a thin patch layer underneath to prevent target herniation as well as bubble formation, and while the applicator is kept pressed, the pointer is inserted allowing direct thickness measurements in treatment conditions. Pointer-applicator coaxiality improves reproducibility. 14 consecutive patients were measured by two surgeons before IORT, first by the needle method, and then by MARK'S. Five measurements points were always taken at fixed positions over the PTV. Results: The needle method systematically overestimates the PTV thickness. The maximum difference between two methods was 20mm (5.4mm on the average). The surgeon-surgeon variability is 1 mm and 2 mm, for MARK'S and the needle method, respectively. If the latter was applied, 11 erroneous energy choices would occur, and 5 treatments would be canceled following ICRU71 (2004) and AAPM TG72 (2006). Conclusions: In breast IOERT, MARK'S system was verified to overcome the accuracy concerns of the traditional needle method.",,0

However, this device was taken off the market in late 2008, thus leaving a treatment void. This case study presents our experience treating a cranial lesion for the first time using a Contura multilumen, high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy balloon applicator. The patient was a 47-year-old male who was diagnosed with a recurrent right frontal anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Previous radiosurgery made him a good candidate for brachytherapy. An intracavitary HDR balloon brachytherapy device (Contura) was placed in the resection cavity and treated with a single fraction of 20 Gy. The implant, treatment, and removal of the device were all completed without incident. Dosimetry of the device was excellent because the dose conformed very well to the target. V90, V100, V150, and V200 were 98.9%, 95.7%, 27.2, and 8.8 cc, respectively. This patient was treated successfully using the Contura multilumen balloon. Contura was originally designed for deployment in a postlumpectomy breast for treatment by accelerated partial breast irradiation. Being an intracavitary balloon device, its similarity to the GliaSite system makes it a viable replacement candidate. Multiple lumens in the device also make it possible to shape the dose delivered to the target, something not possible before with the GliaSite applicator. © 2011 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists.",,0

The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate and optimize a hybrid NIR fluorescence and radioactive tracer for SLN detection in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Patients with breast cancer undergoing SLN biopsy were enrolled. The day before surgery, a periareolar injection of indocyanine green (ICG)-99mTc-radiolabelled nanocolloid was administered and a lymphoscintigram acquired. Blue dye was injected immediately before surgery. Intraoperative SLN localization was performed using a gamma probe and the Mini-FLARE NIR fluorescence imaging system. Patients were divided into two dose groups, with one group receiving twice the particle density of ICG and nanocolloid, but the same dose of radioactive 99mTc. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the trial. At least one SLN was identified before and during operation. All 48 axillary SLNs could be detected by gamma tracing and NIR fluorescence imaging, but only 42 of them stained blue. NIR fluorescence imaging permitted detection of lymphatic vessels draining to the SLN up to 29 h after injection. Doubling the particle density did not yield a difference in fluorescence intensity (median 255 (range 98-542) versus 284 (90-921) arbitrary units; P = 0.590) or signal-to-background ratio (median 5.4 (range 3.0-15.4) versus 4.9 (3.5-16.3); P = 1.000) of the SLN.

This study reports the authors' experience using this imaging modality in a large patient series. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who had undergone preoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography followed by free abdominal flap breast reconstruction was conducted. The results of imaging were compared with intraoperative findings, and surgical outcomes were compared with scan data. The results were compared with control data in patients who did not undergo presurgical imaging. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients underwent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography presurgical imaging, and the results were compared with 84 controls. The imaging was found to be accurate for evaluating the perforator anatomy for free abdominal flap planning, with a high concordance between imaging and intraoperative findings. Without presurgical angiography, the ratio of deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap-to-free transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap harvest was 0.9:1; with presurgical imaging, the ratio was 1.6:1 (p < 0.05). With presurgical angiography, there was a mean reduction in operating time of 26 minutes for unilateral DIEP flap harvest and 40 minutes for bilateral harvest, although these values were not significant. There was a significant reduction in the partial flap failure rate with preoperative imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Presurgical imaging using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography demonstrates a high concordance with intraoperative findings. In this series, the percentage of flaps that were raised as DIEP flaps was significantly increased in patients who underwent preoperative imaging, and the partial flap failure rate was significantly reduced.

Oncoplastic BCS techniques with parenchymal rearrangement present new challenges to the localisation of the tumour bed and therefore delivery of local boost radiotherapy. The aim of this review was to evaluate the reporting of boost radiotherapy in the oncoplastic BCS literature. METHODS: Pubmed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for studies reporting oncoplastic BCS using volume displacement techniques. RESULTS: 24 studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 1933 patients). Use of boost radiotherapy was reported in 11 studies, in 2 of which it was for the treatment of incomplete or close margins, and marking of the tumour bed was only reported in 8 studies. None of the studies reported the number of patients where the tumour bed could not be localised. CONCLUSIONS: The use of local boost radiotherapy and tumour bed marking was not reported in the majority of studies of oncoplastic BCS. Future studies need to provide detailed information regarding the use of boost radiotherapy and difficulties determining the target volume so that current radiotherapy approaches can be reviewed and improved for these advanced techniques.",eng,0

However, edema and fibrosis can develop after surgery and radiotherapy, which can subsequently impair quality of life. TGF- beta is a strong inducer of the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan (HA). TGF-beta expression and HA metabolism can be modulated by irradiation experimentally, and are involved in edema and fibrosis. We therefore hypothesized that IORT may regulate these factors.Wound fluid (WF) draining from breast lumpectomy sites was collected and levels of TGF-beta1 and HA were determined by ELISA. Proliferation and marker expression was analyzed in primary lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) treated with recombinant TGF-beta or WF. Our results show that IORT does not change TGF-beta1 or HA levels in wound fluid draining from breast lumpectomy sites, and does not lead to accumulation of sHA oligosaccharides. Nevertheless, concentrations of TGF-beta1 were high in WF from patients regardless of IORT, at concentrations well above those associated with fibrosis and the suppression of LEC identity. Consistently, we found that TGF-beta in WF is active and inhibits LEC proliferation. Furthermore, all three TGF-beta isoforms inhibited LEC proliferation and suppressed LEC marker expression at pathophysiologically relevant concentrations. Given that TGF-beta contributes to edema and plays a role in the regulation of LEC identity, we suggest that inhibition of TGF-beta directly after surgery might prevent the development of side effects such as edema and fibrosis.",eng,0

In this study, we have compared the mechanism of action of Ku from A3/4, a DNA sequence that appears in mammalian origins of DNA replication, and NRE1, a transcriptional regulatory element in the long terminal repeat of mouse mammary tumor virus through which Ku antigen and its associated kinase, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK(cs)), act to repress steroid-induced transcription. Our results indicate that replication from a minimal replication origin of ors8 is independent of DNA-PK(cs) and that Ku interacts with A3/4-like sequences and NRE1 in fundamentally different ways. UV crosslinking experiments revealed differential interactions of the Ku subunits with A3/4, NRE1, and two other proposed Ku transcriptional regulatory elements. In vitro footprinting experiments showed direct contact of Ku on A3/4 and over the region of ors8 homologous to A3/4. In vitro replication assays using ors8 templates bearing mutations in the A3/4-like sequence suggested that Ku binding to this element was necessary for replication. By contrast, in vitro replication experiments revealed that NRE1 was not involved in DNA replication. Our results establish A3/4 as a new class of Ku DNA binding site. Classification of Ku DNA binding into eight categories of interaction based on recognition and DNA crosslinking experiments is discussed.",eng,0

Recently, the use of partial breast intraoperative radiation (IORT) has been developed, and patients selected for IORT should not have positive margins. This study's purpose was to identify factors predicting negative margins after lumpectomy. METHODS: Patient age, preoperative investigations, surgery, final pathology, and margin status were examined using a prospective database between 1999 and 2005. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to identify patient and tumor factors predicting an increased rate of negative margins. The results were used to generate a patient selection algorithm. RESULTS: The rate of positive margins at first resection was 17% in 730 lumpectomies (708 patients). Multivariate analysis revealed that older age (P = .0006), smaller tumor size (P < .0025), type of surgery (OR = 3.4 for ultrasound vs mammogram-guided wire localization, P = .003), and having a core needle biopsy (CNB) with preoperative cancer diagnosis (P < .0001) were predictive for having a negative margin. Patients older than age 50 with a preoperative CNB showing invasive cancer less that 3 cm that can be localized under ultrasound had a negative margin rate of 98% (n = 178).

Journal Article,P. M. Schlag; A. Bembenek,2000.0,Specification of potential indications and contraindications of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer,", ","The promising results of various studies applying different methods of SN biopsy in heterogeneous patient subpopulations, show that sentinel lymph node biopsy is a reliable and minimally invasive method for the determination of the nodal status in breast cancer patients. While multicenter studies for the evaluation of the method's accuracy are still ongoing, future indications and contraindications are discussed. Based on our own experience, we try to give an actual overview of the potentials and problems of sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer. Sentinel node detection was performed in 146 patients with breast cancer stages I-III, consisting of 127pT1/2 tumors and 19pT3/4. All of them underwent standard axillary dissection after SN biopsy. Using the radionuclide method including preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma. Probe detection, the detection rate varied in relation to the tumor size between 94% for tumors with a diameter < 1 cm, 85% (1-3 cm), 70% (3-5 cm) and 63% (> 5 cm). The accuracy of the SN-biopsy in the prediction of the nodal status varied also with tumor diameter ranging from 100% for very small tumors (< 1 cm), over 97% (1-3 cm) and 88% (3-5 cm), to 67% (> 5 cm). In the subgroup of patients with pT1-2 tumors (n = 106), 57 patients (53%) showed true negative sentinel nodes, 38 (36%) revealed tumor cells in the H&E staining and an additional 7 patients (7%) solely in the immunohistochemical staining. 4 (4%) of these patients, all of them from the first half of the study period, underwent false-negative SN-biopsy, all of them showing lymphangiosis carcinomatosa and/or extensive infiltration of the metastatic lymph node(s). The results presented show, that in about 50% of early breast cancer patients surgical intervention could potentially be avoided after a negative SN-biopsy, and an additional 5-10% of conventionally nodal negative patients can be found by immunohistochemical examination of the sentinel node. The SN concept is not recommended in clinically nodal positive patients or advanced disease. Potential applications include the evaluation of parasternal lymph nodes and patients with recurrent tumor. Before clinical application, quality control of the medical center and the performing surgeon have to be established potentially including the performance of about 20 procedures under supervision for each surgeon, an individual accuracy of at least 93%, and the possibility of immunohistochemical staining as well as a regular follow-up.",eng,0

Materials and Methods: From February to December 2011, we treated 40 patients aged 36 to 85 (median 62) years by intraoperative HDRafterloading brachytherapy intended as a tumour bed boost. Preoperative indication for boost irradiation was G2 or G3 differentiation in the biopsy specimen. Patients were eligible for the method with cT1 (n=31) or small cT2 (n=9) tumours, no multicentricity, and a skin-tumour-distance of > 1.5 cm. After tumour excision and balloon catheter implantation (filling volumes 35-50 ml, median 35 ml) into the tumour bed, the wound is temporarily closed with close adaptation of tissue to the balloon, leaving only the connecting catheter outside, and covered with sterile transparent drape. Accompanied by breast surgeon and anaesthesiologist, the patient is transferred in anaesthesia to the brachytherapy unit, and treated with an applicator surface dose of 20 Gy using standard plans calculated for different applicator volumes. Skin dose close to the applicator is monitored by in vivo dosimetry. After treatment, the patient is brought back to the operation theatre, the applicator is removed and oncoplastic surgery finished. Percutaneous whole breast radiotherapy was started 33 to 63 (median 42) days after IORT in patients not receiving chemotherapy. In the case histology reveals indications for chemotherapy whole breast radiotherapy is done thereafter. Results: Prolongation of anaesthesia due to irradiation time and transport was 40 minutes in mean. Balloon volumes ranged from 35-50 ml, resulting in 8.8-9.5 Gy in 1cm depth. Measured skin dose ranged from 1.381 to 8.8 Gy. Acute and subacute side effects were mild to moderate and consisted mainly in erythema, oedema or induration of the surgical site. Major haematoma leading to intervention or infection was not observed. Incidence of seroma was not higher than usual. Four patients witHDRew their consent to percutaneous therapy after IORT and thus received no further treatment. During further follow-up, no difference in toxicity was seen compared to percutaneous 3D-planned boost after whole breast radiotherapy. Conclusions: This IORT method is easily feasible and does not lead to severe specific side effects. Being an IORT procedure, it avoids geographic miss of the tumour bed. In patients receiving chemotherapy, the IORT boost of 20 Gy may lead to better local control. The structural requirements (architecture, brachytherapy unit) given, it offers the possibility of breast IORT for departments with small numbers of eligible patients on a pay per performance basis (only the patient-dependent cost of the catheters).",,0

If surgery and/or radiotherapy are no longer possible, this innovative technology can be used effectively for local tumour control. The minor side effects of the therapy and the low intraoperative duration of treatment make it possible to admit patients to hospital for just a short time. Thus, the repeated use of electrochemotherapy has allowed for an increase in the rate of complete remissions. In fact, in 2013, this form of treatment, which consists of a low-dose cytostatic and electroporation, was also included in the mammary guidelines of the Working Group for Gynaecological Oncology (AGO) and the German Cancer Society (DKG). The favourable cost-benefit ratio makes this method of treatment very interesting in clinical practice and, as a result, it is already being used successfully in many German hospitals.

Metastases are mainly located in the vertebral body and in case of pain e.g. due to fracture minimal invasive cement augmentation is increasingly used for pain reduction. However sterilization of the metastasis for local control is the domain of radiotherapy. For local control recent studies showed better results by applying high radiation doses in a single fraction. We therefore developed a combined kyphoplasty and intraoperative single fraction radiation with the potential for high local dose application.We report the first early clinical results. Material and methods: Patients with maximal 3 painful and/or instable metastatic lesions eligible for cement augmentation who attended at least one follow-up (first 6 weeks, then 2-3 months intervals) were included. Local pain was assessed by 10 point VAS, local control and general progression by CT or MRI. Results: 19 patients were included,although one had clinical followup but no imaging. Mean age was 61 +/- 9,5 years, 15 females and 4 males. Main tumor entity was breast cancer in 12 patients. 22 vertebrae were treated with a mean surgical time of 73 +/- 28minutes. In one patient due to distortion no radiation could be applied. This was rated as failure in addition with 1 loacl recurrence is 2 of 19 (11%). No other complications requiring intervention occurred. VAS dropped from preop. mean 5 to 2 on day 1, and 1at first follow-up. Discussion: Kypho-IORT shows a fast pain relief and low surgical risk profile such as in kyphoplasty. Local metastatic control is good in short term. However before final evaluation larger long term studies must be accomplished. Conclusion: Early results show an acceptable clinical success concerning pain, risk profile and local control which allow further evaluation of this treatment.",,0

As local treatment for the malignant disease usually a percutaneous radiation with 30-40Gy in 10-20 treatment sessions over a period of 2 - 4 weeks is applied. A minimal invasiv, simultaneous combination of surgical and radiation therapy could be, especially against the background of coexisting morbidities, reduced general condition and shorter tretament period, be beneficial. An interdisciplinary group of orthopedic surgeons, trauma surgeons and radiation oncologists developed in cooperation with a manufacturer of radiation applicators the technical requirements. Therefore a special application system on the base of a commercial system was developed. Radiation was applied by an established intraoperative radiation device with an effective dose of 60 Gy in the vertebral body. After cadaver studies with check-up of the technical feasibility and securring radiation safety a clinical feasibility study was initiated. Indications were: isolated or isolated symptomatic (1-3) spinal metastases between Th3 and S1. Indication was set in the interdisiplinary tumer board. The method and results of the first 12 clinical implemetations are presented. 12 patients (6 x Mamma, 2 x Prostate, each 1x Lung, Liver, Rectum, Gastric), average age 64 years, pain VAS pre OP 4,8, after surgery 3, in patient treatment 5,3 days could be treated in average 81 minutes surgical time in 14 vertebral bodies. In 2 of 14 vertebrae radiation had to be aborted. Once due to bending of the applicator with possible damage to the radiation source. In the other case despite multipel attempts a sufficient placement of the radiation source could not be achieved. In all other cases the planed radiation dose could be applied. radiation specific complications did not occur. The usual minor complications by kyphoplasty, such as asymptomatic cement extravasation or local hematoma occured. Due to the good technical feasibility and acceptable intraoperative complications, comparable to sole kyphoplasty, the feasibility study was rated successfull.

For situations where a flat area (up to 6 cm in diameter) has to be treated intraoperatively, new applicators for superficial treatment with a miniature X-ray source (INTRABEAM system) were developed. Here we report our evaluation of the dosimetric characteristics of these new applicators and their first clinical use. Each of these flat and surface applicators consists of a radiation protective metal tube and a flattening filter, which converts the spherical dose distribution of the X-ray source into a flat one. The homogeneity of each dose distribution and depth-dose measurements were evaluated using film dosimetry in a solid water phantom and a soft X-ray ionization chamber in a water tank. The first patient was treated with 5 Gy delivered in 5 mm using a 4 cm FLAT applicator over 21 minutes. The flat applicators show the maximum homogeneity, with a uniformity ratio of 1.02-1.08 in certain depths. In 1 mm depth surface applicators show a uniformity ratio of 1.15-1.28. They also show a higher dose rate and a steeper dose gradient compared to the flat applicators. The results of this investigation demonstrated that the flat and surface applicators have unique dosimetric characteristics that need to be considered during the treatment planning stages. This work also showed that it is possible to perform a superficial localized IORT which provides new application possibilities for use of the INTRABEAM system.",,0

In order to identify the patients egliable for this procedure and to obtain low re-excision rates after IORT we investigated the role of additional preoperative MRI and intraoperative frozen sections in decision making of IORT in boost modality. Materials: From february 2009 to february 2010 every patient with histologically proven invasive carcinoma, T<inf>1</inf> and T<inf>2</inf>, N<inf>0</inf> and N<inf>+</inf> and supposed unicentricity by palpation, mammography and ultrasound was enrolled in the study. In every patient we performed MRI scanning of the breast preoperatively. During surgery in every patient frozen section of the margins and of all additional MRI marked lesions not biopsied before was performed. IOERT in boost modality was applied after verified unicentric disease and free margins by frozen section with the mobile electron beam accelerator Mobetron with a dose of 9 Gy. Results: A total of 209 patients were enrolled in the study. The median age of our patients was 60,6 years, the median tumor size was 14,8 mm. In 78% of the patients a nodal involvement was missing, 58,9% of the tumors were G2, 87,6% hormonreceptor positive and 90,4% HER 2 negative. The most frequent histologic subtype was the ductal carcinoma. In 169 patients the IOERT-boost was performed, in 40 patients the decision against IOERT was made according to the frozen section result during surgery.In 17,6% MRI showing multicentricity was the reason for decision making against IORT. In 37,6% we decided against the boost because of extensive intraductal lesions or microinvasive components seen in frozen section. In 36% we hadn't enough tissue to mobilize for performing the boost after the resection of the tumor. In 10% we found other reasons especially problems concerning general anaesthesia not permitting us the time to perform the boost. By using MRI in 5,7% of the patients multicentricity was detected precluding BCT and IORT, in 12,0% of the patients the resection volume was modified by the results of MRI and frozen sections. Frozen section of the margins played an important role by detection of DCIS- and microinvasive components: in 7,2% of the patients extensive multifocality or multicentricity was detected precluding BCT and IORT, in 14,8% of the patients with IORT resurgery after IORT was prevented. Conclusions: MRI and mainly frozen section are important tools to lower the rate of resurgery after IORT: 22,5% (47/209) of all study patients had a benefit.",,0

Traditional costing methods reflect charges rather than fundamental costs to provide a service. The more rigorous method of time-driven activity-based costing was used to compare cost between whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) using balloon-based brachytherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For WBRT (25 fractions with five-fraction boost) and APBI (10 fractions twice daily), process maps were created outlining each activity from consultation to post-treatment follow up. Through staff interviews, time estimates were obtained for each activity. The capacity cost rates (CCR), defined as cost per minute, were calculated for personnel, equipment, and physical space. Total cost was calculated by multiplying the time required of each resource by its CCR. This was then summed and combined with cost of consumable materials. RESULTS: The total cost for WBRT was $5,333 and comprised 56% personnel costs and 44% space/equipment costs. For APBI, the total cost was $6,941 (30% higher than WBRT) and comprised 51% personnel costs, 6% space/equipment costs, and 43% consumable materials costs. The attending physician had the highest CCR of all personnel ($4.28/min), and APBI required 24% more attending time than WBRT. The most expensive activity for APBI was balloon placement and for WBRT was computed tomography simulation. CONCLUSION: APBI cost more than WBRT when using the dose/fractionation schemes analyzed. Future research should use time-driven activity-based costing to better understand cost with the aim of reducing expenditure and defining bundled payments.",eng,0

This study evaluates the use of electronic brachytherapy with a disposable balloon applicator for IORT delivery at a single institution in an IRB-approved clinical trial setting. Method: continues Women who were >40 years of age having a single focus of biopsy-proven infiltrating ductal carcinoma measuring <2.5 cm were eligible for this clinical trial. Preoperative work-up included a mammogram, ultrasound, and bilateral breast MRI. Axillary lymph nodes were cleared radiographically and by examination. Once in the operating room, each patient was first subjected to a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with intraoperative touch prep cytology confirmation that the SLNs were cancer free. This was followed by a lumpectomy with radiographic and gross evaluation of margins. Those patients with cancer-free SLNs and adequate margins by intraoperative evaluation were treated with IORT. The disposable balloon applicator was placed into the lumpectomy site along with a chest wall shield. The cavity was closed leaving >1-cm distance between the balloon surface and the skin. Electronic brachytherapy was used intraoperatively to deliver a single 20-Gy fraction. The balloon and shield were then removed and the operation completed in a standard fashion. The patients have been seen in follow-up and have received postoperative mammograms and ultrasounds at prescribed intervals. Results : Forty-four women, average age 63.3 years, with a single focus of infiltrating ductal carcinoma (average size, 1.04 cm) were enrolled in a 1-year period beginning on November 1, 2011. All patients were taken to the operating room with the intent to receive IORT. One patient did not undergo IORT due to technical difficulties. Four patients who had positive SLNs intraoperatively were not treated with IORT. The remaining 39 patients received IORT as a single 20-Gy fraction with an average delivery time of 516 seconds. The procedure averaged 1 hour and 35 minutes. Two patients were found to have positive margins on final pathology and required re-excision. Two patients had positive SLNs on final pathology and required WBRT. Thirty-five (79.5%) patients were successfully treated with IORT and are being followed. Postoperatively, 6 of these patients were treated with chemotherapy on the basis of tissue prognostic markers. Three patients had infections requiring prolonged antibiotics. Four patients had postoperative seromas documented by serial ultrasound. Thirty-three of the 35 patients treated with IORT rated their cosmetic result as good to excellent. There have been no recurrences in an average follow-up of 7 months. Conclusions : Early IORT experience using electronic brachytherapy with a disposable balloon applicator have been favorable. Long-term follow-up is needed to document the safety and clinical efficacy of this treatment.",,0

Suitability criteria have been established for pts receiving accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) by the American Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). Certain pts (women aged > 70 with ES estrogen receptor (ER) positive (+) cancers) may not benefit from any radiation therapy (XRT) and could be treated with endocrine therapy alone. Conversely, pts with high RS (HRS) have been shown to have higher local recurrence (LR) rates which are not improved by the addition of tamoxifen when compared to placebo. Pts undergoing IORT were evaluated by ASTRO APBI guidelines and RS with a comparison of the results. Methods: Outcomes of consented pts completing IORT (11/ 2011 - 5/ 2013) per protocol in a single institution IRB approved clinical trial were reviewed. Data collection included demographics, histopathology, prognostic factors, RS, adjuvant therapy, LR, and survival. Results: 100 pts (aged 43-96, mean 63) completed IORT per protocol. 16 (16%) pts had DCIS (mean size 0.7 cm). 84 (84%) pts had invasive carcinoma (IC) (mean size 1.0 cm): ductal - 82 pts, lobular - 2 pts, which was ER positive (+) in 76 (90%) pts. RS was obtained in 65 (86%) IC patients with ER+ cancers. The remaining IC pts declined (4 pts) or had cancers <5mm (7 pts). Low (L) RS was found in 44 (67%) pts, intermediate (I) RS in 16 (25%) pts, and HRS in 5 (8%) pts. These 65 patients were classified using ASTRO APBI guidelines with 40 (62%) ranked as Suitable"", 18 (27%) ""Cautionary"", and 7 (11%) ""Unsuitable"". IORT pts received adjuvant therapy per current standards. At median follow up of 36 months, there has been one LR (age 98, HRS at recurrence; pt declined RS testing and endocrine therapy at age 96 with initial diagnosis), and one breast cancer related death (age 50, ER negative, Her2neu +). Conclusions: The 21 gene RS assay may be an independent additional prognostic factor which will be useful in making appropriate therapeutic recommendations for IORT patients. Longer follow up is necessary.""",,0

Methods: A survey of the literature was performed including publications between 2002 and 2012 (PubMed). Strategies comprised partial breast radiotherapy by external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), interstitial brachytherapy (BT) in low-, high- and pulse-dose rate technique, combined EBRT/BT, and intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT). Results: Published evidence is scarce, with altogether ten articles identified, in sum reporting about 310 patients. The vast majority (82%) was treated by brachytherapy. Selection criteria for a second breast conservation attempt were comparable within all reports: all women showed up with T1-2 recurrent lesions, late onset after primary treatment (70 months, mean of means) and no evidence of metastatic disease before undergoing gross tumor resection with free surgical margins. Treatment doses were in a similar range for brachytherapy (LDR 30-55 Gy, HDR 30-34 Gy; PDR 40-50 Gy), biologically comparable to the only pure EBRT series (50 Gy). Followup times amounted 49 months (mean of the means, range 21-89). Oncologic results were similar among the different methods with local control rates ranging between 76% and 100%, and disease free and overall survival rates comparable to mastectomy series. Acute toxicity was low in all cohorts. All authors reported about cosmetic outcome, scoring results from excellent to good in 60-80% of patients, mostly without using standardized evaluation schemes. Major alterations were fibrosis in double-irradiated parenchyma as a function of dose and volume, asymmetry (primarily due to double surgery), and breast pain. There were hardly any G3 and no G4 late reactions noted. Conclusion: In a highly selected group of patients with IBTR, partial breast irradiation after second BCS is a viable alternative to mastectomy, yielding high breast preservation rates without compromising oncologic safety. Whereas the evidence for brachytherapy is more solid, there is still little information about the effectiveness of PBI via EBRT or novel strategies like IORT, which therefore should preferably be investigated within trials.",,0

A collaborative analysis has been performed by member institutions of the European Group of the ISIORT for long term outcome evaluation of this strategy. Materials: 1110 patients have been identified until 10/05 among seven institutions using parallel methods, sequencing and dosage for intra-and postoperative radiotherapy. Fifty-two percent of the patients (586 pat.) presented with at least one adverse prognostic factor such as larger tumor size, high grading, young age and/or positive nodes. were directly applied to the tumor bed. A median single fractional dose of 10 Gy (range 6-17, SD 0,9) was applied to the tumor bed (90% reference isodose), mainly by electron energies of 4, 6 and 8 MeV (range 4 to 18), using round perspex tubes with 5-8cm diameter. Whole-breast irradiation with 50-54Gy was performed after a median time span of 48 days (range 16-357, SD 47,6 ).96,6% of the patients received additional adjuvant systemic therapy. Results: As of March 09, only 16 in-breast recurrences were observed in 1110 patients with a median follow up period of 73,3 months yielding a local tumor control rate of 99,2%. No follow up data were available for 3 patients. 954 patients are alive without evident breast disease at 7 years follow up. 111 patients developed metastases (50 are still alive).108 patients have died, 57 of them from cancer and 13 from a secondary tumor. Recurrences occurred 20-151 months after primary treatment. At 7 years 87,8 % of patients maintain disease free survival, 93,3 % disease specific survival and 89,7 % overall survival. In univariate analysis, age, grading, hormonal receptor status and hormonal therapy turned out to be significantly predictive for the development of in-breast recurrence, in multivariate analysis only grade 3 reached significance (p=0,024). Nodal status and dimension of time delay between IOERT and WBRT showed no influence.In analysis along patient age, annual in-breast recurrence rates amounted 0,64 %, 0,34 %, 0,21 % and 0,16 % in patients < 40 a; 40-49 a; 50-59 a and > 60a, respectively. Conclusions: In all risk subgroups, IOERT as anticipating boost strategy prior to WBRT achieves outstanding local tumor control rates in long term observation, comparing favourably to all trials with similar lenght of follow up.",,0

Kranzinger,1996.0,Quality assurance in breast cancer brachytherapy: geographic miss in the interstitial boost treatment of the tumor bed,", ","PURPOSE: To assess the role of geographic misses in the interstitial boost treatment of breast cancer patients and to evaluate methods of optimizing breast implants in design, performance, and dosimetry. METHODS AND MATERIALS: During lumpectomy, the tumor excision sites of 89 patients were marked by five hemoclips. Postoperative radiographs demonstrated the clips' positions with respect to the extension of the surgical cavity, which was demarcated by air and hematoseroma. Twenty-seven selected patients received interstitial boosts to the tumor bed. The implant was first designed according to the clinical assumptions of the tumor bed's topography and then compared with the radiological findings. Prior to brachytherapy, the planning of the implant's dimension and the needle guidance was performed under simulator control. Dose distributions were first calculated following the Paris System and then electively optimized for the target volume by changing source positions and dwell times. RESULTS: Compared to clinical estimations, the radiological determination of the tumor bed's location revealed an overall potential of topographic errors of 51.8% (14 out of 27 patients), rising up to 78.5% in patients with large adipose breasts (11 out of 13 patients). This observation was due to a high mobility of the tissue, leading to varying tumor site projections at the time of mammography, surgery, and brachytherapy. In all patients, the presimulation of the implant resulted in an adequate coverage of the target volume. In 17 of the 27 treated patients, dose distributions were modified to achieve a higher dose delivery in zones where a higher residual tumor load was expected (boost-in-boost). CONCLUSION: Breast implants have a high potential of geographic misses that can be avoided by intraoperative clip demarcation. The delineation of the tumor bed allows for dose reports actually referring to the target volume and not to the implant system to be obtained. In addition, modern afterloading techniques offer possibilities of individual dose planning with regard to high risk subvolumes within the implanted tissue.",eng,0

The largest evidence for boost IORT preceding whole breast irradiation (WBI) originates from intraoperative electron treatments with single doses around 10 Gy, providing outstandingly low local recurrence rates in any risk constellation also at long term analyses. Compared to other boost methods, an intraoperative treatment has evident advantages as follows. Precision. Direct visualisation of the tumour bed during surgery guarantees an accurate dose delivery. This fact has additionally gained importance in times of primary reconstruction techniques after lumpectomy to optimise cosmetic outcome. IORT is performed before breast tissue is mobilised for plastic purposes. Cosmesis. As a consequence of direct tissue exposure without distension by hematoma/seroma, IORT allows for small treatment volumes and complete skin sparing, both having a positive effect on late tissue tolerance and, hence, cosmetic appearance. Patient Comfort. Boost IORT marginally prolongs the surgical procedure, while significantly shortening postoperative radiotherapy. Its combination with a 3-week hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy to the whole breast (WBI) is presently tested in the HIOB trial (hypofractionated WBI preceded by IORT electron boost), a prospective multicenter trial of the International Society of Intraoperative Radiotherapy (ISIORT).

The present recommendations are based on a revision of the German interdisciplinary S-3 guidelines published in July 2012. Methods: A comprehensive survey of the literature concerning radiotherapy following breast conserving therapy (BCT) was performed using the search terms breast cancer"", ""radiotherapy"", and ""breast conserving therapy"". Data from lately published meta-analyses, recent randomized trials, and guidelines of international breast cancer societies, yielding new aspects compared to 2007, provided the basis for defining recommendations according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine. In addition to the more general statements of the DKG (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft), this paper addresses indications, target definition, dosage, and technique of radiotherapy of the breast after conservative surgery for invasive breast cancer. Results: Among numerous reports on the effect of radiotherapy during BCT published since the last recommendations, the recent EBCTCG report builds the largest meta-analysis so far available. In a 15 year follow-up on 10,801 patients, whole breast irradiation (WBI) halves the average annual rate of disease recurrence (RR 0.52, 0.48-0.56) and reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by about one sixth (RR 0.82, 0.75-0.90), with a similar proportional, but different absolute benefit in prognostic subgroups (EBCTCG 2011). Furthermore, there is growing evidence that risk-adapted dose augmentation strategies to the tumor bed as well as the implementation of high precision RT techniques (e.g., intraoperative radiotherapy) contribute substantially to a further reduction of local relapse rates. A main focus of ongoing research lies in partial breast irradiation strategies as well as WBI hypofractionation schedules. The potential of both in replacing normofractionated WBI has not yet been finally clarified. Conclusion: After breast conserving surgery, no subgroup even in low risk patients has yet been identified for whom radiotherapy can be safely omitted without compromising local control and, hence, cancer-specific survival. In most patients, this translates into an overall survival benefit. © 2013 The Authors.""",,0

To perform the study, depth dose curves were calculated using a general purpose multi-particle transport code (FLUKA) for a range of balloon wall thicknesses with and without barium impregnation. Numerical data were verified with experimental readings using a parallel plate extrapolation ionization chamber for different wall thicknesses. Depth dose curves computed using both numerical and experimental methods show a 6.0% attenuation of the dose at the 1.0 cm prescription line due to the impregnation of barium in the balloon material, which agrees well with the manufacturer's specification. By applying this single attenuation factor, dose calculations throughout the entire planned volume are uniformly affected. However, at the balloon surface, attenuation on the order of 18.0% is observed. The AAPM TG-43 source data currently incorporated in commercially-available treatment planning systems do not account for the variable dose distributions attributable to balloon wall attenuation. Our results show that variable attenuation factors that may have clinical significance should be applied in order to determine near-surface dose distributions when using barium impregnated balloons for intracavitary breast brachytherapy. Dose distributions at distances greater than 1 cm from the surface of the balloon appear to be accurately represented without further modification.",,0

Pre-operative assessment using a variety of imaging techniques has become increasingly popular to assess the anatomy of the abdominal perforators. We hypothesize that color flow duplex ultrasonography is a reliable method for mapping the abdominal perforator anatomy and avoids the complications associated with other methods. MATERIAL/METHODS: A prospective study of 40 consecutive patients was performed. Pre-operative color flow duplex ultrasound evaluation was compared to intra-operative findings of the dominant epigastric perforator selected at the time of flap harvest. RESULTS: Forty consecutive patients were evaluated prospectively. Forty six flaps were harvested from these patients (6 bilateral cases). A single perforator which was identified by both pre-operatively and at the time of intra-operative flap harvest as the dominant perforator was identified in 36 of 46 flaps (78.3%). The intra-operative perforator chosen at the time of flap harvest was identified as one of the pre-operative perforators marked by duplex ultrasonography in 45 or 46 patients (97.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative duplex ultrasonography is a safe and reliable tool for assessing the abdominal epigastric perforators used in autologous microvascular breast reconstruction. Advantages of this technique are: it is non-invasive, it does not require contrast agent application, no radiation, and it is inexpensive when compared to other imaging modalities.",eng,0

Butler,2015.0,Critical Evaluation of Risk Factors and Early Complications in 564 Consecutive Two-Stage Implant-Based Breast Reconstructions Using Acellular Dermal Matrix at a Single Center,10.1097/prs.0000000000001327,"BACKGROUND: Acellular dermal matrix for implant-based breast reconstruction appears to cause higher early complication rates, but long-term outcomes are perceived to be superior. This dichotomy is the subject of considerable debate. The authors hypothesized that patient characteristics and operative variables would have a greater impact on complications than the type of acellular dermal matrix used. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of consecutive patients who underwent two-stage, implant-based breast reconstruction with human cadaveric or bovine acellular dermal matrix from 2006 to 2012 at a single institution. Patient characteristics and operative variables were analyzed using logistic regression analyses to identify risk factors for complications. RESULTS: The authors included 564 reconstructions in the study. Radiation therapy and obesity increased the odds of all complications. Every 100-ml increase in preoperative breast volume increased the odds of any complication by 1 percent, the odds of infection by 27 percent, and the risk of explantation by 16 percent. The odds of seroma increased linearly with increasing surface area of acellular dermal matrix. Odds of infection were higher with an intraoperative expander fill volume greater than 50 percent of the total volume. Risk of explantation was twice as high when intraoperative expander fill volume was greater than 300 ml. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation therapy, obesity, larger breasts, higher intraoperative fill volumes, and larger acellular dermal matrices are all independent risk factors for early complications. Maximizing the initial mastectomy skin envelope fill must be balanced with the understanding that higher complication rates may result from a larger intraoperative breast mound.

The mean dose measured was about 58% of the prescription dose for the patients treated using the MammoSite technique. On the other hand, for patients treated with IMRT and tangential fields, the mean dose was found to be about 69% and 71% of the corresponding prescription dose.

Gross,2014.0,For-profit hospital ownership status and use of brachytherapy after breast-conserving surgery,10.1016/j.surg.2013.12.009,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the relationship between operative care for breast cancer at for-profit hospitals and subsequent use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). Among Medicare beneficiaries, we examined whether hospital ownership status is associated with the use of breast brachytherapy--a newer and more expensive modality--as well as overall RT. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of female Medicare beneficiaries who received breast-conserving surgery for invasive breast cancer in 2008 and 2009. We assessed the relationship between hospital ownership and receipt of brachytherapy or overall RT by using hierarchical generalized linear models. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 35,118 women, 8.0% of whom had breast-conserving operations at for-profit hospitals. Among patients who received RT, those who underwent operation at for-profit hospitals were more likely to receive brachytherapy (20.2%) than patients treated at not-for-profit hospitals (15.2%; odds ratio [OR] for for-profit versus not-for-profit: 1.50; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.23-1.84; P < .001). Among women aged 66-79 years, there was no relationship between hospital ownership status and overall use of RT. Among women ages 80-94 years of age--the group least likely to benefit from RT due to shorter life expectancy--undergoing breast-conserving operations at a for-profit hospital was associated with greater overall use of RT (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.03-1.45, P = .03) and brachytherapy use (OR 1.66; 95% CI 1.18-2.34, P = .003). CONCLUSION: Operative care at for-profit hospitals was associated with increased use of the newer and more expensive RT modality, brachytherapy. Among the oldest women who are least likely to benefit from RT, operative care at a for-profit hospital was associated with greater overall use of RT, with this difference largely driven by the use of brachytherapy.",eng,0

Case report],", ","Among the rare anomalies of the breast development, polythelia is the most common, between 1% and 5% of women and men present supernumerary nipples. Polymastia, usually presenting as ectopic breast tissue without areola-nipple complex, is seen mostly along the milk line, extending from the axilla to the pubic region. Ectopic breast tissue is functionally analogous to mammary gland and it is subjected to the same alterations and diseases, whether benign or malignant, that affect normal breast tissue. We report the case of a 21 years-old female evaluated by the medical staff after founding a solid nodular mass by suspect axillary lymphadenopathy. Differential diagnosis with lymphoma is the major problem in these cases. The mass was removed and the intraoperative histological examination showed fibroadenoma in axillary supernumerary breast. Presence of ectopic breast tissue is a rare condition; development of benign mass or malignant degeneration is possible, but it is very unusual. In case of polymastia diagnosis is simple; in case of isolated nodule, without local inflammation or infection, there are greater difficulties. Ultrasonography is diagnostic in case of breast fibroadenoma, but it might be inadequate in ectopic localizations owing to the shortage of mammary tissue around the mass. Preoperative diagnosis is important to plan an adequate surgical treatment; lumpectomy is indicated in case of benign tissue; in case of malignancy, therapy is based on the standard treatment used for breast cancer (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy).",ita,0

MMMT accounts for less than 2% of ovarian cancers and has a very poor prognosis. We present a case and difficulties of diagnosing an ovarian MMMT in a postmenopausal woman with a history of invasive breast carcinoma treated postoperatively with radiotherapy and tamoxifen. A 52-year-old patient presented with unilateral ovarian tumor and moderately elevated CA125 (107 U/mL) and underwent laparotomy. Fine needle aspiration of the ovary and ascites for cytologic analysis, and tumor biopsy for histopathology were performed intraoperatively. Intraoperative cytologic sample showed necrotic background with rare single malignant cells with pale, abundant cytoplasm and conspicuous nucleoli suggesting clear cell carcinoma. Ascites sample showed inflammatory and reactive background with suspected papillary formations mimicking adenocarcinoma. Postoperatively, cytochemical PAS staining and immunocytologic staining with epithelial antigen (EA), cytokeratin (CK)7 and vimentin showed EA and PAS positivity for ovarian tumor, and EA and CK7 for ascites, suggesting a clear cell carcinoma. Histology revealed ovarian clear cell carcinoma. Three months later, the patient underwent hemicolectomy because of tumors on the right large bowel serosa with intraoperative morphological finding of metastatic malignant tumor without other specific features. Postoperative morphological analysis and immunohistochemical staining of the tumor revealed two malignant components, epithelial and stromal one. Repeat histologic analysis of the ovarian tumor confirmed ovarian MMMT (with a clear cell carcinoma component). Other studies of breast cancer emphasize that patients with invasive breast cancer and mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are at an increased risk of primary ovarian cancer. Our study confirmed it and suggested considering a second primary malignant tumor of ovarian origin in patients with a history of breast carcinoma, postoperatively treated with radiotherapy and tamoxifen.

The authors evaluated and compare outcomes following reconstruction with and without acellular dermis, and analyzed patients exposed to radiation therapy. METHODS: Retrospective review of 417 consecutive patients (592 breasts) treated from January of 2006 to October of 2008 at one institution was performed. Relevant patient characteristics and follow-up were recorded. Complications were categorized by type and end outcome, including nonoperative, operative, or explantation. Both groups had comparable follow-up (acellular dermis, 23.2 +/- 8.9 months; no acellular dermis, 24.4 +/- 12.7 months; p = 0.23). Appropriate statistical analyses, including multiple regression, were performed. RESULTS: Acellular dermis patients (n = 199 breasts) had larger body mass indexes (p = 0.0001) and more nipple-sparing mastectomies (p = 0.04) than non-acellular dermis patients (n = 393 breasts). Breasts with acellular dermis had larger intraoperative fill volumes (p < 0.0001) and decreased postoperative expansions (p = 0.02), but no decrease in time to implant exchange. There were no significant differences in complication profiles between acellular dermis and non-acellular dermis breasts, after adjusting for other relevant patient variables on regression analysis. After stratifying patients by exposure to radiation, acellular dermis breasts had a decreased risk of all complications related to radiation as compared with non-acellular dermis breasts. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that acellular dermis does not adversely affect complication rates following prosthetic breast reconstruction. It may be advantageous, however, in select patients, particularly those undergoing postoperative radiation therapy. Therefore, the choice to use acellular dermis does not compromise outcomes but should be individualized to each patient.",eng,0

For this reason, in vivo film dosimetry (IVFD) proves to be an effective methodology to evaluate the actual radiation dose delivered to the target. A practical method for IVFD during breast IOERT was carried out to improve information on the dose actually delivered to the tumor target and on the alignment of the shielding disk with respect to the electron beam. Two EBT3 GAFCHROMIC films have been positioned on the two sides of the shielding disk in order to obtain the dose maps at the target and beyond the disk. Moreover the postprocessing analysis of the dose distribution measured on the films provides a quantitative estimate of the misalignment between the collimator and the disk. EBT3 radiochromic films have been demonstrated to be suitable dosimeters for IVD due to their linear dose-optical density response in a narrow range around the prescribed dose, as well as their capability to be fixed to the shielding disk without giving any distortion in the dose distribution. Off-line analysis of the radiochromic film allowed absolute dose measurements and this is indeed a very important verification of the correct exposure to the target organ, as well as an estimate of the dose to the healthy tissue underlying the shielding. These dose maps allow surgeons and radiation oncologists to take advantage of qualitative and quantitative feedback for setting more accurate treatment strategies and further optimized procedures. The proper alignment using elastic bands has improved the absolute dose accuracy and the collimator disk alignment by more than 50%.",,0

The risk assessment was carried out before starting clinical trials and was integrated with a predictive matrix risk analysis (FMECA). Even after the introduction of corrective actions, the highest score was attributed to the misalignment of the internal shield which was used to protect the underlying normal tissues. In November 2014, we began using the new HIOB protocol (IOERT 11.1 Gy, WBERT 2.7 Gy in 15 fractions) and at the same time Intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS) was introduced based on the recommendation of HIOB protocol in order to accurately measure depth of target and accordingly selection of the proper electron energy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of intraoperative ultrasonography in reducing risk and improving quality of breast IOERT. Material and Method: From November 2014 till now 20 patients have been treated using the HIOB protocol. In every treatment after positioning the shield and reconstructing the target, the measurement of target thickness was performed five times by surgeons using both needle and intraoperative ultrasonography. The correct positioning of the shielding disk was also verified by ultrasound probe. The verification procedure of shield positioning was performed using a protocol developed at our center to also evaluate in vivo dosimetry"" as following: two layers of radiochromic films (Gafchromic EBT3) with the same size of the shielding disk were prepared and were fixed on both disk's sides by sterile tape. Eventually, all the relevant data related to target and pectoralis muscle dose as well as shield alignment were obtained with the calibrated EBT3. Results: Comparison between the measurement of target thickness obtained with ultrasonography and needle showed a good agreement for all the 20 patients and a negligible mean difference was reported in the order of 0.1mm (ranged from 0.1-1.2 mm). The results of in-vivo dosimetry with EBT3 demonstrated that applying intraoperative ultrasonography could reduce misalignment between electron field and shielding disk (in terms of electrons field area outside the shielding disk) from 5.4 cm<sup>2</sup> to 3.0 cm<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, the percentage of patients in whom the shielding disk was perfectly aligned (when field is totally inside the shield) was improved from 22% to 58%. Conclusions: As a conclusion, intraoperative ultrasonography has improved the accuracy in the measurement of the target depth which leads to the excellent results in terms of delivered target dose. In addition, IOUS can optimize patient safety by reducing alignment error between target and shield with a significant reduction of the undesirable dose.""",,0

However, electrons can potentially provide inadequate coverage. The MammoSite breast brachytherapy applicator may provide dosimetric advantages in the delivery of an operative bed boost and its role in this setting is not yet defined. Materials and methods: The study population consisted of 15 patients with early stage breast cancer treated with partial breast irradiation (PBI) using the MammoSite device. For each patient, a theoretical boost plan using electrons and a second theoretical boost plan using the MammoSite applicator were created. To assess the adequacy of each boost plan, the PTV V90, PTV V95, and PTV V100 were calculated. To assess dose to normal tissues, the ipsilateral breast V50, ipsilateral lung V30, and heart V20 were calculated. Results: The mean PTV V100 for the MammoSite boost was 95.5%, compared to 77.4% for the electron boost (p<0.001). The mean PTV V95 was 97.8%, compared to 93.3% for the electron boost (p=0.02). The mean PTV V90, mean breast V50, mean lung V30, and mean heart V20 were not statistically different for MammoSite compared to electrons. Conclusions: A tumor bed boost using the MammoSite breast brachytherapy applicator provides superior target coverage and delivers similar doses to the ipsilateral breast and lung compared to a boost delivered with electrons. More investigation into the role of balloon brachytherapy in the delivery of a breast boost is warranted. © 2009 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.",,0

As the number of breast cancer survivors has increased, chronic sequelae of breast cancer radiotherapy become more important. While recently published data suggest a potential for an increase in cardiac events with radiotherapy, these studies do not consider the impact of newer radiotherapy techniques commonly utilized. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to evaluate cardiac dose sparing techniques in breast cancer radiotherapy. Current options for cardiac protection/avoidance include (1) maneuvers that displace the heart from the field such as coordinating the breathing cycle or through prone patient positioning, (2) technological advances such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or proton beam therapy (PBT), and (3) techniques that treat a smaller volume around the lumpectomy cavity such as accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), or intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT). While these techniques have shown promise dosimetrically, limited data on late cardiac events exist due to the difficulties of long-term follow up. Future studies are required to validate the efficacy of cardiac dose sparing techniques and may use surrogates for cardiac events such as biomarkers or perfusion imaging.

Materials and Methods Data for this analysis came from 2 phase III trials: the TARGIT (Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial and the ELIOT (Electron Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial. Cost analyses included a cost-minimization analysis and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis including a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) analysis. Cost analyses were performed comparing IORT with WBI delivered using 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), APBI 3D-CRT, APBI delivered with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), APBI single-lumen (SL), APBI multilumen (ML), and APBI interstitial (I). Results Per 1000 patients treated, the cost savings with IORT were $3.6-$4.3 million, $1.6-$2.4 million, $3.6-$4.4 million, $7.5-$8.2 million, and $2.8-$3.6 million compared with WBI 3D-CRT, APBI IMRT, APBI SL, APBI ML, and APBI I, respectively, with a cost decrement of $1.6- $2.4 million compared with APBI 3D-CRT based on data from the TARGIT trial. The costs per QALY for WBI 3D-CRT, APBI IMRT, APBI SL, APBI ML, and APBI I compared with IORT were $47,990-$60,002; $17,335- $29,347; $49,019-$61,031; $108,162-$120,173; and $36,129-$48,141, respectively, based on data from the ELIOT trial. These results are consistent with APBI and WBI being cost-effective compared with IORT. Conclusion Based on cost-minimization analyses, IORT represents a potential cost savings in the management of early-stage breast cancer. However, absolute reimbursement is misleading, because when additional medical and nonmedical costs associated with IORT are factored in, WBI and APBI represent cost-effective modalities based on cost-per-QALY analyses.

Currently, most women with newly diagnosed DCIS are eligible for breast conserving therapy (BCT); however, significant controversy exists regarding whether or not to add radiation treatment (RT) after surgical excision in low-risk patients. Results: While four older prospective randomized clinical trials have shown that the addition of RT after lumpectomy reduces the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) by approximately 50 %, recent studies have continued to attempt to identify a subset of patients with favorable risk DCIS who are at a sufficiently low-risk of IBTR that omitting RT might be reasonable. While a number of smaller studies have shown promising results, recent prospective data have consistently affirmed the increased risk of IBTR with the omission of RT, with no subset of patients consistently identified that can be safely observed without RT. While radiation after lumpectomy remains the standard of care,"" even in these low-risk patients, future directions include improvements in genetic assays to better identify low-risk patients and new RT techniques and schedules that can potentially reduce the duration of therapy and toxicity while improving quality of life for patients. Conclusion: Based on the data available, we continue to recommend radiation therapy for low-risk patients with DCIS as no discernible subset has been identified that does not benefit from radiation therapy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.""",,0

MATERIALS/METHODS: Four hundred fifty-three patients were treated with APBI using either 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT, n=207) or balloon-based brachytherapy (BB) [single-lumen (SL, n=161) and multilumen (ML, n=85)] between March 2000 and October 2011. To evaluate cost-effectiveness, reimbursement by treatment technique was calculated based on 2011 Medicare schedules. Facility costs were generated by technique based on ICD-9 codes. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER), which compares cost with clinical outcomes, were calculated according to the difference in reimbursement to the criteria being evaluated. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.6 years, the 5-year rate of local recurrence was 1.9% for all patients (3D-CRT, 0%; BB, 4.1%; P=0.23). When pooled, BB patients had a significant improvement in excellent/good cosmesis (91.6% vs. 80.0%; P=0.03). Rates of combined grade 2 or higher dermatitis, hyper/hypopigmentation, pain, or fibrosis per technique were 62%, 28%, and 34% for 3D-CRT, SL, and ML patients, respectively (P=0.26). The ICER per percent improved cosmesis for SL/ML was $519/$850 based on reimbursement and $301/$643 based on cost compared with 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of ICER, brachytherapy for APBI is a cost-effective option with regard to cosmesis and toxicity. This economic analysis suggests the increased cost of applicator-based brachytherapy may be justified in appropriately selected patients.",eng,0

Patients were required to have known chemotherapy and hormonal treatment information (n = 16,128). The only histologies included in this analysis were ductal, lobular, and medullary carcinomas (n = 16,053). Patients included were required to have initial staging and data on follow up available (n = 3593). In matching invasive patients with APBI to those with WBI with respect to their baseline variables, we used the propensity scoring algorithm. Therefore, for each patient treated with APBI or WBI, we calculated the propensity score using the logistic regression model with the baseline characteristics as explanatory variables. For each computed propensity score for patients with APBI, we selected a match from the WBI group based on the closest absolute propensity score-the nearest neighbor"" Rates of regional recurrence (RR) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed for each group and in order to eliminate differences in patient characteristics a matched pair analysis was performed based on age, receipt of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, nodal status, and tumor size. Results: Following the match, no differences in patient characteristics were noted. No differences in the rates of regional recurrence rates or overall survival were noted between WBI and APBI prior to matching and following matching at five years. Cox regression model found no difference between WBI and APBI with regards to regional recurrence; however, overall survival was improved in the APBI cohort (HR 0.008, P < 0.0001). Conclusions: With the largest patient population to date comparing WBI and APBI, no differences in regional recurrence or survival were noted between WBI and APBI treatment. Until the publication of prospective Phase III trials, this data supports the continued use of APBI on and off protocol.""",,0

Vicini,2012.0,Clinical outcomes using accelerated partial breast irradiation in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ,10.1016/j.clbc.2012.04.006,"BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on the use of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate clinical outcomes after APBI in patients with DCIS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 2002 and December 2010, 99 patients with DCIS underwent APBI as part of their breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Partial breast irradiation techniques included interstitial brachytherapy, balloon-based brachytherapy, and 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Clinical outcomes including local recurrence, regional recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Mean follow up was 3.0 years, with a mean patient age of 61.8 years. At 5 years, the rates of local recurrence and regional recurrence were 1.4% and 0%, respectively. Overall survival was 94%, whereas cause-specific survival was 100%. No difference was noted in local control for each treatment technique. When comparing rates using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E-5194 trial groupings, the rate of local recurrence in our cohort was 2.0% for patients with grade I/II disease < 2.5 cm and 0% for grade III < 1.0 cm, representing a 50% and 100% decrease, respectively, in local recurrence compared with excision alone. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DCIS treated with APBI had excellent clinical outcomes regardless of the APBI technique used. Until the publication of prospective phase III trials, these data confirm previous reports highlighting the efficacy of APBI in the treatment of noninvasive carcinoma of the breast.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: One thousand four hundred forty-nine cases of early-stage breast cancer underwent breast-conserving therapy with a single-lumen balloon-based applicator used to deliver adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation (34Gy in 10, bid fractions). One thousand two hundred fifty-five cases (87%) had invasive breast cancer (median size=10mm) and 194 cases (13%) had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; median size=8mm). RESULTS: Patients were stratified by margin status into negative (n=1326), close (<2mm; n=110), and positive (n=13) margins. One hundred twenty-three cases (8.5%) had close or positive margins. Overall, no statistical difference in the 6-year rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) was noted for close margins compared with that of margin-negative patients (8.7% vs. 4.1%, p=0.10) or for positive margins compared with that of margin-negative patients (14.3% vs. 4.1%, p=0.41). In patients with DCIS, there was a statistically significant increase in IBTR with close margins (17.6% vs. 4.2%, p=0.004) and when close and positive margins were pooled (15.7% vs. 4.2%, p=0.01 with a nonsignificant reduction in disease-free survival for DCIS patients with close margins (82.4% vs. 90.8%, p=0.12). The increase in IBTR for close and close/positive patients was secondary to statistically significant increases in elsewhere failures rather than true recurrences/marginal misses. CONCLUSION: Nonsignificant increases in the rates of IBTR were noted with close and positive margins for invasive cancer with further data required to validate these findings.",eng,0

Adjuvant radiation therapy remains an essential component of BCT with standard techniques requiring 5-6 weeks. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is a technique developed over the past two decades that enables completion of treatment in one week or less. Review of the expanding literature reveals increasing support for APBI using several techniques, including interstitial brachytherapy, balloon-based brachytherapy, and external beam therapy. Novel treatment strategies, including intraoperative radiation therapy, hypofractionated APBI, and proton therapy, require further results before definitive conclusions can be made.

In the randomized TARGIT trial, late toxicity was not different between patients treated with IORT and external beam radiotherapy. Early toxicity of IORT has not been fully characterized. Methods: IORT with one dose of 20 Gy using the Intrabeam© device has been offered as an alternative to standard treatment as part of a single center prospective single arm trial. Patients over 60 years with clinically node negative, < 2 cm invasive duct carcinomas were eligible. Patients aged 50-60 years, patients with tumors 2-3.5 cm and patients with invasive lobular carcinomas were treated with IORT if they were not candidates for standard treatment. For the present study information regarding complications occurring within the first year after surgery was analyzed. Patients treated between 2006 and 2012 were included in this analysis. Results: 393 patients were treated from 2006 - 2012. 4 were lost to follow up. Median age was 70 years (55-90) and median clinical tumor size was 1.2 cm (5-30). 102 patients (26.2%) had a complication. Infections were most frequent. Misdiagnosis of radiation dermatitis as infection in some cases cannot be excluded. Clinically meaningful seromas occurred in 10.2% of patient and 8.2% had a wound dehiscence, possibly related to rupture of pre-existing seromas. 18 patients (4.6%) had a grade 3 complication. 2 patients (0.5%) had grade 4 radiation induced skin necrosis of small size and both resolved within 4 months. All other complications resolved completely (table 1). Risk factors for complications in this cohort will also be presented. Conclusions: Intra-operative radiotherapy was associated with a relatively high rate of clinically meaningful seromas and wound dehiscence and rare small size skin necrosis. Most complications were mild - moderate. 5% of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 complications, and all resolved completely.

Previous studies have argued that the CTVs generated by these different margins are effectively equivalent. In this study, we use deformable registration to assess the effective CTV treated by balloon brachytherapy on clinically representative 3D-CRT planning images. Methods and Materials: Ten patients previously treated with the MammoSite were studied. Each patient had two computed tomography (CT) scans, one acquired before and one after balloon implantation. In-house deformable registration software was used to deform the MammoSite CTV onto the balloonless CT set. The deformed CTV was validated using anatomical landmarks common to both CT scans. Results: The effective CTV treated by the MammoSite was on average 7% +/- 10% larger and 38% +/- 4% smaller than 3D-CRT CTVs created using uniform expansions of 1 and 1.5 cm, respectively. The average effective CTV margin was 1.0 cm, the same as the actual MammoSite CTV margin. However, the effective CTV margin was nonuniform and could range from 5 to 15 mm in any given direction. Effective margins <1 cm were attributable to poor cavity-balloon conformance. Balloon size relative to the cavity did not significantly correlate with the effective margin. Conclusion: In this study, the 1.0-cm MammoSite CTV margin treated an effective volume that was significantly smaller than the 3D-CRT CTV based on a 1.5-cm margin. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with early stage breast cancer underwent conventional orthogonal radiograph and computed tomography to generate dosimetric data. Catheter reconstruction and delineation of the lumpectomy cavity, the planning target volume (PTV) and the ipsilateral breast were carried out on computed tomography images. For each patient, geometrically optimised plans (P(xray) and P(CT)) were generated using the active loading length based on the PTV defined from radiographs (PTV(xray)) and computed tomography (PTV(CT)). The plan P(CT) was further optimised graphically and yielded P(graphical). Plans were compared using the coverage index (CI), the external volume index (EI), the dose homogeneity index (DHI), the overdose volume index (OI) and the conformal index (COIN). RESULTS: The mean CI of the lumpectomy cavity estimated from P(xray), P(CT) and P(graphical) was 0.80, 0.82 and 0.92, respectively. The corresponding values for PTV(CT) were 0.69, 0.71 and 0.85. P(graphical) showed an increase in CI by 23 and 19% with respect to P(xray) and P(CT) (P<0.001 in all) with a decrease in DHI from 0.81 to 0.71 (P<0.001) and increase in OI from 0.041 to 0.087 (P<0.001). The EI was highest in P(xray) (mean 44 cm(3)) as compared with 25 cm(3) in P(CT) and 30 cm(3) in P(graphical). A significant improvement in COIN was observed in P(graphical) (mean 0.68) compared with P(xray) (0.48) and P(CT) (0.58) (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Objective dosimetric evaluation on three-dimensional computed tomography confirms its superiority over conventional two-dimensional radiograph-based planning in terms of a reduction in normal breast irradiated with the prescription dose and improvement in conformity. Interactive graphical optimisation based on the target volume in computed tomography further improves conformity with a reduction in dose homogeneity. The use of dose volume indices allows the comparison of different plans and can be used as a tool to correlate dosimetric with clinical outcome.",eng,0

The prescription dose and delivery schema of the electronic brachytherapy APBI plan are the same as the Ir-192 plan. However, due to its lower mean energy than the Ir-192 source, an EBS plan has dosimetric and biological features different from an Ir-192 source plan. Current brachytherapy treatment planning methods may have large errors in treatment outcome prediction for an EBS plan. Two main factors contribute to the errors: the dosimetric influence of tissue heterogeneities and the enhancement of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of electronic brachytherapy. This study quantified the effects of these two factors and revisited the plan quality of electronic brachytherapy APBI. The influence of tissue heterogeneities is studied by a Monte Carlo method and heterogeneous 'virtual patient' phantoms created from CT images and structure contours; the effect of RBE enhancement in the treatment outcome was estimated by biologically effective dose (BED) distribution. Ten electronic brachytherapy APBI cases were studied. The results showed that, for electronic brachytherapy cases, tissue heterogeneities and patient boundary effect decreased dose to the target and skin but increased dose to the bones. On average, the target dose coverage PTV V(100) reduced from 95.0% in water phantoms (planned) to only 66.7% in virtual patient phantoms (actual). The actual maximum dose to the ribs is 3.3 times higher than the planned dose; the actual mean dose to the ipsilateral breast and maximum dose to the skin were reduced by 22% and 17%, respectively. Combining the effect of tissue heterogeneities and RBE enhancement, BED coverage of the target was 89.9% in virtual patient phantoms with RBE enhancement (actual BED) as compared to 95.2% in water phantoms without RBE enhancement (planned BED). About 10% increase in the source output is required to raise BED PTV V(100) to 95%. As a conclusion, the composite effect of dose reduction in the target due to heterogeneities and RBE enhancement results in a net effect of 5.3% target BED coverage loss for electronic brachytherapy. Therefore, it is suggested that about 10% increase in the source output may be necessary to achieve sufficient target coverage higher than 95%.",,0

However, partial shielding does not fully explore the potential of IMBT. The goal of this study is to introduce the concept of three dimensional (3D) intensity modulated brachytherapy and solve two fundamental issues regarding the application of 3D IMBT treatment planning: The dose calculation algorithm and the inverse treatment planning method. Methods: A 3D IMBT treatment planning system prototype was developed using the MATLAB platform. This system consists of three major components: (1) A comprehensive IMBT source calibration method with dosimetric inputs from Monte Carlo (EGSnrc) simulations; (2) a modified TG-43"" (mTG-43) dose calculation formalism for IMBT dosimetry; and (3) a physical constraint based inverse IMBT treatment planning platform utilizing a simulated annealing optimization algorithm. The model S700 Axxent electronic brachytherapy source developed by Xoft, Inc. (Fremont, CA), was simulated in this application. Ten intracavitary accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) cases were studied. For each case, an ""isotropic plan"" with only optimized source dwell time and a fully optimized IMBT plan were generated and compared to the original plan in various dosimetric aspects, such as the plan quality, planning, and delivery time. The issue of the mechanical complexity of the IMBT applicator is not addressed in this study. Results: IMBT approaches showed superior plan quality compared to the original plans and the isotropic plans to different extents in all studied cases. An extremely difficult case with a small breast and a small distance to the ribs and skin, the IMBT plan minimized the high dose volume V200 by 16.1% and 4.8%, respectively, compared to the original and the isotropic plans. The conformity index for the target was increased by 0.13 and 0.04, respectively. The maximum dose to the skin was reduced by 56 and 28 cGy, respectively, per fraction. Also, the maximum dose to the ribs was reduced by 104 and 96 cGy, respectively, per fraction. The mean dose to the ipsilateral and contralateral breasts and lungs were also slightly reduced by the IMBT plan. The limitations of IMBT are the longer planning and delivery time. The IMBT plan took around 2 h to optimize, while the isotropic plan optimization could reach the global minimum within 5 min. The delivery time for the IMBT plan is typically four to six times longer than the corresponding isotropic plan. Conclusions: In this study, a dosimetry method for IMBT sources was proposed and an inverse treatment planning system prototype for IMBT was developed. The improvement of plan quality by 3D IMBT was demonstrated using ten APBI case studies. Faster computers and higher output of the source can further reduce plan optimization and delivery time, respectively. © 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.""",,0

The estimate of the standardized incidence ratio is 1.2, increasing with time elapsed from irradiation, and influenced by age, genetic and environmental backgrounds of the patient and systemic treatments. The majority of SRIC occurs in or close to high-dose treatment volume in the intermediate dose level. It is a dose- and rate-dependent phenomenon that rarely occurs in tissues with a cumulative dose of <3.5. Gy. Careful patient selection, thorough treatment planning and modern radiation equipment can reduce the dose to the surrounding tissues and decrease the incidence of SRIC. © 2011.",,0

Smith,2016.0,Trends in Local Therapy Utilization and Cost for Early-Stage Breast Cancer in Older Women: Implications for Payment and Policy Reform,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.01.059,"PURPOSE: Older women with early-stage disease constitute the most rapidly growing breast cancer demographic, yet it is not known which local therapy strategies are most favored by this population in the current era. Understanding utilization trends and cost of local therapy is important for informing the design of bundled payment models as payers migrate away from fee-for-service models. We therefore used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare database to determine patterns of care and costs for local therapy among older women with breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatment strategy and covariables were determined in 55,327 women age >/=66 with Tis-T2N0-1M0 breast cancer who underwent local therapy between 2000 and 2008. Trends in local therapy were characterized using Joinpoint. Polychotomous logistic regression determined predictors of local therapy. The median aggregate cost over the first 24 months after diagnosis was determined from Medicare claims through 2010 and reported in 2014 dollars. RESULTS: The median age was 75. Local therapy distribution was as follows: 27,896 (50.3%) lumpectomy with external beam radiation, 18,356 (33.1%) mastectomy alone, 6159 (11.1%) lumpectomy alone, 1488 (2.7%) mastectomy with reconstruction, and 1455 (2.6%) lumpectomy with brachytherapy. Mastectomy alone declined from 39.0% in 2000 to 28.2% in 2008, and the use of breast conserving local therapies rose from 58.7% to 68.2%. Mastectomy with reconstruction was more common among the youngest, healthiest patients, whereas mastectomy alone was more common among patients living in rural low-income regions. By 2008, the costs were $36,749 for lumpectomy with brachytherapy, $35,030 for mastectomy with reconstruction, $31,388 for lumpectomy with external beam radiation, $21,993 for mastectomy alone, and $19,287 for lumpectomy alone. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mastectomy alone in older women declined in favor of breast conserving strategies between 2000 and 2008. Using these cost estimates, price points for local therapy bundles can be constructed to incentivize the treatment strategies that confer the highest value.",eng,0

One way to perform IORT is to use an existing linac and modify the treatment head using an applicator system. In this study the objectives were to design, and build an in-house IORT applicator system, perform an acquisition of dosimetry data and characterize the IORT radiation parameters. Materials and Methods: IORT applicator system developed in this research consists of three flat applicators with inner diameters (f{cyrillic}) of 3, 5 and 9 cm and one tube (f{cyrillic} =3 cm) with a 45-degree beveled end. Beam characteristics evaluated include percent depth dose distributions, beam profiles, and leakage dose distributions. Measurements were performed using a Scanditronix (p-si) diode field detector in a Scanditronix (RFAplus) 3-D water phantom. Results: Compared to the standard applicator, depth dose curves for intra-operative cones are shallower; surface dose is higher and the maximum peripheral dose is in the order of 9.6%. Conclusion: Using a 10 MeV electron beam, the cone system developed in this study is suitable for treating tumors of width and depth ranges of 1.9-8.4 cm and 14-29 mm, respectively.",,0

Bacterial strikethrough of draping and gown material is a likely source of infection. Strategies to reduce infection in implant-based breast reconstruction are essential to improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if a disposable draping system is superior to reusable draping materials in the prevention of implant-based breast reconstruction infection. METHODS: This single-institution, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, IRB-approved study enrolled women with breast cancer who were eligible for implant-based breast reconstruction. The primary endpoint was clinical infection by postoperative day 30. Secondary endpoints included all other complications encountered throughout the follow-up period and culture data. Demographic data recorded included patient age, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, chemotherapy, radiation, and follow-up. Procedural data recorded included procedure type, procedure length, estimated blood loss, use of acellular dermal matrix, use of muscle flap, and inpatient versus outpatient setting. RESULTS: From March 2010 through January 2012, 107 women were randomized and 102 completed the study. Five patients were determined not to be candidates for reconstruction after randomization. There were 43 patients in the Reusable Group and 59 patients in the Disposable Group. There were no significant differences in patient demographic data, procedural data, or the type of procedure performed between groups. In the Reusable Group, there were 5 infections (12%) within 30 days compared to 0 (0%) infections in the Disposable Group (P = 0.012). There was no significant difference in secondary complications. There was a trend for positive wound cultures (11% vs. 3%, P = 0.10) and positive drape cultures (17% vs.4%, P = 0.08) in patients with clinical infection. There were no differences in the number of colony-forming units or positive cultures between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Disposable draping material is superior to a reusable draping system in the prevention of clinical infection within the immediate postoperative period. This study did not demonstrate a clear link between intraoperative culture data and the development of clinical infection. A completely disposable gown and draping system is recommended during implant-based breast reconstruction.",eng,0

We pioneered a novel method of IORT that incorporates customized, computed tomography (CT)-based treatment planning and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy to overcome these drawbacks: CT-HDR-IORT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A phase 1 study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of CT-HDR-IORT. Eligibility criteria included age >/=50 years, invasive or in situ breast cancer, tumor size <3 cm, and N0 disease. Patients were eligible before or within 30 days of breast-conserving surgery (BCS). BCS was performed, and a multilumen balloon catheter was placed. CT images were obtained, a customized HDR brachytherapy plan was created, and a dose of 12.5 Gy was delivered to 1-cm depth from the balloon surface. The catheter was removed, and the skin was closed. The primary endpoints were feasibility and acute toxicity. Feasibility was defined as IORT treatment interval (time from CT acquisition until IORT completion) </=90 minutes. The secondary endpoints included dosimetry, cosmetic outcome, quality of life, and late toxicity. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled. The 6-month follow-up assessments were completed by 93% of enrollees. The median IORT treatment interval was 67.2 minutes (range, 50-108 minutes). The treatment met feasibility criteria in 26 women (93%). The dosimetric goals were met in 22 patients (79%). There were no Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3+ toxicities; 6 patients (21%) experienced grade 2 events. Most patients (93%) had good/excellent cosmetic outcomes at the last follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: CT-HDR-IORT is feasible and safe. This promising approach for a conformal, image-based, higher-dose breast IORT is being evaluated in a phase 2 trial.",eng,0

As initial treatment often employs the use of radiation therapy (RT), the standard of care for local breast cancer recurrence after initial breast conserving therapy has traditionally been surgical intervention with mastectomy. However, recent attempts to preserve the intact breast after recurrence with local excision have revealed a potential need for RT in addition to repeat breast conserving surgery as rates of local failure with resection alone remain high. Additionally, local recurrence following initial mastectomy and chest wall RT can be treated with reirradiation to increase local control. Repeating RT, however, in a previously irradiated area, is a complex treatment strategy, as the clinician must carefully balance maximizing treatment effectiveness while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. As a result, physicians have been hesitant to treat recurrent disease with repeat RT with limited data. Results from the current literature are promising and current clinical trials are underway to explore reirradiation modalities which will provide additional information on treatment-related toxicity and outcomes. This paper will review the current literature on repeat radiation therapy for locally recurrent breast cancer. © 2012 Joshua Siglin et al.",,0

A single dose of 20 Gy administered to the tumor bed may cause significant post surgery changes in breast tissues. These changes could complicate the breast post radiotherapy radiologic imaging and lead to additive diagnostic procedures Methods: We analyzed the first consecutive 100 patients treated who underwent at least three mammography studies during the follow up period (approximately 6, 12 and 18 months after procedure). We assessed mammography changes, and ultrasound findings, fluid aspirations and trucut biopsies if performed. Results: In 19% of patients the first mammography detected pathologic findings: 12% seroma, 6% microcalcification and in 1% was suspected lesion. In the second mammography, findings were reported in 14% patients: 7% seroma, 6% microcalcifications and 1% suspected tumor. Third mammography detected 11 findings: 5% seroma, 4% microcalcifications, 1% severe fibrosis and 1% suspected tumor. In 29% of patients ultrasound was performed due to palpatory and/or mammographic findings. In 58 of 86 ultrasound images (67%) showed the abnormal findings. The changes were mostly post operative changes and seromas. 4 images (7%) detected suspected lesions. Ultrasound guided fluid aspiration was performed in 8% of patients, all cytological examinations were normal. Imaging guided trucut biopsy was performed in 9% of patients due to imaging finding, only 2 malignant tumors were detected. Conclusion: The alterations in the breast tissue due to single dose of intraoperative radiotherapy cause more mammography findings which lead to much more frequent use of additional investigations.

From 2006 we offer IORT to a well selected population of breast cancer patients. A single dose of 20 Gy is administered to the tumor bed by low energy X-ray generating system (IntraBeam, Zeiss). This relatively high single radiation dose may cause significant and unusual post surgery changes in breast tissue that could complicate the radiologic follow up and lead to additive diagnostic procedures. Methods:We analyzed the first consecutive 300 patients treated by IORT. During median follow up period 56 months (1-96) 38 patients (13%) underwent core biopsy due to clinical or imaging findings in the treated breast. Results: In 12/38 patients (32%) breast tumor recurrence was diagnosed. In 26/38 patients (68%) the pathology showed benign tissue. In this subgroup of 26 patients the reasons for biopsy were ultrasound findings at the lumpectomy scar in 13 (50%) mammography findings (usually calcifications) around the surgical bed in 8 (19%) and clinical palpable masses in 5 patients (19%). The median time between surgery and core biopsy seems to be shorter in patients with mammography findings (25 months, 16-34) than in patients with palpable findings (38 months, 16-51) or ultrasound lesions (69 months, 14-83). This difference is probably due to the fact that post lumpectomy with IORT mammography calcifications represent fat necrosis and appear earlier while ultrasound and palpatory findings represent fibrotic changes which appear later. Conclusion: Single high dose irradiation dose administered to the breast tissue is causing unusual clinical and imaging findings. These findings, which represent benign lesions in 68% of patients, lead to increased need for invasive diagnostic procedures like breast core biopsy.",,0

The goal is to completely excise the cancer, with wide surgical margins while maintaining or improving cosmesis. For large, poorly defined, or unfavorably situated tumors, standard lumpectomies may lead to unacceptable cosmetic results in addition to close or involved resection margins. Similar problems may occur for smaller tumors in small breasts. Integration of the two surgical disciplines avoids or minimizes poor cosmetic results after wide excision. It increases the number of women who can be treated with breast-conserving surgery by allowing larger breast excisions with more acceptable cosmetic results. Oncoplastic surgery requires a multidisciplinary approach and thorough preoperative planning. It is absolutely necessary to enlist the cooperation and coordination of surgical oncology, plastic surgery, radiology, pathology, medical oncology, and radiation oncology. Oncoplastic surgery requires a philosophy that the appearance of the breast after tumor excision is important. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,0

In such circumstances, the selectivity principle must always be respected. In order to prevent unnecessary irradiation of the ribs or the lung, a shield with suitable diameter, thickness and composition can be positioned on the pectoral muscle. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of different treatment parameters on the correct alignment between the shield and the beam. Materials: As soon as the pathological tumor size has been determined, a field diameter and a shield diameter are chosen in the OR. First, the shield is sutured to the pectoral muscle, then the mammary gland to be treated is sutured above the shield and that makes the shield position difficult to assess. Intraoperative electron treatment is performed with a mobile electron accelerator. The treatment parameters are the applicator diameters (available from 3 to 10 cm), the type of applicator tip flat or beveled-, the energies ranging from 4 to 12 MeV, the uses or boluses (none, 5 mm or 10 mm) to modulate the depth of the prescription isodose, the gantry and tilt angles to align the accelerator with the applicator with a laser soft docking system. The alignment between the shield and the field is evaluated with a classical silver film, placed on the beamstopper. The darkening of the film is due to the braking radiation produced by the electron slowing down. Results: 73 films from 72 patients have been processed. When the beam is not perfectly aligned with the shield, a darker eclipse is visible inside the image of the beam. The shield coverage is calculated as the part of the beam surface covered by the shield. The general mean shield coverage is 85% (range: 40-100%). The shield alignment was considered as poor (<60%) in 5 cases (7%), as fair (between 60 and 80 %) in 12 cases (17%), as good (between 80 and 90 %) in 17 cases (23%) and as excellent (>90%) in 39 cases (53%).Nor the shield depth in tissue, nor the energy used, nor the type of applicator tip, nor the use of boluses, nor beam orientation (to see any gravity effect on the shield) seem to have an impact on the mean shield coverage. On the other hand, the shield size does logically matter. We defined the shield margin as the shield diameter minus the beam diameter at the depth of the shield. When the margin is less than 10 mm, the mean shield coverage is 76% (range: 50-98%). When the margin is between 10 and 20 mm, the mean shield coverage is 84% (range: 40-100%). When the margin is larger than 20 mm, the mean shield coverage is 95% (range: 85-100%). Conclusions: In Intraoperative Radiotherapy, a correct shield placement is of great importance to prevent side effects. The shield alignment with the beam can be easily controlled by a plain X-ray film. Even when one takes really care of the shield position, the shield coverage is not always optimum. A margin larger than 10 mm and preferably, if the patient anatomy permits, larger than 20 mm is needed to obtain excellent coverages.",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The novel technology used in this study is a mammography-based, noninvasive breast brachytherapy system whereby the treatment applicators are centered on the planning target volume (PTV) to direct (192)Ir emissions along orthogonal axes. To date, three-dimensional dose modeling of NIIGBB has not been possible because of the limitations of conventional treatment planning systems (TPS) to model variable tissue deformation associated with breast compression. In this study, the TPS was adapted such that the NIIGBB dose distributions were modeled as a virtual point source. This dose calculation technique was applied to CT data from 8 patients imaged with the breast compressed between parallel plates in the cranial-caudal and medial-lateral axes. A dose-volume comparison was performed to simulated electron boost and 3DCRT APBI. RESULTS: The NIIGBB PTV was significantly reduced as compared with both electrons and 3DCRT. Electron boost plans had a lower D(min) than the NIIGBB technique but higher V(100), D(90), and D(50). With regard to PTV coverage for APBI, the only significant differences were minimally higher D(90), D(100), V(80), and V(90), with 3DCRT and D(max) with NIIGBB. The NIIGBB technique, as compared with electrons and 3D-CRT, achieved a lower maximum dose to skin (60% and 10%, respectively) and chest wall/lung (70-90%). CONCLUSIONS: NIIGBB achieves a PTV that is smaller than electron beam and 3DCRT techniques. This results in significant normal tissue sparing while maintaining dosimetric benchmarks to the target tissue.",eng,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Group of 24 patients with multi-lumen balloon applied were investigated. Each patient received 10 fractions of 3.4 Gy (2 fractions daily). For every patient, four treatment plans were prepared. Firstly, for five-lumen balloon optimized with IPSA algorithm and optimization parameters adjusted for each case. Secondly, for the same applicator optimized with dose point optimization and distant option. Two other plans were prepared for single-lumen applicator, created by removing four peripheral lumens, optimized with both algorithms. RESULTS: The highest D95 parameter was obtained for plans optimized with IPSA algorithm, mean value 99.3 percent of prescribed dose, and it was significantly higher than plans optimized with dose point algorithm (mean = 83.50%, p < 0.0001), IPSA single-lumen balloon plan (mean = 83.50%, p = 0.0037) and optimized to dose point single-lumen balloon (mean = 85.51%, p < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences concerning maximum doses distributed to skin surface for neither application nor optimization method. Volumes receiving 200% of prescribed dose in PTV were higher for multi-lumen balloon dose point optimized plans (mean = 8.78%), than for other plans (IPSA multi-lumen balloon plan: mean = 7.37%, p < 0.0001, single-lumen IPSA: mean = 7.20%, p < 0.0001, single-lumen dose point: mean = 7.19%, p < 0.0001).

The standard technique of EBRT after BCS is to treat the whole breast up to a total dose of 42.5 to 50 Gy. An additional dose is given to treated volume as a boost to a portion of the breast. In the early stage of breast cancer, research has shown that the area requiring radiation treatment to prevent the cancer from local recurrence is the breast tissue that surrounds the area where the initial cancer was removed. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an approach that treats only the lumpectomy bed plus a 1-2 cm margin rather than the whole breast and as a result allows accelerated delivery of the radiation dose in four to five days. There has been a growing interest for APBI and various approaches have been developed under phase I-III clinical studies; these include multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, balloon catheter brachytherapy, conformal external beam radiation therapy (3D-EBRT) and intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT). Balloon-based brachytherapy approaches include MammoSite, Axxent electronic brachytherapy, Contura, hybrid brachytherapy devices.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a 40 x 40 x 40 cm(3) water tank, an Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) brachytherapy balloon inflated to 4 cm diameter was situated directly below the center of a 30 x 30 x 1 cm(3) solid water slab. Nine cm of solid water was stacked above the 1 cm base. A parallel plate ion chamber was centered above the base and ionization current measurements were taken from the central HDR source dwell position for channels 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the balloon. Additional ionization data was acquired in the 9 cm stack at 1 cm increments. A comparable data set was also measured after replacing the 9 cm solid water stack with cork slabs. The ratios of measurements in the two phantoms were calculated and compared to predicted results of a commercial treatment planning system. RESULTS: Lower dose was measured in the cork within 1 cm of the cork/solid water interface possibly due to backscatter effects. Higher dose was measured beyond 1 cm from the cork/solid water interface, increasing with path length up to 15% at 9 cm depth in cork. The treatment planning system did not predict either dose effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study investigates the dosimetry of low density material when the breast is treated with Ir-192 brachytherapy. HDR dose from Ir-192 in a cork media is shown to be significantly different than in unit density media. These dose differences are not predicted in most commercial brachytherapy planning systems.

In spinal surgery, intraoperative fluoroscopy is the common method for identification of the level affected. It seldom visualizes the pathology itself and is prone to error in identifying anatomic disorders and superimposing structures. In peripheral nerve surgery, intraoperative fluoroscopy is of little value. The present technical study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using a preoperative computed tomography-guided needle marking system, which was previously developed for use in gynecology. The goal was to reduce intraoperative localization error and radiation exposure to patients and operating room personnel. METHODS: We used a flexible hooked-wire needle marking system, which has previously been used for preoperative marking of breast lesions, to localize and tag spinal and peripheral nerve pathologies. Marking was carried out under computed tomographic control before surgery. Seven illustrative cases were chosen for this report: 6 patients with disorders of the spine and 1 patient with a peripheral nerve schwannoma. RESULTS: No adverse reactions, aside from minor discomfort, were observed in this study. In all cases, the needle could be used as a reliable guide for the surgical approach and led directly to the pathology. In no case was additional intraoperative fluoroscopy needed. The level of radiation exposure to the patient as a result of computed tomography-based marking was similar to or less than that encountered in conventional intraoperative x-ray localization. Radiation exposure to the operating room personnel was eliminated by this method. CONCLUSION: Preoperative marking of spinal level or peripheral nerve pathologies with a flexible hooked-wire needle marking system is feasible and appears to be safe and useful for neurosurgical spinal and peripheral procedures.",eng,0

Background: Conventionally, breast conserving therapy consists of breast conserving surgery followed by postoperative whole breast irradiation and boost. The use of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) enables the boost to be delivered already during the surgery. In this case, the treatment dose for IORT can be calculated by use of General Gaussian Pencil Beam (GGPB) algorithm, which is implemented in TPS Eclipse. Materials and methods: PDDs and OFs for electron beams from Mobetron and all available applicators were measured in order to configure the GGPB algorithm. Afterwards, the irradiation times for the prescribed dose of 3. Gy were calculated by means of it. The results of calculations were verified in the water phantom using the Marcus ionization chamber. Results: The results differed between energies. For 6. MeV the irradiation times calculated by the GGPB algorithm were correct, for the energy of 9. MeV they were too small and for the energy of 4. MeV they were too large for applicators with smaller diameters, while acceptable for the remaining ones. Conclusion: The GGPB algorithm can be used in intraoperative radiotherapy for energy and applicator sets for which no significant difference between the measured and the prescribed dose was obtained. For the rest of energy-applicator sets the configuration should be verified and possibly repeated. © 2010 Greater Poland Cancer Centre, Poland.",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using MarketScan health care claims data, we identified 45,884 invasive breast cancer patients (aged 18-64 years), treated from 2003 to 2010 with lumpectomy, followed by brachytherapy (n = 3134) or whole-breast irradiation (n = 42,750). We stratified patients into risk groups according to age (Age < 50 vs Age >/= 50) and endocrine therapy status (Endocrine- vs Endocrine+). Endocrine+"" patients filled an endocrine therapy prescription within 1 year after lumpectomy. Pathologic hormone receptor status was not available in this dataset. In brachytherapy versus WBI patients, utilization trends and 5-year subsequent mastectomy risks were compared. Stratified, adjusted subsequent mastectomy risks were calculated using proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Brachytherapy utilization increased from 2003 to 2010: in patients Age < 50, from 0.6% to 4.9%; patients Age >/= 50 from 2.2% to 11.3%; Endocrine- patients, 1.3% to 9.4%; Endocrine+ patients, 1.9% to 9.7%.

Recently proposed suitability"" criteria guiding patient selection for brachytherapy have never been empirically validated. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, we compared women aged 66 years or older with invasive breast cancer (n=28,718) or ductal carcinoma in situ (n=7229) diagnosed from 2002 to 2007, treated with lumpectomy alone, brachytherapy, or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). The likelihood of breast preservation, measured by subsequent mastectomy risk, was compared by use of multivariate proportional hazards, further stratified by American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) brachytherapy suitability groups. We compared 1-year postoperative complications using the chi(2) test and 5-year local toxicities using the log-rank test. RESULTS: For patients with invasive cancer, the 5-year subsequent mastectomy risk was 4.7% after lumpectomy alone (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1%-5.4%), 2.8% after brachytherapy (95% CI, 1.8%-4.3%), and 1.3% after EBRT (95% CI, 1.1%-1.5%) (P<.001). Compared with lumpectomy alone, brachytherapy achieved a more modest reduction in adjusted risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.94) than achieved with EBRT (HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.18-0.28). Relative risks did not differ when stratified by ASTRO suitability group (P=.84 for interaction), although ASTRO ""suitable"" patients did show a low absolute subsequent mastectomy risk, with a minimal absolute difference in risk after brachytherapy (1.6%; 95% CI, 0.7%-3.5%) versus EBRT (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.6%-1.1%). For patients with ductal carcinoma in situ, EBRT maintained a reduced risk of subsequent mastectomy (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.28-0.55; P<.001), whereas the small number of patients treated with brachytherapy (n=179) precluded definitive comparison with lumpectomy alone. In all patients, brachytherapy showed a higher postoperative infection risk (16.5% vs 9.9% after lumpectomy alone vs 11.4% after EBRT, P<.001); higher incidence of breast pain (22.9% vs 11.2% vs 16.7%, P<.001); and higher incidence of fat necrosis (15.3% vs 5.3% vs 7.7%, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study era, brachytherapy showed lesser breast preservation benefit compared with EBRT. Suitability criteria predicted differential absolute, but not relative, benefit in patients with invasive cancer.""",eng,0

We sought to determine how frequently current treatment meets quality benchmarks and whether new technologies have influenced patterns of care. METHODS AND MATERIALS: By searching diagnosis and procedure claims in MarketScan, an employment-based health care claims database, we identified 1508 patients with nonmetastatic, intact cervical cancer treated from 1999 to 2011, who were <65 years of age and received >10 fractions of radiation. Treatments received were identified using procedure codes and compared with 3 quality benchmarks: receipt of brachytherapy, receipt of chemotherapy, and radiation treatment duration not exceeding 63 days. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to evaluate temporal trends. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of patients (n=1182) received brachytherapy, with brachytherapy receipt stable over time (Cochran-Armitage Ptrend=.15). Among patients who received brachytherapy, 66% had high-dose rate and 34% had low-dose rate treatment, although use of high-dose rate brachytherapy steadily increased to 75% by 2011 (Ptrend<.001). Eighteen percent of patients (n=278) received intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and IMRT receipt increased to 37% by 2011 (Ptrend<.001). Only 2.5% of patients (n=38) received IMRT in the setting of brachytherapy omission. Overall, 79% of patients (n=1185) received chemotherapy, and chemotherapy receipt increased to 84% by 2011 (Ptrend<.001). Median radiation treatment duration was 56 days (interquartile range, 47-65 days); however, duration exceeded 63 days in 36% of patients (n=543). Although 98% of patients received at least 1 benchmark treatment, only 44% received treatment that met all 3 benchmarks. With more stringent indicators (brachytherapy, >/=4 chemotherapy cycles, and duration not exceeding 56 days), only 25% of patients received treatment that met all benchmarks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred and thirty five patients who underwent breast conserving therapy for stage I/II cancer from 1971 to 1996 were included in this IRB-approved retrospective analysis. Three hundred and ninety five patients had a defined inked margin status after initial excision. The following factors were evaluated for correlation with margins at initial excision: age (< or >45), grade (3/1 or 2), family history (present/absent), histology (lobular/other), estrogen receptor (ER) status, presence of extensive intraductal carcinoma (EIC), presence of lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and biopsy type (excisional/preoperative). RESULTS: Biopsy type (P < 0.0001), EIC (P = 0.002), ER status (P = 0.02), lobular histology (P = 0.02) and age (P = 0.02) were significantly correlated with initial margin status among the entire group. For patients who underwent preoperative diagnostic biopsy, 52% (35/67) had negative initial margins as compared to 29% (94/328) for excisional biopsy. Among patients who underwent preoperative biopsy, only lobular histology (P = 0.04) and LVI (P = 0.04) were related to initial margin status. The rate of re-excision was 34% for patients diagnosed preoperatively versus 61% with excisional biopsy (P < 0.0001). The percentage of patients with negative final margin status was similar with either core/needle or excisional biopsy (79 and 78%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative diagnosis is the most significant predictor of initial margin status in patients undergoing breast conservation. Patients with lobular histology may require improved preoperative and/or intraoperative assessment to increase the rate of negative margins at initial excision.",eng,0

Journal Article,M. Sokolov,2013.0,"Surgical approach in locally advanced colorectal cancer--combined, extended and compound surgery",", ","Cancer of the colon and rectum (colorectal cancer - CRC) is ranked second in prevalence--the men he is after lung cancer, and for women--after breast cancer. There is a steady trend to annual increase in incidence in the country. Definition of locally advanced disease is necessary in order to achieve practical and theoretical clarity regarding not a small percentage of patients with colorectal cancer presenting for treatment to the surgeon. As for the primary and the recurrent locally advanced tumors, postoperative long-term survival is achievable, but only after complete R0-resection. AIM: The objective of the presented literature review is to analyze data from a number of internationally published studies looking multifactorial variety of problems in the primary and recurrent locally advanced colorectal cancer (LAKRK) capable of optimizing behavior in surgical patients with this frequently encountered oncological and social significant pathology. Aim The objective of the presented literature review is to analyze data from a number of internationally published studies looking multifactor variety of problems in the primary and recurrent locally advanced colorectal cancer (LACRC) capable of optimizing behavior in surgical patients with this frequently encountered oncologic and social significant pathology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, critical and comparatively examined published in the world literature review papers, case reports and clinical studies dealing with locally advanced primary and recurrent cancer that goes beyond the colon and rectum involving the surrounding structures and organs with the requirements for individualized Team"" approach of preoperative and intraoperative staging, planning and execution of multivisceral ""en-block"" resection with typical technical difficulties, complications and results. RESULTS: As ""locally advanced"" tumors represent 5-22% of all colorectal carcinomas. According to the analyzed data in patients with tumor stage IIB, which extend through the intestinal wall and infiltrated the surrounding structures without lymph node metastases (T4 N0 M0) have a worse chance of survival than those with tumors in stage III, which remain within the intestinal wall, but had spread to the lymph nodes (T1 - 2 N1 - 2). Recent studies confirm that T4 stage is an important independent predictor of disease-free interval and overall survival. Discussed are the terms "" combined"", ""extended"" and ""compound"" surgery. Describe the importance of dissection in lymphnodes in LACRC through related analogue of total mesorectal excision in rectal cancer excision in complete mesocolic excision location in the colon. Discussed are ways of locally advanced primary tumors and recurrences with different types of loco - regional involvement of surrounding structures and organs. Describe in detail the operational- tactical and technical aspects of the block R0- resection in primary and recurrent LAKRK with type and severity of any complications and treatment outcomes. Concerns the importance of an integrated approach with neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Justified the opinion of the adequate, in particular disease, reasonably aggressive pattern to LACRC securing the most favorable long-term survival prognosis.""","bul

Farrus,2014.0,The role of radiotherapy technicians in intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons in a dedicated operating room,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed16&AN=71890772","Purpose/Objective: Determine the advantages of intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (ELIOT) with a mobile linear accelerator (SORDINA) in a specialized operating room (OR) from the Radiotherapy Technicians (RTT) point of view. The availability of an OR exclusively for ELIOT has a series of advantages including perfect knowledge of the space available and for training prior to the intervention. Materials and Methods: ELIOT has been performed in patients with breast cancer in our hospital since July 2013. In addition to the multidisciplinary surgical staff, 2 RTTs (sterile and circulating) are required. The technical team is made up of 5 professionals in continuous rotation following an established schedule. Training is undertaken the day prior to each procedure. A database was created for intervention registry including the reporting of the times of action, the grades of pitch and roll, gantry height, applicator diameter and of the disc protector, as well as the dose, energy and irradiation time. The surgical team calls radiotherapy when the surgical piece is to be analyzed. From this time the OR is available for half an hour to perform the selection of the material to be used and placement of the portable accelerator in the zone next to the operating table. When doing the docking of the applicators it is very important that only one technician directs the operation, obliging the remaining personnel to be silent or outside the OR. Results: Since the same RTTs do the interventions, group functioning and communication is very important. Training done on the days prior to each intervention facilitates apparatus control and technical skill, particularly in difficult localizations. The availability of the OR besides External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) room allows displacement of the technicians to the OR in less than 5 minutes and thus, they can wait until the last minute before entering, allowing them to continue with their usual activity. The overall time of the RTTs in the OR is about 20 to 35 minutes, having reduced the docking time since the first interventions from 10-13 minutes to 5-8 minutes. Conclusions: The availability of a specialized OR next to the EBRT room allows prompt entry at the time of ELIOT and also facilitates previous training. It is important to maintain good communication with the radiation oncologist since previous knowledge of the localization of the surgical bed allows the work to be undertaken with greater safety, skill and efficacy, thereby minimizing the time of action.",,0

Materials and methods: A bibliometric search was conducted for IORT papers published in the PubMed database between 1997 and 2013. Publication rate was used as a quantity indicator; the 2012 Science Citation Index Impact Factor as a quality indicator. Furthermore, the publications were stratified in terms of study type, scientific topic reported, year of publication, tumor type and journal specialty. We performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine differences between the means of the analyzed groups. Results: Among the total of 207 journals, articles were reported significantly more frequently in surgery (n = 399, 41 %) and radiotherapy journals (n = 273, 28 %; p < 0.01). The highest impact factor was achieved by clinical oncology journals (p < 0.01). The majority of identified articles were retrospective cohort reports (n = 622, 64 %), followed by review articles (n = 204, 21 %; p < 0.001). Regarding primary topic, reports on cancer outcome following specific tumor therapy were most frequently published (n = 661, 68 %; p < 0.001) and gained the highest mean impact factor (p < 0.01). Gastrointestinal tumor reports were represented most frequently (n = 456, 47 %; p < 0.001) and the mean superior impact factor was earned by breast and gynecologic publications (p < 0.01). Conclusion: We identified a consistent and sustained scientific productivity of international IORT expert groups. Most publications appeared in journals with surgical and radiooncological content.

The fractionation sensitivities of normal and malignant tissues over this range of fraction sizes are not expected to change when hypofractionation is used for partial breast radiotherapy (PBRT), at least when once-daily fractions are delivered. When twice-daily fractions of the same size are used, a greater effect of the second fraction must be taken into account when using iso-effect formulae, such as the linear-quadratic model. The magnitude of this effect is better quantified for normal tissues than for tumours. The clinicaltolerance of late adverse effects after a PBRT schedule, whether hypofractionated or not, may be greater than after the same schedule delivered to the whole breast, even if tissue damage per unit volume is the same. For example, a given density of fibrosis restricted to a partial (eg. boost) volume may be better tolerated than the same density of fibrosis affecting the whole breast. Overall treatment time is not expected to impact on late adverse effects, other than by modifying the severity of effects consequential to acute skin reactions. An impact of treatment time on tumour control in the adjuvant setting has not been formally tested, but cannot be ruled out. Finally, it is likely that the clinical effects of current single dose intraoperative radiotherapy schedules remain explicable in terms of current models of tumour and normal tissue responses.",,0
Journal Article,M. Sood; P. Glat,2013.0,Potential of the SPY intraoperative perfusion assessment system to reduce ischemic complications in immediate postmastectomy breast reconstruction,10.1186/1750-1164-7-9,"BACKGROUND: The quality and viability of mastectomy flaps remain a central challenge in reconstructive surgery, particularly for immediate breast reconstruction. Insufficient perfusion in tissue flaps is a leading cause of early complications following reconstructive procedures, and clinical judgment alone is not completely reliable for the assessment of flap viability. Accurate and reliable intraoperative methods for assessment of tissue perfusion are needed to help surgeons identify tissue at risk for ischemia and necrosis, thereby allowing for maneuvers to improve tissue flap viability. METHODS: This study evaluates the use of intraoperative laser angiography using the SPY System (LifeCell Corp., Branchburg, NJ) for the assessment of perfusion in mastectomy flaps for immediate breast reconstruction. The SPY System uses the contrast agent indocyanine green, which has an excellent safety profile and pharmacokinetics that allow for repeat evaluations during the same surgical procedure. In recent work, the SPY System has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detection of tissues at risk for ischemia and necrosis during reconstructive surgery. Using a retrospective, chart-review design, the authors compared consecutive cases of immediate breast reconstruction using a prosthesis, before and after implementation of the SPY System. RESULTS: Ninety-one subjects were included in the analysis: 52 prior to SPY (Pre-SPY) and 39 after implementation of SPY (Post-SPY). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Both groups had high rates of comorbidities, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The rate of postoperative complications was two-fold higher in the Pre-SPY group compared to the Post-SPY group (36.5% vs. 17.9%); this difference was of borderline significance (P = 0.0631). However, mean number of repeat visits to the OR per patient was significantly higher in the Pre-SPY group (1.21 +/- 1.47 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.71; P = 0.0023). Of the seven patients with complications in the Post-SPY group, five were identified by SPY as having poor flap perfusion; none were identified by clinical judgment alone. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the SPY System can contribute to reduced ischemia-related complications in a population of women undergoing immediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer.",eng,0

We report early complications of both techniques. METHODS: A total of 125 patients underwent catheter placement for MammoSite high-dose rate brachytherapy, with 108 patients successfully completing treatment. The OT was used in 85 patients and PCT in 40 patients. The mean distance between the balloon surface and breast skin was 1.44 cm and 1.31 cm, respectively. Average skin dose was 278 cGy in the OT group and 295 cGy in the PCT group (P > 0.05). Average gross specimen size was 43.16 cm3 in the OT group and 62.19 cm3 in the PCT group. Median follow-up was 11 months for the OT group and 5 months for the PCT group. RESULTS: In 17 cases, the catheter was subsequently removed without the patient completing treatment. Two of the patients in the OT group (3%) developed a delayed abscess. The overall incidence of persistent seroma (>6 months) was 20% with all occurring in the OT group, 30% of those patients. There were no acute skin toxicities higher than grade 2. The overall cosmesis is excellent or good in 95% of patients. CONCLUSION: Despite short follow-up and a small sample size in this study, it seems that the MammoSite brachytherapy was well tolerated by patients with early stage breast cancer when using either the OT or PCT.",eng,0

This work introduces an objective system to document the breast cosmetic changes using nonstandardized photographs without scale calibration. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred twenty-eight photographs of 114 breast cancer patients were analyzed. Baseline photographs were taken after breast-conservation surgery and before partial breast irradiation. Further photographs were taken during followup. The photographs were taken with a frontal view of the patient and without any skin marks for scaling. The baseline and the last followup photographs were analyzed by measuring certain anatomic distances (representing the nipple displacement and the asymmetry in breast dimensions and contour) to calculate the objective breast cosmesis score (OBCS). The measurements represent the nipple displacement and the asymmetry in breast dimensions and contour. Same photographs were scored subjectively by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) using the Harvard breast cosmesis scale. The patient-reported self-scoring was also recorded. RESULTS: The MDT results were favorable (excellent\good) in 72.3% of the photographs and adverse in 27.7%. Agreement among the MDT members was strong (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.798, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.753-0.937, Cronbach's alpha = 0.809). The patient self-scoring was satisfactory in 82.5% of the cases and nonsatisfactory in 17.5%. The results of the OBCS ranged between 0.0 and 20.4 with a median value of 4.5. There was a strong significant correlation between the OBCS and both the MDT subjective scoring (p < 0.001) and the patient self-scoring (p < 0.001).

Especially in cases of recurrence after surgery and radiation therapy, curative management of the disease can rarely be achieved. Therefore several palliative treatment modalities have been developed. Intraoperative radiation therapy represents one of them it allows a single high-dose irradiation of a region which, in light of the global tumor disorder, cannot be cured by surgical intervention. Methods/Patients: Between 1989 and 1994, 70 patients with recurrent metastases in the head and neck lymph nodes were treated with IORT in the ENT Department of the University Hospital Aachen in collaboration with the Radiation Department. Since some patients were irradiated up to four times, 91 operations (77 under general anesthesia and 14 under local anesthesia) and irradiations were performed. During the procedure each, patient had to be transported twice from the standard operating suite to the radiation unit and back. Results: Regarding the palliative intention of IORT in these cases, we mainly evaluated parameters which had an influence on quality of life of the patients: duration of hospitalization, pain treatment, removal of necrotic tumor mass, and safety of treatment. Depending on the general condition, the patients stayed in the hospital for 3-56 days (median: 10 days). In almost every case, mental and to some extent physical integrity was restored for some time after the disfiguring tumor on the neck had been removed. In nearly 90%, pain treatment could be reduced (e.g., discontinuation of opiate treatment) or further progression could be avoided (74%). Despite the transportation only few complications occured, which primarily involved healing disturbances (n = 8), fistulas (n = 3), and edemas of the arm (n = 2; after primary treatment of breast cancer). There was no serious infection observed under prophylactic antibiotic treatment in 74% of the cases. Local tumor control (LTC), which only was of minor interest in this treatment group, was possible depending on the extent of tumor resection that could be achieved during the surgical approach: R0 resection -> 50% LTC/R1 resection -> 40% LTC/R2 resection (72.5% of the cases) -> 24.8% LTC. Follow-up of the surviving patients lasted 6-26 months (mean: 14.4 months) but generally did not allow an exact assessment of the time of tumor control. Conclusions: IORT of recurrent metastases in the head and neck region in our opinion represents an effective alternative for palliative treatment. Important aspects of the patients' quality of life could be improved, and patients were then able to take part in social life again for some time. On the other hand tumor control was not to be expected since in most of the cases only an incomplete tumor resection was achieved. However, the extent of resection substantially affects local tumor control in the head and neck region.",,0

Al-Attar,2012.0,Focus on technique: supporting the soft-tissue envelope in breast reconstruction,10.1097/PRS.0b013e3182625852,"Prosthetic-based breast reconstruction commonly involves device placement in either a total submuscular pocket or a partial subpectoral position for just superior pole coverage, with various possible strategies for inferior pole coverage. Historically, the pectoralis major muscle is managed either by suturing the muscle to the inferior flap or with marionette sutures; alternatively, the device is placed under total muscle/fascia coverage (under the pectoralis major, plus the serratus anterior and rectus abdominis muscles or fascia). For many plastic surgeons, acellular dermal matrix is now used instead to function as a sling or hammock"" supporting the periprosthetic pocket and thus covering the inferior pole of the device, attached to the pectoralis major muscle above and to the inframammary fold below. In addition to its added soft-tissue support in the inferior pole, acellular dermal matrix may help to stabilize the pectoralis major muscle along its inferolateral margin, create a well-defined inframammary fold, provide the opportunity to significantly increase intraoperative fill volume of the tissue expander, and reduce the incidence or severity of significant or symptomatic capsular contracture, particularly in a patient whose breast has been treated with radiation. In addition to its indications in primary breast reconstruction, acellular dermal matrix has been increasingly used in secondary revision reconstruction cases. It can be used to buttress capsulorrhapy and capsulotomy sites and it can be used to replace periprosthetic capsule following capsulectomy. While clinical experience is accruing for these indications, acellular dermal matrix continues to be used in primary and secondary breast reconstruction.""",eng,0

According to the consensus statements of ASTRO (45.1%) and ESTRO (41.4%) about half of the eligible patients were treated with IORT as APBI. From the eligible patients fulfilling the criteria for IORT boost (35%) about one third was eventually treated.Conclusions: Patient selection for IORT should be restrictive. For IORT as APBI the TARGIT trials are even more restrictive including patients than the ESTRO and ASTRO consensus statements. © 2014 Sperk et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.""",,0

In addition to whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) a boost to the tumor bed leads to a better local control. The tumor bed boost is usually added after WBRT or can be done intraoperative (IORT). Belletti et al. (Clin Cancer Res., 2008) described positive effects, an antitumoral effect and modulation of microenvironment after IORT with 50kV x-rays. A matched pair analysis was performed to investigate the impact of IORT boost on overall survival compared to standard external beam boost. Methods: Between 2002 - 2009, 370 patients were treated for breast cancer with WBRT + boost (external beam (EBRT) boost n = 146, IORT boost n =224). A matched pair analysis (1:1 propensity score matching for age, TNM, grading, hormonal treatment and chemotherapy) for overall survival and local recurrence free survival could be done for 53 pairs. All patients underwent breast conserving surgery and WBRT with 46-50Gy. 53 patients received an EBRT boost with 16Gy (2Gy/fraction, dedicated linear accelerator) and 53 patients received an IORT boost with 20Gy (INTRABEAM system, 50kV x-rays). Median follow-up was 6 months (range, 1-77 months) for the EBRT boost patients and 56 months (range, 2-97 months) for IORT boost patients. Kaplan Meier estimates were performed for overall survival and local recurrence free survival. Results: IORT boost patients had a longer follow-up than EBRT boost patients. Despite the difference in follow-up times, there was a strong trend towards better overall survival after IORT boost (90.2% vs. 62.3%, p = 0.375). One local recurrence was present in each group (EBRT boost after 15 months, local recurrence free survival 95%; IORT boost after 12 months, local recurrence free survival 98.1%). Conclusions: IORT given as a boost seems to have a positive impact on overall survival in breast cancer patients after breast conserving surgery. To identify such an effect a prospective randomized trial should be conducted.",,0

Now the German cohort of patients was analyzed regarding local recurrence and survival. The German cohort was supposed to be more homogeneous than the international cohort (age, treatment, smaller tumours < 2 cm). Methods: 734 patients were randomized either to the TARGIT group (n = 366), where after breast conserving surgergy (BCS) an IORT was added (20 Gy) during the same procedure. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT, 46-50 Gy) was added per protocol if high risk factors (lymphovascular invasion, positive lymph nodes or resection margins, extensive intraductal component, T2) were present. Or patients were randomized to the EBRT group (n = 368), where BCS was followed by EBRT as a standard procedure (56 Gy to the whole breast). Kaplan Meier estimates (5 years) were performed for local relapse and overall survival. Results: After 5 years, 4 local recurrences as primary endpoint were seen in the TARGIT group and 1 in the EBRT group, p = 0.19. As secondary endpoint 6 deaths (3 breast cancer deaths, 3 non breast cancer deaths) were seen in the TARGIT group and 12 deaths (5 breast cancer deaths, 7 non breast cancer deaths) in EBRT group, p = 0.01. Significantly less non breast cancer deaths were reported after IORT compared to the EBRT group, p = 0.04. No difference could be seen for breast cancer deaths, p = 0.45. Conclusion: Patients treated within the TARGIT A trial in Germany have excellent 5 year outcomes regarding local control and overall survival. A significantly better overall survival was seen in the TARGIT group.",,0

This is the first analysis of long-term toxicities in the setting of TARGIT. Between 02/2002 and 12/2008, 305 patients were treated within TARGIT A (Arm A: n = 34 IORT, n = 20 IORT + WBRT for risk factors; Arm B WBRT: n = 55) or received IORT as a planned boost (control group: n = 196) at a single center. Toxicity was assessed according to the LENT SOMA scales. No significant differences were seen between Arm A and Arm B regarding fibrosis, breast edema, retraction, ulceration, lymphedema, hyperpigmentation, and pain. Arm A had significantly less telangiectases compared to Arm B (p = 0.049). In the subanalysis (Arm A IORT vs. Arm A IORT + WBRT vs. Arm B), fibrosis had a cumulative rate of 5.9 versus 37.5 versus 18.4 %, respectively (38.2 % IORT boost control group), at 3 years. No telangiectases were seen after IORT alone (0 % Arm A IORT vs. 17.5 % Arm A IORT + WBRT vs. 17.7 % Arm B). The hazard ratio of higher grade toxicity as first event was 0.46 (95 % CI, 0.26-0.83) for Arm A IORT as compared to Arm B (p = 0.010). No recurrences were seen after a median follow-up of 40 months (Arm A) and 42 months (Arm B). With its very low chronic skin toxicity rates and outstanding long-term results regarding toxicity and local control, IORT with 50 kV X-rays is a safe and effective method for treatment of selected breast cancer patients. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,1

Miccoli,2013.0,Radioguided localization of occult colonic lesions during open or laparoscopic surgery: an update,", ","The applications of radioguided surgery, an approach to oncologic surgery involving a multidisciplinary team, are expanding at a rapid pace. The technique of radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) was originally introduced in the mid- 90s for applications in breast surgery, and later adapted also to other tumor lesions such as solitary pulmonary nodules (during either open or laparoscopic surgery) and colonic lesions. Concerning the latter, in particular, the technique called radioguided occult colonic lesion identification (ROCLI) consists of identifying, with the aid of intraoperative gammaprobe counts, small lesions that may escape colic intraoperative palpation, after prior tagging of the lesions performed endoscopically through peri- or intra-lesional injection of Technetium-99m-labeled human albumin macroaggregates (99mTc- MAA), a particulate radiopharmaceutical (25-100 mum) that does not migrate from the site of interstitial administration. Since September 2001, ROCLI has been employed in 12 patients, using a collimated gamma- probe measuring 11 mm in external diameter (Scintiprobe MR100 Pol.Hi.Tech.). All patients underwent preoperative colonoscopy in order to inject 0.2 mL of a 99mTc-MAA suspension (10-20 MBq) into the submucosa or intra-perilesionally; such tagging required only a few minutes. Eight of the 12 patients were then submitted to open laparotomy, while laparoscopic access was utilized in the remaining 4 patients. In all 12 patients, localization of the lesion with the ROCLI technique was technically feasible, safe, efficient and highly accurate, enabling quick detection of the lesion during surgery, with a 100% success rate. No complications occurred, and there was no risk of contamination by ionizing radiation.",eng,0

Materials/Methods: Patients treated with 3D-CRT APBI received 38.5 Gy in 3.85 Gy twice daily fractions per dose-volume objectives specified in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel B-39/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0413 (NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413) trial. IORT patients received a 20 Gy fraction to the tumor cavity at time of resection. At each patient follow-up, routinely scheduled for 1 month, 3-6 months, and every 6 months thereafter, toxicities including rash, pruritus, hyperpigmentation, telangiectasias, fibrosis, induration and breast pain were graded using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Overall cosmesis was evaluated using modified Harvard criteria as: no change (Grade 1), changes only visible on close inspection or <25% asymmetry (Grade 2), and easily visible changes or >25% asymmetry (Grade 3). Outcomes were grouped into worst occurring at <6 months (early) and >6 months (late). Patient groups were compared by Fisher exact test or univariate logistic regression. Results: We analyzed 97 breasts (n=94 patients) receiving 3D-CRT APBI (median follow-up 17.2 months, range, 1-60 months), and 40 breasts (n=40) receiving IORT (median follow-up 7.0 months, range, 1-23 months). There was no difference in any early toxicity between 3D-CRT APBI and IORT (p > 0.1). Significantly worse late fibrosis and late breast pain were observed in the 3D-CRT group. Grade 1, 2, and 3 late fibrosis were 37%, 18%, and 4% for 3D-CRT versus 11%, 7%, and 0% for IORT (p < 0.001). Grade 1 and 2 late breast pain were 62% and 1% for 3D-CRT versus 43%, and 0% for IORT (p=0.001). No other significant late toxicity differences were observed. Conclusions: Compared to 3D-CRT APBI, IORT may be associated with less late breast pain and fibrosis. (Table Presented).",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A previously-published version of the linear quadratic (LQ) model, designed to address the impact of dose-gradients in brachytherapy applications, was used to determine the biological effective dose (BED), equivalent dose in 2 Gray per fraction (EQD2) and EUD for the most common fractionation scheme for the MammoSite catheter (34 Gy in 10 fractions prescribed to 1cm from the balloon surface), using a range of balloon sizes in a series of patients treated with single or multiple dwell positions. Toxicity from the MammoSite catheter was assessed and statistical associations with the calculated EUDs were investigated. RESULTS: The acute- and late-toxicity EUDs respectively range from 34.8-39.4 Gy and 33.4-37.6 Gy, with EUD decreasing as balloon diameter increases and/or the number of dwell positions increases. There was a positive association between EUD and hyperpigmentation and telangiectasia. CONCLUSIONS: For APBI using the Mammosite applicator, EUD is higher than the marginal prescription dose and, for the dose-fractionation patterns considered here, was associated with acute and late skin toxicity. EUD is a potentially useful parameter to characterize non-uniform dose distributions related to brachytherapy treatments. Further evaluation in future studies is warranted.",eng,0

Postoperative scar boost radiation for the reconstructed breast presents many planning challenges due to the shape, size, and curvature of the scar. High-dose-rate (HDR) surface applicator brachytherapy is a novel and effective method of delivering scar boost radiation. Two cases, one with a saline implant and one with a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap reconstruction, illustrate the method and advantages of HDR optimization of surface applicators. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 2 patients a mold of the breast was made with Aquaplast sheets. A reproducible system was used for arm positioning. Skin fiducials, including tattoos from external beam planning, were matched to fiducials on the mold. HDR catheters were sited on the mold at 1cm intervals, with the central catheter situated along the scar. Topographically, both scars demonstrated extreme curvature in both craniocaudal and mediolateral directions. A CT computer-optimized HDR plan was developed, with the reference dose prescribed at the skin surface. The dosimetry was compared to single-field and matched-field electron plans. RESULTS: This surface applicator technique provided a uniform skin dose of 100% to the entire clinical target volume (CTV) without hot spots in both patients. The patient position and surface applicator setup were consistently reproducible. The patients tolerated the treatment well with minimal skin erythema. In the single-field electron plan, skin dose was decreased to 50% at the periphery of the scar. Matching fields addressed this depth dose decrement, but resulted in large localized hot spots of more than 200% centrally in each field. CONCLUSION: CT computer-optimized HDR surface applicator brachytherapy provided a reproducible homogeneous method of treating highly curved scars on the reconstructed breast. Electron beam treatment would result in longer and more complex treatments yet still provide a less homogeneous dose than this surface applicator technique.",eng,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dosimetric analysis was conducted on patients receiving MammoSite breast brachytherapy following conservative surgery for invasive ductal carcinoma. Cardiac dose was evaluated for patients with left breast tumors with a CT scan encompassing the entire heart. Lung dose was evaluated for patients in whom the entire lung was scanned. The prescription dose of 3400 cGy was 1 cm from the balloon surface. MammoSite dosimetry was compared to simulated WBRT fields with and without radiobiological correction for the effects of dose and fractionation. Dose parameters such as the volume of the structure receiving 10 Gy or more (V10) and the dose received by 20 cc of the structure (D20), were calculated as well as the maximum and mean doses received. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were studied, five had complete lung data and six had left-sided tumors with complete cardiac data. Ipsilateral lung volumes ranged from 925-1380 cc. Cardiac volumes ranged from 337-551 cc. MammoSite resulted in a significantly lower percentage lung V30 and lung and cardiac V20 than the WBRT fields, with and without radiobiological correction. CONCLUSION: This study gives low values for incidental radiation received by the heart and ipsilateral lung using the MammoSite applicator. The volume of heart and lung irradiated to clinically significant levels was significantly lower with the MammoSite applicator than using simulated WBRT fields of the same CT data sets.",eng,0

METHODS: Patients with breast cancer underwent intraoperative brachytherapy catheter placement based on frozen section analysis with immediate postoperative APBI. The planning target volume evaluation (PTVEval) and organs at risk were contoured on daily pretreatment CT scans for each patient, and the original treatment plan was applied to assess full-course dosimetry. RESULTS: Of the first 21 patients consented for intraoperative catheter placement, 20 (95%) were able to proceed with treatment as planned. The mean volume of PTVEval receiving 90% of prescription dose (V90%) and mean percentage of prescription dose to 90% of the PTVEval (D90%) on initial planning were 96.7 (+/-1.1%) and 100.2 (+/-2.1%), respectively. Full-course dose coverage remained excellent with a mean PTVEval V90% and D90% of 95.0 (+/-4.4%) and 100.2 (+/-9.6%), respectively. Mean full-course maximum dose constraints for chest wall and skin were met by 70% and 95% of patients, respectively. Air accumulation >1 cc during treatment increased the risk of a daily fraction with PTVEval coverage below goal (odds ratio, 9.8; p = 0.05), whereas those with applicators <0.5 cm from the chest wall at planning were at risk of exceeding that organ's maximum dose constraint on a daily fraction (odds ratio, 45; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative catheter placement and early initiation of APBI based on frozen section pathology is feasible, yields acceptable dosimetry, and is an option for completing breast conserving therapy in less than 10 days.",Eng,0

However, accurate delivery of the IORT dose for breast cancer has been problematic due to difficulty estimating the tumor bed after tumor removal and tissue reapproximation. We are investigating the feasibility of partial breast irradiation using a single fraction of IORT delivered to the tumor in vivo prior to surgical resection. Methods: In a trial, approved by the University of North Carolina School of Medicine Institutional Review Board, patients >55 years old with infiltrating ductal carcinoma without an extensive intraductal component with an overall tumor size >3.0 cm receive a single dose of IORT in place of standard post-operative radiotherapy. Results: All patients undergo preoperative ultrasonography to define the target volume. In a standard operating room, the tumor is exposed through a standard partial mastectomy incision. IORT is then delivered using a mobile, self-shielded, magnetron-driven X-band linear accelerator (Intraop Corp, Santa Clara, CA, USA). 15 Gy is delivered to the 90% isodose line covering the tumor with a 1 cm margin anterior-posterior and 2 cm margins laterally. After IORT, partial mastectomy is performed in the usual manner. Conclusions: IORT for breast cancer, delivered to the exposed tumor in vivo, is feasible and allows accurate estimation of the tumor bed. Further follow-up is ongoing to determine the efficacy of this approach. © 2007 Society of Surgical Oncology.",,0

Klode,2015.0,Intraoperative Fluorescence Imaging for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection: Prospective Clinical Trial to Compare the Usefulness of Indocyanine Green vs Technetium Tc 99m for Identification of Sentinel Lymph Nodes,10.1001/jamasurg.2014.3502,"IMPORTANCE: The metastatic status of regional lymph nodes is the most relevant prognostic factor in breast cancer, melanoma, and other solid organ tumors with a lymphatic spread. The current gold standard for detection and targeted excision of the sentinel lymph node is preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with technetium Tc 99m. Because of the worldwide shortage of technetium Tc 99m, physicians are looking for nonradioactive dyes for sentinel lymph node labeling. Based on several retrospective studies, the fluorescent dye indocyanine green is considered a possible alternative to technetium Tc 99m. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the feasibility and clinical benefit of intraoperative near infrared fluorescence sentinel lymph node excision (SLNE) compared with standard technetium Tc 99m-guided SLNE using malignant melanoma in which SLNE is firmly established. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of a prospective clinical trial at the Skin Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen. Eighty patients with malignant melanoma on the trunk or extremities (upper and lower) who were scheduled to undergo SLNE were included in this study from January 1, 2013, to June 27, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Concordance of preoperative and intraoperative sentinel lymph node detection rates. RESULTS: During the study period, 80 patients were operated on with an additional intraoperative application of a near infrared fluorescent dye. In these 80 surgical procedures, 147 SLNs were excised. Detection of a technetium Tc 99m-marked SLN before surgery was possible in all cases. Intraoperative visualization of the SLN by indocyanine green before skin incision was successful in only 17 of 80 patients (21%). The number of SLNs identified using the near infrared fluorescence technique in the operative site after skin incision and initial tissue preparation was 141 of 147 (96%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients in whom the lymph node basin cannot be predicted correctly (eg, in cutaneous melanoma on the trunk), the use of indocyanine green for SLN detection is severely limited compared with SLNE using standard technique guided by technetium Tc 99m. Therefore, SLNE with the use of radiocolloid, followed if possible by single-photon emission computed tomography, remains the gold standard.

Petrushevska,2015.0,Internal Mammary Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer - Effects on Disease Prognosis and Therapeutic Protocols - A Case Report,10.3889/oamjms.2015.025,"BACKGROUND: The main prognostic factor in early staged breast cancer is the axillary lymph node metastatic affection. Sentinel lymph node biopsy, as a staging modality, significantly decreases surgical morbidity. The status of internal mammary lymph nodes gains an increased predictive role in grading breast carcinomas and modulation of postoperative therapeutic protocols. If positive, almost always are associated with worse disease outcome. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of internal mammary lymph node micrometastases has not been up to date precisely defined. AIM: To present a case of female patient clinically diagnosed as T1, N0, M0 (clinical TNM) ductal breast carcinoma with scintigraphic detection of internal mammary and axillary sentinel lymph nodes. METHODS: Dual method of scintigraphic sentinel lymph node detection using 99mTc-SENTI-SCINT and blue dye injection, intraoperative gamma probe detection, radioguided surgery and intraoperative ex tempore biopsy were used. CASE REPORT: We present a case of clinically T1, N0, M0 ductal breast cancer with scintigraphic detection of internal mammary and axillary sentinel lymph nodes. Intraoperative ex tempore biopsy revealed micrometastases in the internal mammary node and no metastatic involvement of the axillary sentinel lymph node. CONCLUSION: Detection of internal mammary lymph node metastases improves N (nodal) grading of breast cancer by selecting a high risk subgroup of patients that require adjuvant hormone therapy, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.",eng,0

Journal Article,H. Strander; I. Turesson; E. Cavallin-Stahl,2003.0,A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in soft tissue sarcomas,", ","A systematic review of radiation therapy trials in several tumour types was performed by The Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU). The procedures for evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2003; 42: 357-365). This synthesis of the literature on radiation therapy for soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is based on data from five randomized trials. Moreover, data from 6 prospective studies, 25 retrospective studies and 3 other articles were used. In total, 39 scientific articles are included, involving 4 579 patients. The results were compared with those of a similar overview from 1996 which included 3 344 patients. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: The well-established prognostic factors for tumour-related death from STS-histological grade, tumour size and age-are well documented. The importance of superficial versus deep site as well as the anatomic site is also reaffirmed to some extent. There is strong evidence that adjuvant radiotherapy improves the local control rate in combination with conservative surgery in the treatment of STS of extremities and trunk in patients with negative, marginal or minimal microscopic positive surgical margins. A local control rate of 90% has been achieved. Improvement is obtained with radiotherapy added in the case of intralesional surgery, but the local control rate is somewhat lower. More studies are needed on this issue. For STS in other anatomic sites, retroperitoneum, head and neck, breast and uterus, there is only weak indication of a benefit for the local control rate, with the use of adjuvant radiotherapy. There is still insufficient data to establish that preoperative radiotherapy is favourable compared to postoperative radiotherapy for local control in patients presenting primarily with large tumours. One small study has shown a possible survival benefit for preoperative radiotherapy. There is fairly good evidence to suggest that the preoperative setting results in more wound complications. There is no randomized study comparing external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. The data suggest that external beam radiotherapy and low dose rate brachytherapy result in comparable local control for high-grade tumours. Some patients with low-grade soft tissue sarcomas benefit from external beam radiotherapy in terms of local control. Brachytherapy with low dose rate for low-grade tumours seems to be of no benefit, but data are sparse. The available data are inconclusive concerning the effect of intraoperative high dose rate radiotherapy for retroperitoneal STS. Further studies are needed. Neutron radiotherapy might be beneficial for patients with low- and intermediate-grade tumours considered inoperable and for those operated with intralesional margins. More severe side effects for neutrons have been registered. In two small studies investigating hyperfractionation schedules there was no indication of improvements compared to daily fractions of 2 Gy. Further studies should be encouraged. One small study using preoperative limb perfusion with TNF alpha melphalan and +/- interferon gamma combined with postoperative radiotherapy in the case of marginal or positive surgical margin has shown excellent local control without enhanced morbidity.",eng,0
Journal Article,S. L. Stratmann; T. M. McCarty; J. A. Kuhn,1999.0,Radiation safety with breast sentinel node biopsy,", ","BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy with Technetium 99m sulfur colloid (Tc99m) is an evolving technique that offers the potential for improved staging of breast cancer with decreased morbidity. However, the use of radioactive materials in the operating room generates significant concern about radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate radiation exposure to operating room personnel, pathologist, and equipment from specimens during breast sentinel lymph node biopsy. METHODS: Twenty patients were injected with 0.7 to 1.1 mCi of Tc99m sulfur colloid 1.5 to 3 hours before sentinel lymph node biopsy. A calibrated Geiger counter was used to measure dose rates from the breast injection site before skin incision (n = 20), lumpectomy specimens (n = 8), and sentinel nodes (n = 20) at distances of 3, 30, and 300 cm. This represented exposure to the surgeon's hands, surgeon's torso, and scrub nurse, respectively. Exposure to the pathologist's hands and torso was represented as dose-rate measurements from lumpectomy and nodal specimens. The operative instruments, trash receptacles, suction canisters, pathology slides, and cryostat machines were measured at 3 cm at the conclusion of each procedure. Specimens or equipment emitting radiation doses equal to background levels (0.04 mRem/h) were exempt from special handling and disposal. RESULTS: The highest exposure rate was to the surgeon's hands from the breast injection site before skin incision (34.25 mRem/h). Exposure to the surgeon's torso measured 1.33 mRem/h, and exposure to the scrub nurse's torso measured 0.15 mRem/h from the injection site. Exposure to the pathologist's hands was 18.62 and 0.06 mRem/h from the lumpectomy specimen and sentinel node, respectively. Exposure to the pathologist's torso measured 0.34 and 0.04 mRem/h from the lumpectomy specimen and sentinel node, respectively. One hundred percent of lumpectomy specimens measured above the exempt level. Thirty-two of 46 (70%) sentinel lymph nodes emitted radiation equal to the exempt background level. Seventeen of 20 trash receptacles (85%) and 4 of 12 (33%) suction canisters measured equal to background levels. All operative instruments, pathology slides, and cryostat machines were equal to background levels. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure to operating room personnel, pathologists, and operative equipment during a breast sentinel node biopsy using Tc99m is minimal. A primary surgeon can perform 2,190 hours, a scrub nurse 33,333 hours, and a pathologist 14,705 hours of procedural work before surpassing Occupational Safety and Health Administration limits. Operative instruments, pathology slides, and cryostat machines do not require special handling. All lumpectomy specimens should be stored for decontamination until the dose rate equals background levels. Intraoperative dose-rate monitoring allows selective decontamination of nodal specimens, trash receptacles, and suction canisters, which decreases disposal time and cost.",eng,0

The method of PBI with the longest published follow-up is multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy. Balloon-based brachytherapy with the MammoSite brachytherapy applicator was designed to simplify the brachytherapy procedure for PBI, enhance the reproducibility of the dosimetry, and improve patient comfort. The rates of local recurrence following PBI with the MammoSite applicator have been low, but there are few published reports and follow-up has been relatively short. The cosmetic outcomes and toxicity of MammoSite PBI are comparable to those seen after multicatheter-based PBI. Additional methods of balloon brachytherapy, including Xoft and SenoRx Contura have been developed. Finally, long-term follow-up after PBI is important for the welfare of individual patients and in order to establish the efficacy, late toxicity and cosmetic outcomes of this technique. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Materials: The treatment heads design data of two mLINACs and experimental dose data measured in water were provided by the manufacturer (SORDINA S.p.A., Padova, Italy). The electron beams energies of the first mLINAC (75mum brass target) were 4, 6, 8 and 10 MeV, those of the second (820mum Aluminum target) were 6, 8, 10 and 12 MeV. The beam is collimated by PMMA cylindrical applicators with diameters ranging from 30 to 100 mm. To reconstruct the unknown energy spectrum monoenergetic beams with energies ranging from 2 to 14.6 MeV binned in 0.1 MeV steps have been simulated for each applicator. The dose statistical uncertainty was kept around 0,5%. A maximum likelihood optimization routine was used along with the corresponding measured profiles to obtain the weight of each energy bin. The optimized spectrum has been used as input of Monte Carlo code to calculate dose distributions based on CT images of patients who undergo IORT using both mLINACs. Results: The optimized energy spectrum reproduces the measured depth and off-axis dose profiles in water to better than an overall 1,6 % and to better than 0.5% between the build-up and the practical range for both LINACs. The computed output factors agreed with the measured ones within 2% with worse agreement for the smaller applicators and lower energies, probably due to measurement uncertainties. Based on optimized energy spectrum, the Monte Carlo code has been used to calculate dose distribution using both mLINACs and the CT images of 4 patients, one for each of the tumour sites/patologies that most frequently require a IORT treatment (breasts, head and neck, prostate and sarcomas). Conclusions: A better characterization of the electron beam in IORT techniques arises from the need for a treatment planning system to be introduced into clinical practice for a more accurate evaluation of the dose distribution. In this work, Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate the energy spectrum from measured data. The Monte Carlo simulation also allows us to calculate the dose distributions in IORT patients based on CT images and both mLINAcs. Monte Carlo simulation dose distributions can be also used as benchmark of treatment planning systems and to help physicians and physicists in the treatment optimization when critical structures cannot be at all removed or shielded during IORT delivered using mLINAcs.",,0

Unfortunately the technique used to give this boost differed widely fromone institution to another, although externalbeamboosts by X-rays or electrons (sometimes as IORT) or iridiumimplants are themost popular. The author analyzes different risk factors for local recurrence after breast conserving surgery, particularly value of dose size and technique of boost irradiation on tumor control probability and side effects. Different techniques of brachytherapy and external beamradiation therapy (EBRT) - advantages and possible disadvantages' are discussed in detail and compared with one other. Results as well of retrospective studies as of one prospective trial comparing brachytherapy and EBRT and possible implications for daily praxis are presented and analyzed. Conclusion: Boost reduces the local recurrence rate at leastwith F = 0.5without benefit regarding overall survival. As standard dose applies 16 Gy, but risk adapted doses should be usedmore often. It seems that the best techniques for boost irradiation are Interstitial Brachytherapy and IORT. In individual hospitals as benchmark for quality of boost irradiation [at least for small tumors (pT1-2)] should be the recurrence rate in value of 0.5%/year or less. The interstitial brachytherapy for boost irradiation should be preferred particularly if the tumor is located < 2-3 cm below skin or below nipple or if the boost dose > 16 Gy should be given.",,0

Here, we present 5-year follow-up results. METHODS: We did a phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial at 16 hospitals and medical centres in seven European countries. 1184 patients with low-risk invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ treated with breast-conserving surgery were centrally randomised to either whole-breast irradiation or APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy. The primary endpoint was local recurrence. Analysis was done according to treatment received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00402519. FINDINGS: Between April 20, 2004, and July 30, 2009, 551 patients had whole-breast irradiation with tumour-bed boost and 633 patients received APBI using interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy. At 5-year follow-up, nine patients treated with APBI and five patients receiving whole-breast irradiation had a local recurrence; the cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 1.44% (95% CI 0.51-2.38) with APBI and 0.92% (0.12-1.73) with whole-breast irradiation (difference 0.52%, 95% CI -0.72 to 1.75; p=0.42). No grade 4 late side-effects were reported. The 5-year risk of grade 2-3 late side-effects to the skin was 3.2% with APBI versus 5.7% with whole-breast irradiation (p=0.08), and 5-year risk of grade 2-3 subcutaneous tissue late side-effects was 7.6% versus 6.3% (p=0.53). The risk of severe (grade 3) fibrosis at 5 years was 0.2% with whole-breast irradiation and 0% with APBI (p=0.46). INTERPRETATION: The difference between treatments was below the relevance margin of 3 percentage points. Therefore, adjuvant APBI using multicatheter brachytherapy after breast-conserving surgery in patients with early breast cancer is not inferior to adjuvant whole-breast irradiation with respect to 5-year local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival.

Journal Article,R. A. Strohl,1990.0,Radiation therapy. Recent advances and nursing implications,", ","Radiation therapy is one of the oldest treatments available for cancer management. Since the discovery of x-rays and radioactivity in the 1890s, patients have been treated with radiation. Advances in equipment and in the understanding of radiobiology permit delivery of effective doses of radiation to tumors while minimizing normal tissue damage. Recent advances in radiation have expanded the scope of treatment. Large-field, large-dose radiation, such as half-body treatment, permits treatment of metastatic disease in an effective and well-tolerated manner in patients too ill to travel for therapy. Total skin electron therapy has been successful in managing extensive skin disease. Hyperfractionated treatment is an experimental approach that attempts to achieve better tumor control by treating with two fractions per day. Intraoperative radiation is a conceptually sound but logistically cumbersome plan in which treatment is given in a single fraction at the time of surgery. Its full potential may be realized when the technical difficulties of administration can be overcome. Brachytherapy is the use of radioactive sources implanted directly into the tumor or in a cavity in proximity to the tumor. Techniques have improved in both surgery and radiation, which allow previously inaccessible sites such as the brain to be implanted. Early-stage breast cancer has been effectively managed with lumpectomy followed by radiation. Hyperthermia is the use of heat in conjunction with radiation. Heat has been found to enhance the effect of radiation and limit the repair of radiation damage. The properties of heat cause it to be more damaging to tumor cells than to normal ones. The ability to sensitize cancer cells to radiation and protect normal cells from radiation has been an ongoing research objective. Clinical trials are in progress to isolate effective, easily administered, and nontoxic compounds. The nurse caring for the patient receiving radiation must have an understanding of how radiation works and what the treatment goals are for the patient. Radiation is a difficult modality for patients to understand. Many fears and concerns are based on this lack of comprehension. The nurse must be prepared to describe the experience of receiving radiation and assist patients to anticipate and manage side effects. Patients need to know what to expect from therapy in terms they can understand. Recent advances and experimental treatments should be explained in terms of what is known including the rationale for the procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",eng,0

Endpoints are: efficacy; toxicity; quality of life; frailty scores; cosmetic results. Material and Methods: Written informed consent was obtained in all cases. We included low risk breast cancer patients: age >60 years and a tumour diameter of <3 cm: if the diameter was >2 cm the Her2 receptor status had to be negative and the estrogen receptor status had to be positive. Patients with multicentric disease, lymph node metastasis, irradical resection, contralateral breast cancer and/or history of malignant disease <5 year before diagnosis or recurrent disease was not included. IOERT was administered immediately after the lumpectomy (and sentinel node procedure). A total dose of 23.3 Gy was given with a tube diameter of 5-6 cm and 9-12 MeV. External beam APBI was administered postoperatively: 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks. Levels of pain and fatigue were registered by the patients according to the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and BR23 questionnaires before surgery, at 1-3 weeks and after 3, 6, and 12 months, thereafter yearly (response rate >90%). For the external APBI cases we also monitored after surgery and before radiotherapy. Results: Until 01-10-2015 a total of 238 IOERT and 117 external APBI cases were included. The mean follow-up periods were 20 months and 15 months and >2 year follow-up in 102 and 44 patients, respectively. Acute grade III-IV toxicity was noticed in 8% and 5%, for the IOERT and external APBI cases, respectively. For both groups we noticed moderate increased levels of fatigue and pain around the period of treatment, which thereafter returned to pre-treatment levels in 6-12 months. Liponecrosis was observed in 30-40% of the IOERT cases and disappeared after 6-12 months. For both groups the cosmetic result was good/excellent in the vast majority of cases. In 2 IOERT patients we observed port-site metastases. The 14 non-breast cancers (NBC) had various histology's. Further details of treatment efficacy for both groups are given in the table. Conclusions: The local recurrence rates and toxicity levels were low. We noticed 2 port-site metastases in the IOERT group: a new phenomenon in breast conserving radiotherapy.

Methods and materials: We included 71 breast cancer patients. Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel node procedure had started almost 3 years earlier. Subsequently, 26 patients were treated with IOERT and 45 patients received postoperative whole breast irradiation (WBI). For both groups we determined seven dimensionless asymmetry features. We compared the subjectively and the objectively derived cosmetic scores with each other. Results: For four asymmetry features we noted significantly smaller differences for patients treated with IOERT when compared to those treated with WBI: relative breast contour difference, relative breast area difference and relative breast overlap difference. After correcting for excision volume a significant difference was noticed also for relative lower breast contour. For the IOERT group the cosmetic scores excellent or good"" as determined by each patient and one physician were 88 and 96 %, respectively. When the overall cosmetic scores for patients treated with IOERT and WBI were compared to those of the objectively derived scores, there was a fair level of agreement. Conclusion: For patients treated with IOERT we noted less asymmetry and high rates of ""good or excellent"" subjectively derived cosmetic scores. The level of agreement between the subjectively and the objectively derived cosmetic scores was limited. Due to the small sample size and the design of the study no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Copyright © 2016 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg""",,1

We reviewed our single-institution experience with APBI in patients considered cautionary"" by ASTRO to determine patterns of recurrence. METHODS: An institutional review board-approved, retrospective chart review was conducted from January 2004 to November 2009. We identified 106 ""cautionary"" patients with 109 BC. All patients were treated with BCS followed by APBI via balloon catheter brachytherapy. ""Cautionary"" criteria include patients aged 50-59 years, tumor size 2.1-3.0 cm, close margins (<2 mm), focal lymphovascular invasion, estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, invasive lobular carcinoma, or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) </= 3 cm. Rates of recurrence at any site were evaluated. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 3 years. There were 3 IBTR (2.8%) at a median of 3.2 years. The 3-year actuarial IBTR rate was 1.8%. Patients with ER-negative invasive cancers had a higher IBTR rate compared with ER-positive patients (11.8% vs. 2.2%), although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.18). There were no IBTR in 46 patients with DCIS. On univariate analysis, there was no association between ""cautionary"" criteria and risk of local, regional, or distant recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Patients considered ""cautionary"" for APBI based on ASTRO guidelines had low rates of IBTR. ER-negative patients trended toward a higher IBTR rate with APBI compared with ER-positive patients. Longer follow-up is needed to establish the safety of APBI in ""cautionary"" patients.""",eng,0

Review of the limited world literature on repeat breast-conserving surgery suggests that the risk of secondary local in-breast recurrence may be too high in unselected patients following this approach. Rapid evolution of radiation therapy techniques has brought partial-breast irradiation (PBI) to the forefront as a potential local treatment for women with in-breast local recurrence following repeat breast-conserving surgery. This review gives an overview of the biological rationale for PBI; reviews techniques, potential benefits, and complications of PBI; and describes a new phase II national cooperative group trial evaluating PBI following repeat breast-conserving surgery.

Journal Article,H. D. Suit; J. Becht; J. Leong; M. Stracher; W. C. Wood; L. Verhey; M. Goitein,1988.0,Potential for improvement in radiation therapy,", ","A successful strategy for improving the efficacy of radiation therapy has been to improve dose distribution, that is, reduce treatment volume toward target volume. This is so as the smaller treatment volume has permitted a higher dose to the target (hence a high tumor control probability) and a lesser volume of non-target tissues being irradiated (consequently a reduced frequency and severity of treatment related morbidity). There are in place several important means for further improvements in dose distributions. These include: (a) 3D graphic reconstruction of the affected part with definition of the position of the tumor vis-a-vis the adjacent normal structures; (b) explicit inclusion in the treatment plan of the uncertainty band around each isodose contour; (c) on-line contrast enhanced visual monitoring of the target tissue during the individual treatment session; (d) gating of treatment so as to reduce the impact of patient motion on the needed treatment volume; (e) use of computer control systems to execute the treatment; and (f) use of treatment methods which achieve a reduced treatment volume. In an examination for sites for which treatment volumes might be decreased by a substantial factor we have compared treatment volumes for radical surgical and radiation therapy. Results are presented for carcinomas of the cervix (Stage IB), breast (Stage II), floor of mouth (Stage II). We describe a system developed here for on-line visual monitoring of the tissues covered by the treatment field. Brief descriptions are given of results of low LET charged particle radiation therapy and of intraoperative electron beam therapy. Also, the program developed here to use computer graphic techniques to display tumor and normal structures and isodose countours with uncertainty bands around each contour is mentioned.",eng,0

The modality is based on electron beams of MeV energies due to particular dose distribution in the tissue-equivalent environment [1,2]. Nowadays, most of the clinics worldwide carry on the IORT procedure using the electron sources based on the compact linear accelerators. However, in Russia historically several clinics have been using the sources based on betatrons. The main advantages of the betatrons are the possibility to change the beam energy in a wide range with small steps (e.g. 2-6 MeV with spacing 0.5 MeV), low energy spread of the beam and the relatively low cost of a device (typically $ 200 000). These days our team develops new generation of betatrons with extracted electron beam for IORT and skin cancer treatment. Materials and Methods: The investigation of 3D dose distributions generated by new prototype of IORT source based on betatron was carried out in the energy range 2-6 MeV with 500 keV steps. The dose distributions were measured using plane-parallel and cylindrical ionization chambers and Unidose-E electrometer [3-5] and radiochromic films Gafchromic EBT-3 [6-9]. The films were calibrated using 10 MeV electron beam of Electa Axcess accelerator and 2 MeV beam of our betatron. . All measurements were performed in tissue-equivalent phantom with zero air gap. Results: The results of radiochromic film calibration are shown in Fig.1. The calibration was carried out for both red and green channels of the film. Basing on obtained calibration the measurements of absolute dose distributions were carried out. Fig. 2 shows the 2D distribution of the absolute absorbed dose in the phantom obtained for 2 MeV electron energy of betatron. Discussion: The results obtained show that the betatron with extracted electron beam could be considered as a suitable source for development of IORT complex. However more efforts should be invested in the development of appropriate system of the radiation field formation. (Figure Presented).",,0

Breast conservation therapy, irradiation of whole breast following lumpectomy, requires daily treatment for 5 to 6 weeks. Although this is a successful and well tolerated treatment, many patients choose to avoid whole breast irradiation as a result of time and travel difficulties. In contrast, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has been investigated as a possible alternative to conventional postlumpectomy treatment. We have introduced some kinds of treatment patterns which are external beam radiation treatment, intraoperative treatment, and brachytherapy as a physical point of view. And then which treatment case is applicable and possible to Japanese women with early-stage breast cancer has been considered. In initial APBI, the multicatheter-base interstitial brachytherapy was developed and used as a boost following whole-breast radiotherapy. Once the implant geometry is known, dosimetric planning is completed to determine how to optimally place the radioactive source within the catheters for dose delivery. Although this technique assures the goals of target coverage and dose homogeneity, there are some disadvantages that are the degree of operator dependence and the reproducibility of this procedure. In response to the technical difficulties associated with multicatheter, interstitial brachytherapy, and the general appearance of the breast with catheters in place, alternative methods of dose delivery have now been created that reduce the complexity and invasiveness of APBI. That is balloon catheter treatment device (MammoSite) designed to simplify the brachytherapy procedure, while improving the reproducibility of dosimetric coverage of the target. In order to reduce the skin dose, the inherent physical feature, non-isotropic dose distribution of 192-Ir source, is adopted to treatment planning and insert procedure for the balloon. Basically the single dwell position inside the balloon tube is used for the treatment planning. In some cases three or five dwell positions are used to improve isodose distributions. Since high-dose-rate brachytherapy can change the dwell time for each dwell position, we can adjust the isodose distribution to reduce the dose to skin and/or chest wall. In an external beam radiation therapy, 3D-conformal radiation therapy is widely used for APBI. It is possible that the dose to skin is lower than brachytherapy treatment, because of the build-up effect for the external beam radiation therapy, and the dose homogeneity inside the tumor cavity has been achieved. However, we have to pay attention to the impact to the irradiation accuracy by the influence of a set-up error and breathing motion during irradiation. Since it requires multiple field angles to conform the dose to the target in the breast, the technique can significantly increase the integral dose received by surrounding normal structures. Intraoperative radiotherapy has been the primary focus of investigation for the delivery of APBI outside the United States. All of the adjuvant radiation is delivered at the time of surgery, thus maximally accelerating dose delivery and patient convenience. The irradiation that uses the electron beam and the soft X-ray (low energy e-rays : 50kv) has been done in Europe. Under the situation that it is not certain where to enhance a microscopic margin and axillary nodal status of the tumor. The difficulty is required to guarantee the identification of the tumor and the cover ratio of the amount of dose. At least all target tissue is within the electron field boundaries, while nontargeted normal tissue is either outside the limits of the electron field or shielded. The thinness of the mammary gland and the area of the determination edge suture are different from America and European countries compared with Japanese women. If APBI might be useful choice in the near future, as a matter of fact, the 3D-conformal radiation therapy might likely become the dominant techniques to Japanese women since th s procedure is noninvasive and well-cosmetic effect, although more work needs to be done.",,0

This leads many women to choose mastectomy when breast-conserving therapy would give a similar end result and allow the patient to keep her natural breast. Partial breast irradiation in selected patients has been shown to have comparable recurrence rates as whole-breast treatment. Partial breast radiation should be offered to women who would otherwise be limited in their treatment options, with the result that recurrence rates will be similar with much less morbidity and the added benefit of being an outpatient procedure. Method: Women who would be candidates for breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy were given the choice of either therapy. Partial breast radiation was also given as an alternative to patients who met appropriate criteria. In an outpatient setting, these women underwent segmental resection, sentinel node biopsy, and partial breast irradiation using the Intrabeam single-dose delivery applicator as described in the recently published Targit trial. Patients were selected based on factors of age, tumor size, tumor histology, consistent with the Targit criteria. Results : Eighty-five women have undergone outpatient treatment over the last 4 years. There have been only 2 recurrences in the post-op ipsilateral breast. Only 1 was at the excision site. The second was in a distant quadrant and was considered a second primary. Morbidity has been minimal. Erythema and seroma are the principal complications. Infection has been rare. Patient satisfaction has been universally positive. Follow-up mammograms and physical exams have consistently shown a naturally appearing breast. Conclusions : Breast-conserving therapy is underutilized in rural America. Partial breast irradiation using the 1- dose Intrabeam technique in combination with segmental resection and sentinel node allows many more rural women to preserve their breasts with comparable survival and recurrence rates as standard whole-breast therapy.",,0

Methods: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were performed to calculate dose distributions involving a pacemaker in Ir-192 HDR balloon brachytherapy. Dose perturbations by varying balloon-to-pacemaker distances (BPD 50 or 100 mm) and concentrations of iodine contrast medium (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 by volume) in the balloon were investigated for separate parts of the pacemaker (i.e., battery and substrate). Relative measurements using an ion-chamber were also performed to confirm MC results. Results: The MC and measured results in homogeneous media without a pacemaker agreed with published data within 2 from the balloon surface to 100 mm BPD.

The MC results showed that doses over the battery were increased by a factor of 3, compared to doses without a pacemaker. However, there was no significant dose perturbation in the middle of substrate but up to 70 dose increase in the substrate interface with the titanium capsule. The attenuation by iodine contrast medium lessened doses delivered to the pacemaker by up to 9.

We investigated dose perturbations when treating pacemaker-implanted patients with HDR breast balloon brachytherapy. Materials/Methods: A pacemaker and a single-lumen catheter were placed in water. An Ir-192 HDR source was delivered into the balloon center with a specific dwell time and then doses were measured using a 0.125cc ion chamber. The above setup was modeled by using the GATE/ Geant4 Monte Carlo (MC) code to obtain dose distributions involving a pacemaker. Distilled water and various concentrations of contrast were assigned into the balloon. For each irradiation case, dose profiles with and without the pacemaker were computed. It was normalized such that the prescribed dose is 34 Gy on the surface of 1cm from the balloon surface. Results: The attenuation by the pacemaker located at 5 cm distance from the balloon surface was determined to be 21.0% by ion chamber measurements vs. 23.6% by simulations. At 10 cm distance, the attenuation was 15.7% and 17.9%, respectively. In MC simulations, significant dose enhancement over the battery could be at least a factor of 3 at any iodine based contrasts of 0%, 10%, and 25%. A titanium capsule component absorbed more doses by up to 150% but it didn't cause significant dose perturbations on complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) on substrate that is known to be radiation-sensitive. Conclusions: The results from measurements and MC calculations indicate that the actual dose involving a pacemaker is different from one calculated in a homogeneous water condition of treatment planning system.

Journal Article,E. Swanson,2015.0,Safety of vertical augmentation-mastopexy: prospective evaluation of breast perfusion using laser fluorescence imaging,10.1093/asj/sjv086,"BACKGROUND: Augmentation-mastopexy is often recommended to simultaneously correct breast ptosis and restore upper pole fullness. However, some investigators believe that this procedural combination increases risk and recommend staging the surgery for some patients. OBJECTIVES: This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the blood supply of the breast and, specifically, the nipples and areolae to determine whether breast implants inserted at the time of a vertical mastopexy compromise blood supply. METHODS: The SPY Elite Intraoperative Perfusion Assessment System was used to provide objective measurements of skin perfusion during surgery. To avoid confounding variables, patients served as their own controls. Twenty-five women (50 breasts) meeting the inclusion criteria (inclusion rate: 96%) were studied. All patients underwent bilateral vertical augmentation-mastopexies using a medial pedicle. No surgery was staged. The mean implant volume was 360 cc (range, 180-575 cc). The breasts were imaged in surgery after completion of bilateral mastopexies with insertion of (unfilled) saline breast implants and a second time after inflation of the implants. RESULTS: Complications included 1 distal deep venous thrombosis, 1 infection, 1 partial areola necrosis, and 1 case of delayed wound healing. There was no significant difference (P < .01) in intraoperative perfusion measurements comparing absolute and relative values before and after breast implant inflation (saline-filled implants) or insertion (silicone gel implants), including 5 patients undergoing secondary mastopexies. CONCLUSIONS: The insertion of breast implants at the time of a vertical mammaplasty with a medial pedicle does not significantly reduce perfusion of nipple/areola complexes.

Methods: Two-hundred forty three (243) subjects were treated at seventeen (17) US hospitals. Upon meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients underwent partial mastectomy, placement of a balloon applicator suitable to the surgical bed in the lumpectomy cavity and inflated with saline (30 - 75 cc). The skin was temporarily closed over the balloon and ultrasound examination performed to confirm that the balloon surface-to-skin distance was > 1.0 cm. A single fraction of intra-operative radiation therapy was delivered to the lumpectomy cavity using the Xoft System. The prescribed dose was 20 Gy at the balloon applicator surface, and the mean treatment time was 10.2 minutes. After treatment, the balloon was deflated and removed, and skin sutured. Results: Two-hundred forty two (242) subjects received the prescribed dose of 20 Gy; one subject received 21 Gy. Eighteen (18) subjects were removed from the primary analysis post-IORT due to positive surgical margins (N=2), positive sentinel lymph nodes (N=13), or balloon surface-to-skin distance < 1 cm (N=3). However, these eighteen subjects will continue to be followed for the duration of this 10-year study. The mean follow-up for the two-hundred twenty five evaluable subjects is 494 days (range 300-465 days). The mean patient age was 65 years (41-89). Forty-nine subjects (21.8%) had ductal carcinoma in situ, one-hundred seventy one (76%) had invasive ductal carcinoma, and five (2.2%) had unknown histology. The DCIS nuclear grade was evenly distributed between high (N=18) and low/intermediate (N=23); 5 were unknown. Invasive cancer was Grade 1-2 in 142/171 cases. Two-hundred twelve subjects (94.2%) had T1 lesions, eight (3.6%) had T2 lesions, and five (2.2%) were unknown. The mean tumor size was 10.6 mm +/- 6.4 mm. At the time of the last subject visit, 49/318 reported adverse events were Grade 2 or higher, and only 1/100 had serious side effects, i.e. infection. One patient died of aortic aneurism and two developed secondary malignancies, i.e. ovarian cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The most frequent side effects were seroma (12.5%), erythema (9.1%), and induration (7.5%). Cosmesis was excellent to good in 95% of cases.

The patient was treated with a simple mass excision. Three years after the excision, the patient presented with uterine bleeding. A total abdominal hysterectomy was advised. Intraoperative histologic consultation showed a poorly differentiated tumor on the surface of the left ovary. After extensive immunohistochemistry analysis and after reviewing the histology slides from the primary tumor, the final diagnosis was concluded to be recurrent FATWO on the surface of the ovary. C-kit immunohistochemistry was found to be strongly positive. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of C-kit genes on exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and of PDGFR gene on exons 12 and 18 showed no mutational changes. Owing to the limited options in treating recurrent disease and the lack of prognostic factors for recurrence or metastasis, the patient was started on 400 mg of imatinib mesylate therapy for 6 months. In addition, the patient is undergoing continuous follow-up by computed tomographic imaging every 6 months. As chemotherapy and radiation therapy for recurrent or metastatic FATWO are most often unsuccessful, a molecular targeted therapy, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could be considered.

METHODS: We reviewed our breast cancer database to identify all patients who underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy for IBTR and whose primary tumor had been managed by BCS, SLN biopsy and/or axillary node dissection, and adjuvant breast irradiation. RESULTS: Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy identified migration to the regional nodal drainage basins in 11 (73%) of 15 patients, as follows: 5 ipsilateral axillary, 1 supraclavicular, 2 internal mammary, 2 interpectoral, and 3 contralateral axillary. Two patients demonstrated drainage to two nodal basins. In four patients, no drainage was observed. Intraoperative LM with radioisotope plus blue dye identified at least 1 SLN in 11 of 14 patients, and histopathologic evaluation revealed metastasis in 3 patients (2 contralateral axillary and 1 ipsilateral axillary). During preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, the radiocolloid migration time tended to be longer and the drainage pathways more variable than those associated with primary tumors. CONCLUSIONS: LM/SLN biopsy can be successfully performed in patients with IBTR after prior BCS, axillary surgical staging, and adjuvant radiation.

Material and Methods: In vivo dosimetry (DIV) was performed in 63 patients (pts) with two EBT3TM gafchromic films. The first (D1, 2 x 2 cm<sup>2</sup>) was placed at the SB surface, while the second (D2) on the upper side of the SD (with its same dimension) behind the SB, in order to measure the dose and to check the SD alignment. The SD was fastened between the gland and the pectoralis muscle for all the pts (pts 1 + pts 2) and for the last 31 (pts 2) the position of the SD was also externally verified through two surgical threads. The EBT3 were calibrated with 6 MeV electrons by the mobile accelerator LIACTM (SIT, Aprilia, Italy), and they were read after at least 24 hours with a flatbed scanner (EPSONTM 1000XL) both for calibration and DIV. For the alignment analysis the irradiation area on the film (up to the 20% prescription dose) was compared with the collimator area at the irradiation depth. An evaluation in the high dose region > 85% prescription dose was also performed computing the expected area considering only the 85% of the field dimension at the irradiation depth. Results: The mean difference between D1 measured and expected was 0.6% +/- 5%. For D2, the value was 7.2% +/- 7.0%, due also to the backscatter component. Both in low and high dose regions, the alignment agreement was within 90% of the area for 15 of 32 pts 1, between 90% and 66% of the area for 14, while 3 had a worse result. For pts 2 the agreement was within 90% of the area for 23 of 31 pts, between 90% and 66% of the area for 7 pts and 1 had a worse result. Conclusion: DIV has been important in our IORT treatments to exclude accelerator malfunctioning, dose delivery errors and to evaluate the accuracy of the surgical bed reconstruction. Moreover, film dosimetry has been useful to verify and to improve disk alignment procedure.",,0

Therefore, in this study, the prognostic significance of the type of axillary surgery is analyzed in combination with other known prognostic factors in patients with breast cancer. In a series of 1325 consecutive patients with unilateral breast cancer who underwent SLNB between January 1999 and June 2004 at a single institution, 884 underwent SLNB alone following an intraoperative negative histologic investigation and 441 underwent ALND. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed to correlate with clinicopathologic features and treatment methods using both univariate and multivariate analyses Cox proportional hazard regression models. With a median follow-up period of 31 months, 29 (3.3%) and 37 (8.4%) patients relapsed after SLNB alone and ALND, respectively. Tumor size (Tis, T1-2 versus T3-4), histologic nodal involvement (negative versus positive), nuclear grade (NG) (1, 2 versus 3), lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) (absent, weak versus intense), estrogen receptor (ER) status (positive versus negative), type of axillary surgery (SLNB alone versus ALND), type of breast surgery (partial versus total mastectomy), and radiation therapy (yes versus no) significantly correlated with DFS by univariate analysis, demonstrating better DFS in the former category than the latter for each variable. The multivariate analysis revealed that NG, LVI, ER status, and radiation therapy significantly correlated with DFS, and ER and histologic nodal involvement correlated with OS. As the type of axillary surgery had no impact on the prognosis of patients with breast cancer, a SLNB alone is safe as determined by a negative histologic investigation.",eng,0

Higashi,2002.0,Sentinel lymph node biopsy without axillary dissection after an intraoperative negative histological investigation in 358 invasive breast cancer cases,", ","BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an important treatment option for breast cancer patients, as it can accurately predict axillary status. Our previous study using dye with or without radioisotope showed the accuracy and sensitivity of SLNB to be 97% and 94%, respectively. Based on these results, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was eliminated starting in January, 1999 in patients with intraoperatively negative SLNB at our institution. The present study shows the results and outcomes of SLNB as a sole procedure for patients with invasive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three-hundred-fifty-four patients and 358 cases of invasive breast cancer (4 bilateral breast carcinoma) treated with SLNB alone after an intraoperative negative SLNB were studied prospectively from January 1999 to December 2001. RESULTS: The number of the identified SLNs per case ranged from 1 to 8 (mean, 2.5). Of a total of 358 cases, 297 (83%) were treated with hormone therapy and/or chemotherapy, and 281 (78%) were treated with radiotherapy to the conserved breast (50 Gy+/-10 Gy boost), the axilla (50 Gy), or the both sites. After a median follow-up of 21 (range 6-42) months, no patient developed an axillary relapse. Four cases initially recurred in distant organs and one case in the conserved breast. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that an intraoperative negative SLNB without further ALND may be a safe procedure when strict SLNB is performed. To better assess the safety, however, may require longer follow-up.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Virtual simulation and computed tomography planning were used to reconstruct the megavoltage and electron regimens. Manual planning was used for the orthovoltage and brachytherapy regimens. Several sources of variability associated with the dose estimates were assessed. RESULTS: Breast or chest wall RT resulted in whole heart doses of 0.9-14 Gy for left-sided and of 0.4-6 Gy for right-sided irradiation. Internal mammary chain RT delivered heart doses of 3-17 Gy and 2-10 Gy for left- and right-sided irradiation, respectively. For most regimens, the dose to the left anterior descending coronary artery was greater than the heart dose. Scar boost, supraclavicular fossa, and axillary RT delivered mean cardiac doses of <or=3 Gy. The greatest source of variability in estimating dose from a given regimen was patient anatomy. CONCLUSION: For most techniques, the greatest radiation doses were received by the anterior part of the heart and the left anterior descending coronary artery, a common site of atherosclerosis causing myocardial infarction. Irradiation of these structures might have contributed to the excess risk of death from heart disease seen after some past breast cancer RT regimens.",eng,0

Rush,1995.0,Factors influencing cosmetic results after conservation therapy for breast cancer,10.1016/0360-3016(94)00480-3,"PURPOSE: Host, tumor, and treatment-related factors influencing cosmetic outcome are analyzed for patients receiving breast conservation treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four-hundred and fifty-eight patients with evaluable records for cosmesis evaluation, a subset of 701 patients treated for invasive breast cancer with conservation technique between 1969 and 1990, were prospectively analyzed. In 243 patients, cosmetic evaluation was not adequately recorded. Cosmesis evaluation was carried out from 3.7 months to 22.3 years, median of 4.4 years. By pathologic stage, tumors were 62% T1N0, 14% T1N1, 15%, T2N0, and 9% T2N1. The majority of patients were treated with 4-6 MV photons. Cosmetic evaluation was rated by both patient and physician every 4-6 months. A logistic regression analysis was completed using a stepwise logistic regression. P-values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. Excellent cosmetic scores were used in all statistical analyses unless otherwise specified. RESULTS: At most recent follow-up, 87% of patients and 81% of physicians scored their cosmetic outcome as excellent or good. Eighty-two percent of physician and patient evaluations agreed with excellent-good vs. fair-poor rating categories. Analysis demonstrated a lower proportion of excellent cosmetic scores when related to patient age > 60 years (p = 0.001), postmenopausal status (p = 0.02), black race (p = 0.0034), and T2 tumor size (p = 0.05). Surgical factors of importance were: volume of resection > 100 cm3 (p = 0.0001), scar orientation compliance with the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) guidelines (p = 0.0034), and > 20 cm2 skin resected (p = 0.0452). Extent of axillary surgery did not significantly affect breast cosmesis. Radiation factors affecting cosmesis included treatment volume (tangential breast fields only vs. three or more fields) (p = 0.034), whole breast dose in excess of 50 Gy (p = 0.0243), and total dose to tumor site > 65 Gy (p = 0.06), as well as optimum dose distribution with compensating filters (p = 0.002). Daily fraction size of 1.8 Gy vs. 2.0 Gy, boost vs. no boost, type of boost (brachytherapy vs. electrons), total radiation dose, and use of bolus were not significant factors. Use of concomitant chemotherapy with irradiation impaired excellent cosmetic outcome (p = 0.02). Use of sequential chemotherapy or adjuvant tamoxifen did not appear to diminish excellent cosmetic outcomes (p = 0.31). Logistic regression for excellent cosmetic outcome analysis was completed for age, tumor size, menopausal status, race, type of surgery, volume of breast tissue resected, scar orientations, whole breast radiation dose, total radiation dose, number of radiation fields treated, and use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Significant independent factors for excellent cosmetic outcome were: volume of tissue resected (p = 0.0001), type of surgery (p = 0.0001), breast radiation dose (p = 0.005), race (p = 0.002), and age (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Satisfactory cosmesis was recorded in 81% of patients. Impaired cosmetic results are more likely with improper orientation of tylectomy and axillary incisions, larger volume of breast resection, radiation dose to the entire breast in excess of 50.0 Gy, and concurrent administration of chemotherapy. Careful selection of treatment procedures for specific patients/tumors and refinement in surgical/irradiation techniques will enhance the cosmetic results in breast conservation therapy.",eng,0
Journal Article,C. L. Temple; E. A. Strom; A. Youssef; H. N. Langstein,2005.0,Choice of recipient vessels in delayed TRAM flap breast reconstruction after radiotherapy,", ","This study compared the use of the internal mammary and thoracodorsal recipient vessels in a uniform group of patients who underwent delayed TRAM flap reconstruction after radiotherapy, focusing on usability rates and outcomes. The authors identified 123 delayed TRAM flap patients who had undergone postmastectomy radiotherapy from a prospective database (1990 to 2001). Recipient vessel unusability rates were calculated on the basis of reports of inspection of a vessel, either by direct intraoperative dissection or by findings from color Doppler examination (internal mammary vessels only). Charts were reviewed for outcomes including flap loss, vascular complications, fat necrosis, and lymphedema; t-test and chi-square analyses were performed to compare outcomes and unusability rates, and multiple regression analysis was performed to determine factors influencing outcome. Of the 123 planned free TRAM flaps, 106 were completed as free flaps and 17 were performed as pedicled flaps because of unusable recipient vessels. Of the free flaps, 45 were anastomosed to the internal mammary vessels, 55 to the thoracodorsal vessels, and six to other vessels. The internal mammary and thoracodorsal groups did not differ significantly in body mass index, abdominal scars, smoking history, time delay between irradiation and TRAM flap reconstruction, or flap ischemia time. Radiation doses to the axilla (thoracodorsal), internal mammary chain, and supraclavicular fossa were similar between the groups. The internal mammary vessels were rejected in 11 (20 percent) of 56 cases, and the thoracodorsal vessels were rejected in 19 (26 percent) of 74 cases (p = 0.42). In cases with unusable internal mammary vessels, 46 percent (n = 5) had inadequate veins, 27 percent (n = 3) had inadequate arteries, and in 27 percent (n = 3) both vessels were inadequate. In the 19 cases with unusable thoracodorsal vessels, 84 percent (n = 16) were excessively scarred, 11 percent (n = 2) had inadequate vessels, and 5 percent (n = 1) were absent. Outcomes were similar regardless of recipient vessels used (internal mammary versus thoracodorsal): total flap loss, 0 percent versus 4 percent (p = 0.20); vascular complications, 6.7 percent versus 11 percent (p = 0.46); arm lymphedema, 4.4 percent versus 9 percent (p = 0.37); partial flap loss, 9 percent versus 6 percent (p = 0.54); and fat necrosis, 18 percent versus 15 percent (p = 0.69). Multivariate analysis revealed a trend for higher complication rates in smokers and with the use of the thoracodorsal vessels as the recipients. Overall, no discernible unusability or outcome differences were detected between the internal mammary and thoracodorsal groups.",eng,0

Purpose: To review evidence about the benefits and harms of charged-particle radiation therapy for patients with cancer. Data Sources: MEDLINE (inception to 11 July 2009) was searched for publications in English, German, French, Italian, and Japanese. Web sites of manufacturers, treatment centers, and professional organizations were searched for relevant information. Study Selection: Four reviewers identified studies of any design that described clinical outcomes or adverse events in 10 or more patients with cancer treated with charged-particle radiation therapy. Data Extraction: The 4 reviewers extracted study, patient, and treatment characteristics; clinical outcomes; and adverse events for nonoverlapping sets of articles. A fifth reviewer verified data on comparative studies. Data Synthesis: Currently, 7 centers in the United States have facilities for particle (proton)-beam irradiation, and at least 4 are under construction, each costing between $100 and $225 million. In 243 eligible articles, charged-particle radiation therapy was used alone or in combination with other interventions for common (for example, lung, prostate, or breast) or uncommon (for example, skull-base tumors or uveal melanomas) types of cancer. Of 243 articles, 185 were single-group retrospective studies. Eight randomized and 9 nonrandomized clinical trials compared treatments with or without charged particles. No comparative study reported statistically significant or important differences in overall or cancerspecific survival or in total serious adverse events. Limitation: Few studies directly compared treatments with or without particle irradiation. Conclusion: Evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of charged-particle radiation therapy in cancer is needed to assess the benefits, risks, and costs of treatment alternatives.

Two important contributions are the use of whole-breast hypofractionation and accelerated partial-breast irradiation. Three large randomized trials comparing whole-breast hypofractionation versus conventional fractionation for early breast cancer have shown similar rates of local recurrence and morbidity. As a result, whole-breast hypofractionation is now an option for selected patients after breast-conserving surgery. The delivery of accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) has been studied using techniques of multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, balloon-based brachytherapy, external-beam radiotherapy, and intraoperative radiotherapy. Multiple single and multi-institutional data have been published indicating good long-term results with APBI (in highly selected, low-risk patients) in terms of tumor control and toxicity. However, the long-term results of large, phase III trials comparing APBI with whole-breast irradiation are still pending. © 2011.",,0

Surgical excision of cancer often is confronted with difficulties in the identification of cancer spread and the accurate delineation of tumor margins. Currently, the assessment of tumor borders is afforded by postoperative pathology or, less reliably, intraoperative frozen sectioning. Fluorescence imaging is a natural modality for intraoperative use by directly relating to the surgeon's vision and offers highly attractive characteristics, such as high-resolution, sensitivity, and portability. Via the use of targeted probes it also becomes highly tumor-specific and can lead to significant improvements in surgical procedures and outcome. METHODS: Mice bearing xenograft human tumors were injected with alphavbeta3-integrin receptor-targeted fluorescent probe and in vivo visualized by using a novel, real-time, multispectral fluorescence imaging system. Confirmatory ex vivo imaging, bioluminescence imaging, and histopathology were used to validate the in vivo findings. RESULTS: Fluorescence images were all in good correspondence with the confirming bioluminescence images in respect to signal colocalization. Fluorescence imaging detected all tumors and successfully guided total tumor excision by effectively detecting small tumor residuals, which occasionally were missed by the surgeon. Tumor tissue exhibited target-to-background ratio of ~4.0, which was significantly higher compared with white-light images representing the visual contrast. Histopathology confirmed the capability of the method to identify tumor negative margins with high specificity and better prediction rate compared with visual inspection. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time multispectral fluorescence imaging using tumor specific molecular probes is a promising modality for tumor excision by offering real time feedback to the surgeon in the operating room.",eng,0

A positive margin is still one of the strongest predictor for risk of local recurrence of intraductal and invasive breast cancer. Intraoperative margin assessment of DCIS is difficult and existing options are unsatisfying. Aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of MarginProbe(Dune Medical Devices, Boston, MA, USA) in assessing surgical margins for DCIS and the contribution to lowering the re-excision rate after initial BCS. Material and methods: The device includes a disposable hand-held probe and a console, is based on radiofrequency spectroscopy, and detects differences in dielectric properties between normal and malignant breast tissue. The multicentre single arm, post market study was performed on 55 patients at 3 German sites under approval of institutional review boards. MarginProbe was used as an adjunctive tool to the current practice. All specimens were sent for paraffin embedded pathological analysis. The procedure success was defined as both: negative margins after initial BCS; and early identification of an extended lesion, with conversion to mastectomy instead of performing a re-excision BCS. Results: From September 2009-May 2010, 42/55 patients were eligible for this analysis. In comparison with a historical re-excision rate of 39% for DCIS patients undergoing BCS, use of MarginProbe led to a reduction of the re-excision rate by 56%, down to 17% (p = 0.018) (surgical margin width of 5 mm). The procedure success was also significantly improved by more than 3-fold (p<0.0001), from 14% (6/42) by standard of care (SOC) alone, to 57% (24/42) with use of the device. In 21% (9/42) of the cases use of the device led to a direct conversion to mastectomy due to extensive disease identified, sparing an additional re-excision BCS. Resected average main specimen tissue volume was 34.6 cc. Tissue volume associated with false positive margins was, on average, 7.5 cc per patient. Cosmetic outcomes were not different. Discussion: In synopsis with the other two clinical trials (MAST and US pivotal study) we found our data consistent. Each trial reported a reduction of the re-resection rate by more than 50%. Our results demonstrate that adjunctive use of the device is effective in achieving procedure success and reducing re-excisions for DCIS patients. Several options for intraoperative margin assessment exist, but for DCIS they are time-consuming and insufficient (frozen section, touch prep cytology) or experimental (near-infrared fluorescence optical imaging, high-frequency ultrasound). Usually, the pathologist provides final analysis of the lesion extension and margin assessment several days after operation. Conclusion: MarginProbe is a device that provides a fast and effective technique for intraoperative margin assessment that is already used in daily routine. It lowers the re-excision rate for both DCIS and invasive cancer significantly, by >50%, without any influence on patient's cosmesis. It may allow the surgeon to perform oncoplastic or reconstructive breast surgery and IORT more safely in the future.",,0

We therefore felt that restricting the radiation therapy to the tumour bed might be adequate in selected patients with early breast cancer, with the potential advantage that it might be possible to deliver this form of targeted irradiation as a single intra-operative treatment during the definitive surgical excision, under the same general anaesthetic. This approach would potentially have significant benefits both for patients and also for healthcare systems. Methods: Having safely piloted the new technique of single dose targeted intra-operative radiotherapy (TARGIT) using Intrabeam [first patient treated at UCH in 1998 and pilot study published 2001], we launched the TARGIT-A trial (www.thelancet.com/protocol-reviews/99PRT-47) on 24 March 2000. Female patients > = 45 years with localised invasive ductal breast carcinoma suitable for breast conserving surgery were randomly allocated to receive either TARGIT (i.e ""Single-shot"" intra-operative radiotherapy), or whole breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Postoperative discovery of predefined factors (e.g., lobular carcinoma) could trigger addition of EBRT to TARGIT, which proved necessary, in the opinion of the supervising team, in about 15% of cases. In other words, in about 85% of patients randomly allocated to the TARGIT arm, no additional EBRT was given. The primary outcome measure of the study, analysed by intention-to-treat, was a non-inferiority margin (2.5%) of local recurrence in the conserved breast. Patients could be treated by TARGIT at the definitive surgical procedure (""pre-pathology group"") or after histological assessment of the excised specimen (""post-pathology group""). Either of these pre-defined policies was acceptable within the trial protocol. Findings: 2232 patients were randomized from 28 international centres over 10 years. The study has enough patients with a median follow up of more than 4 years to detect the original non-inferiority margin of 2.5% with an 80% power and 95% confidence. Median age was 63 yrs (IQR 57-69), median tumour size 12mm (IQR 9-18mm), lymph node involvement 17% +ve. The overall number of complications and major toxicity (37/1113 TARGIT vs. 44/1119 EBRT, p = 0.44) were equivalent, but radiotherapy toxicity (RTOG grade 3) was lower in the TARGIT group: 6 vs. 23 (p = 0.004). The combined surgical-TARGIT treatment added approx 40 min to the overall operative time, but avoided 15-25 visits (more, in some centres) for treatment, preceded by at least one visit for radiotherapy treatment planning. At a follow-up period of 4 years, there was no significant difference in the Kaplan-Meier estimate of local recurrence in the conserved breast between TARGIT and EBRT [1.2% (95%CI 0.53-2.71) vs. 0.95 (95%CI 0.39-2.3), p = 0.41]. Interpretation: The TARGIT approach is safe. Local recurrence with single dose TARGIT is comparable to EBRT delivered over several weeks in this selected group of patients, at a 4-yr follow-up. Most patients did not require additional EBRT. Long term follow-up is obviously essential, and will continue. We regard these initial results as extremely encouraging, particularly since breast cancer is such a common condition that this single diagnosis constitutes a substantial portion of the workload of most radiotherapy departments.""",,0

Personalization of loco-regional treatment is integral to optimization of breast cancer care. Clinical and pathological tumor stage, biological features and host factors influence loco-regional treatment strategies and extent of surgical procedures. Key issues including axillary staging, axillary treatment, radiation therapy, primary systemic therapy (PST), preoperative hormonal therapy and genetic predisposition were identified and discussed at the Kyoto Breast Cancer Consensus Conference (KBCCC2014). In the first of a two part conference scene, consensus recommendations for axillary management are presented and focus on the following topics: indications for completion axillary lymph node dissection in primary surgical patients with </=2 macrometastases or any sentinel nodal deposits after PST; the timing of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the context of PST; use of axillary irradiation as a component of primary treatment plans and the role of intraoperative node assessment in the post-Z0011 era.",eng,0

Here, we highlight the major topics discussed at the conference and propose ideas for future studies. Regarding axillary management, we examined three major issues. First, we discussed whether the use of axillary reverse mapping could clarify the lymphatic system of breast and whether the ipsilateral arm might help avoid lymphedema. Second, the use of an indocyanine green fluorescent navigation system was discussed for intraoperative lymphatic mapping. These new issues should be examined further in practice. Finally, some agreement was reached on the importance of four-node diagnosis"" to aid in the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel nodes. Regarding breast treatment, there was general agreement that the clinical value of surgical margins in predicting local failure was dependent on the tumor's intrinsic biology and subtypes. For patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy, less extensive excision may be feasible in those who respond to systemic therapy in an acceptable manner. Most trials of preoperative chemotherapy lack outcome data on local recurrence. Therefore, there is a need for such data for overview analysis. We also agreed that radiation after mastectomy may be beneficial in node-positive cases where more than four nodes are involved. Throughout the discussions for both invasive and noninvasive disease, the investigation of nomograms was justified for major issues in the decision-making process, such as the presence or absence of microinvasion and the involvement of nonsentinel nodes in sentinel node-positive patients.""",eng,0

Methods and Materials: Data from 32 patients at two sites were reviewed. Variables analyzed included the seroma fluid (SF):air volume around the MLB before and after vacuum port use and on its ability to improve (1) the eligibility of patients for APBI and (2) dose coverage of the planning target volume for evaluation (PTV_EVAL) in eligible patients. Results: The median SF/air volume before vacuum removal was 6.8. cc vs. 0.8. cc after vacuum removal (median reduction in SF/air volume was 90.5%). Before vacuum port use, the median SF/air volume expressed as percentage of the PTV_EVAL was 7.8% (range, 1.9-26.6) in all patients. After application of the vacuum, this was reduced to 1.2%. Before vacuum port use, 10 (31.3%) patients were not considered acceptable candidates for APBI because the SF/air volume:PTV_EVAL ratio (SF:PTV) was greater than 10% (range, 10.1-26.6%; median, 15.2%). After vacuum port use, the median SF:PTV ratio was 1.6% for a median reduction of 91.5%. In addition, the percentage of the prescribed dose covering greater than or equal to 90% of the PTV_EVAL proportionally increased a median of 8% (range, 3-10%) in eligible patients. Conclusion: Use of the Contura MLB vacuum port significantly improved the conformity of the target tissue to the balloon surface, leading to reproducible dose delivery and increased target volume coverage. In addition, application of the vacuum allowed the safe treatment of unacceptable patients with APBI. © 2011 American Brachytherapy Society.",,0

They had typical features of PJS: family history of autosomal dominant inheritance, mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation, and numerous hamartomatous polyps in the large and small bowel. An older brother developed locally advanced pancreatic head cancer (poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) and underwent intraoperative radiotherapy in 46 years old. However, he died of exacerbation of the cancer 1 year later. A sister developed 3-cm-sized pancreatic tail cancer (poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) and underwent distal pancreatectomy in 57 years old. At present, she is alive 3 months after the operation. Patients with PJS have a greater risk of developing several carcinomas at a relatively younger age. Frequent associated carcinomas are gastrointestinal, gynecologic, lung, breast and pancreas cancer. They have a greater than 132-fold increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer and the lifetime risk of the pancreas cancer is about 36 percent by age 60.

Over the last 10 years, intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT) has been used extensively in clinical trials but has yet to make a significant clinical impact on current breast cancer management strategies. There are currently two devices that fit the category of electronic brachytherapy. The Axxent Electronic Brachytherapy System (Xoft Inc., Fremont, CA) using lowenergy radiation at a high dose rate and the Zeiss Intrabeam (Carl Zeiss Surgical Gmbh, Oberkochen, Germany) amobile photon radiation system that procures a miniature electron beam driven X-ray source. Purpose.We present our experience at Hospital de La Mancha Centro with IORT in selected patients using the Zeiss INTRABEAM system. Materials and methods. We have analyzed 15 patients across from May to December 2011. Depending on clinical characteristics, two groups of patients were treated either to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) or a BOOST followed by whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT). Main inclusion criteria for APBI patients were: (a) signature of informed consent; (b) indication for breast conservative surgery; (c) age>60 years; (d) histology: CDI or other favourable histology; (e) unicentric and unifocal tumor; (f) negative margins (>2 mm); (g) sentinel lymph node negative; (h) ER negative; (i) WBRT contraindicated. Patients unsuitable for APBI were offered IORT as boost. Doses administered for APBI and BOOST were 20 Gy and 10-20 Gy, respectively Results. 9 out 15 patientswere derived to APBI and 6 to Boost plusWBRT; however, surgery finally demonstrated that some patients did not meet criteria and finally we did 4 APBI, 10 boost +WBRT and 1 EBRT. In all cases analyzed, the most frequent toxicity associated to the treatment was: seroma, hyperpigmentation, edema and fibrosis. After a minimum follow-up of 12 months (median 24) no local relapses were observed. Conclusions. Although the information was based from an extremely limited source of patients we can conclude that IORT using the Intrabeam System is a suitable treatment for early stage breast cancer in appropriately selected patients according to ASTRO or ASTRO guidelines.",,0

METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 74 consecutive patients who received the Symmetry Bypass System aortic connector at the time of CABG. A total of 131 of 144 proximal vein graft anastomoses were performed with this device. The left internal mammary artery was used in 62 patients, and 61 patients had off-pump"" coronary revascularization. A total of 11 patients were readmitted with chest pain consistent with unstable angina 173+/-39 days after CABG. Five of the 11 patients had previous in-stent restenosis before CABG. At angiography, 20 saphenous vein bypass grafts containing 19 connectors were found to have severe stenosis (n=12) or occlusion (n=6) and were treated with angioplasty and stenting or medical therapy. Seven of 11 patients were readmitted 76+/-11 days later with recurrent chest pain and were found to have severe stenosis at the previously stented connector site.

A drawback to IORT compared with postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy is that it is not performed using image guidance. Our aim was to report on how our institution's unique IORT workflow integrates CT image guidance and how these CT images were used intraoperatively to change applicator positioning. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the first 29 patients who participated in a prospective clinical trial of breast IORT at our institution. All patients underwent lumpectomy, multicatheter balloon placement, intraoperative CT scan, and high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment delivery to 12.5 Gy to 1 cm from the balloon surface. This report focuses on the intraoperative CT findings that led to clinical changes, followed by repeat CT for IORT treatment planning. Results: After initial intraoperative CT, 7 patients underwent an additional intraoperative CT scan (24.1%). In 6 patients, the initial intraoperative CT scan identified large air cavities and/or poor tissue conformity. This defect could be improved in all patients with adjustment of the balloon applicator before planning and delivering IORT. Intraoperative CT scan was used in one patient to localize a biopsy clip and aided in excision to negative margin. Conclusions: In our study, intraoperative CT identifies actionable findings in breast IORT, including residual tumor or errors in applicator positioning, in almost 25% of patients. Clinical results of the described trial will serve to further validate this image-guided approach to IORT. Copyright © 2015 American Brachytherapy Society.",,0

Methods and Materials: Between March 2004 and June 2012, 18 patients previously treated with external beam radiotherapy were retreated using either the MammoSite (Hologic Corporation, Marlborough, MA), MammoSite ML (Hologic Corporation), or the Contura (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc., Tempe, AZ) brachytherapy devices. Sixteen patients were treated for an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after breast conservation surgery and postoperative irradiation (11 with infiltrating ductal carcinoma [IDC] and 6 with ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]), whereas 2 patients developed an in-field breast cancer likely associated with Hodgkin disease mantle irradiation (27 and 17years prior, respectively). The recurrent histology of seven was IDC, with seven others recurring as DCIS, three as a combination of IDC/DCIS, and one as infiltrating lobular carcinoma. All patients received a twice-daily tumor dose of 3400cGy at 340cGy per fraction. Acute and chronic side effects were graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Cosmesis was graded by both the Harvard Cosmesis Scale and the Allegheny General Modification of the Harvard Scale. Results: With a mean of followup of 39.6months, only 2 patients developed a local recurrence. One patient developed an inflammatory recurrence from what was identified as a moderately differentiated T1N0M0 estrogen receptor-positive recurrence, and the second developed a recurrence immediately adjacent to the implant site. Both patients were treated locally by salvage mastectomy. The patient who developed an inflammatory recurrence rapidly developed visceral metastases including brain lesions and succumbed to her progressive disease. The second patient was successfully salvaged with uncomplicated mastectomy, and she survives to this date. One patient developed a chronic abscess in the sinus tract of the balloon, which required mastectomy, and one developed a post-treatment infection in the catheter tract, which was successfully treated with oral antibiotics. Cosmesis as graded by the Harvard cosmesis criteria and the Allegheny General Modification Score diminished one grade in only 2 patients. All other patients had stable cosmetic scores. Conclusions: Use of balloon brachytherapy devices in the treatment of the previously irradiated breast is feasible and may provide adequate local control and acceptable cosmesis in carefully selected patients. Further study and refinement of this therapy is required for more definitive results. © 2014 American Brachytherapy Society.",,0

Materials and methods: We reviewed the modern literature and correlated it with our extensive experience in retreatment of the breast in patients originally treated with lumpectomy and post-operative irradiation following IBTR. We report the updated results of our patients treated by low dose rate temporary interstitial implant (LDR), high dose rate (HDR) balloon brachytherapy, and three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-D CRT), and compare these to results reported by other authors. Results: A total of 42 patients have been treated on our protocol. With a mean follow up of 67.5 months (range 5-115 months), twenty-one of 22 LDR patients achieved local control at the time of last follow-up, or at the time of their death. The single patient who developed a second local recurrence was treated successfully with mastectomy. One of 15 HDR patients developed an inflammatory recurrence and was successfully treated by salvage mastectomy. All five 3-D CRT patients have retained their breasts. Two LDR patients developed localized skin breakdown. Five of 42 patients have expired with 3/5 succumbing to metastatic breast cancer. One patient died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and one died from cardiac complications secondary to previous mantle radiotherapy. One patient developed a contralateral breast cancer. Long-term cosmetic results as defined by the Harvard cosmesis scale and the Allegheny General (AGH) modification were acceptable, and the AGH modification more accurately reported cosmetic changes. Conclusions: These long-term data suggest that repeat lumpectomy followed by repeat post-operative radiotherapy is feasible and may be an acceptable alternative to salvage mastectomy in patients who develop IBTR following conservation breast therapy. An improved cosmetic reporting system (the AGH modification) is required to more accurately identify post-retreatment cosmesis.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between March 2004 and March 2007, three patients previously treated with external beam radiotherapy were retreated using the MammoSite brachytherapy device. Two patients were treated for an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after breast conservation surgery and postoperative irradiation, whereas the third patient developed an in-field breast cancer likely associated with Hodgkin's disease mantle irradiation 27 years before. The recurrent histology of two was ductal carcinoma in situ ([DCIS] one originally presenting as infiltrating ductal carcinoma [IDC] and the other as DCIS), whereas the Hodgkin's disease patient presented with IDC. All patients received a twice-daily tumor dose of 3400 cGy at 340 cGy/fraction. The mean maximum skin dose was 53.4% (range, 49.5-60.3%) of the prescribed dose. RESULTS: With a mean followup of 32 months, no patient developed a local recurrence. Cosmesis in all three cases as graded by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, cosmesis criteria was excellent (Grade I) in all cases. Dosimetric calculations demonstrated that the device allows for appropriate local irradiation while sparing the previously irradiated skin of the involved breast as defined by the protocol standard.

Materials and Methods: Between January 1998 and April 2008, 26 patients with TIS or T1 breast carcinoma were offered interstitial or intracavitary brachytherapy after lumpectomy in a previously irradiated breast as an alternative to salvage mastectomy. Twenty-five of 26 patients had prior lumpectomy followed by standard postoperative external beam radiotherapy for early stage carcinoma of the breast [dose range 5000-6040 cGy]. One patient developed breast cancer after full mantle irradiation [4500 cGy to the mediastinum and axillae] for Hodgkin Lymphoma 27 years earlier. All tumors were excised with final margins of resection free of disease per National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project definition. After lumpectomy, tumor bed implantation was carried out utilizing a low dose rate interstitial technique in 22 patients, whereas 3 patients were treated with high dose rate brachytherapy using the MammoSite brachytherapy catheter and 1 patient was treated with high dose rate brachytherapy using the Contura catheter. The low dose rate treatment consisted of 4500 to 5000 cGy at 35 to 50 cGy per hour to the tumor bed plus a 1.0 cm margin, whereas the high dose rate treatment consisted of 3400 cGy in twice daily fractions of 340 cGy currently used in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-39. Cosmesis was graded according to the B-39 cosmesis scale for de novo treatments: grade I as excellent, grade II as good, Grade III as fair, and Grade IV as poor. Results: Eighteen patients were scored as grade I, 6 as grade II, and 2 as grade III. No patient received a Grade IV score. All 4 balloon brachytherapy patients were scored as Grade I. Twenty-five of 26 patients remained free of local failure with a median follow-up of 38 months (range 6-75 months). The only patient to develop a second local recurrence was graded as grade I before salvage mastectomy. Two patients developed wound dehiscence after immediate postlumpectomy implantation. Two have succumbed to metastatic breast carcinoma at 17 and 24 months after salvage implant therapy. An additional patient has succumbed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All patients, regardless of cosmesis grade were satisfied with their decision for repeat conservation therapy. Factors affecting cosmesis were distance from the implant to the skin, the type of device used, and the amount of residual breast tissue after repeat lumpectomy. Conclusions: The cosmetic effect of brachytherapy after lumpectomy in the management of recurrent carcinoma of the previously irradiated breast is acceptable in highly selected patients. Intracavitary technique may provide superior cosmetic results for patients retreated with brachytherapy for salvage. Copyright © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,0

Methods and Materials: Thirty-six patients with TIS-T2 breast carcinomas received brachytherapy or 3-D conformal radiotherapy (3-D CRT) after lumpectomy in a previously irradiated breast as an alternative to salvage mastectomy. Brachytherapy consisted of low-dose-rate (LDR) interstitial technique in 21 patients, whereas 11 patients were treated using high-dose-rate (HDR) balloon technique. Four patients received 3-D CRT. Cosmesis was graded according to the Harvard criteria and the Allegheny General Modification of the Harvard criteria. Acute sequelae were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). Results: Thirty-five of 36 patients remained free of local failure, with a mean followup of 37 months. Five patients treated with LDR developed Grade II and two developed Grade III acute side effects. No patient treated with balloon brachytherapy or 3-D CRT developed a Grade II or higher acute effect. Cosmetically, 12 LDR interstitial patients were scored as Grade I, six as Grade II, and three as Grade III. Nine of the HDR patients were scored as Grade I, one as Grade II, and one as Grade III. Two 3-D CRT patients were scored as Grade II and two as Grade III. The Allegheny Modification of the Harvard criteria more accurately reflected the cosmetic effects of re-treatment. Conclusion: Brachytherapy is feasible for patients who desire breast preservation in a previously irradiated breast. All techniques demonstrated similar local control rates.

Materials/Methods: The plans of 109 high dose rate balloon (63 MammoSite and 46 Contura) brachytherapy cases of early breast cancer patients were reviewed to assess skin dose and toxicity. In a review of anatomic literature, the mammary skin thickness ranges from 0.7 to 3.5 mm (mean = 2.0mm). We used the mean skin thickness to construct a volumetric representation of the skin in order to define histographic data related to this organ for standard 3-dimensional treatment planning. The PTV (planning tumor volume) for balloon brachytherapy defined by the NSABP B-39/RTOG-0413 protocol is a 1.0 cm spherical expansion of the balloon. The cases analyzed (n = 46) included only patients whose tumor cavity was <12 mm from the skin so that the PTV intersecting with the skin provided volumetric data. The data were compared to the maximum surface point dose data and correlated with acute dermal toxicity as measured by the CTCAE (v 3.0) criteria. Results: The mean maximum point surface skin dose percent (MSD) for all patients was 101.8% of prescribed (range, 75.8-131.9%) while the mean maximum volume dose percent (MVD) was 114.5% (range, 85.6-157.2). The maximal skin dose was significantly different between MSD and MVD methods (p<0.0001 with Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test) because the maximal dose of the volumetric skin occurs at 2mmcloser to the balloon compared with the maximal point dose at the skin surface. A subset analysis by catheter type demonstrated no significant difference between the MammoSite or Contura applicators in either MSD (Contura, 101%; MammoSite,102.8%) or MVD (Contura, 118.8%; MammoSite, 118%). Five patients developed grade two acute reactions and one developed grade three toxicity. Of these patients, the MSD and MVD were 121.5 % and 144.3 % respectively. The skin surface to balloon distance in all of these patients was 6 mm or less. Overall long term cosmesis was unchanged in all patients. For all 46 patients, the mean maximal skin dose was 101.8% (range, 75.8-131.9) for MVD and 118.8% (range, 85.4 - 157.2) of the prescribed dose for MSD. Conclusions: Histographic volumetric data represent an improved understanding of the relationship to dose and volume in distinction to maximum point dose calculations. As balloon to skin surface distances decrease, volumetric measurements become more important. Quantification of skin volume should be considered in all brachytherapeutic cases to provide a better understanding of the relationship of dose to toxicity.",,0

In our experience, most women desire breast preservation when given the choice. We have found that cosmetic effects from retreatment stabilize between 18-24 months post retirement. We present our results regarding local control and cosmetic outcome following repeat lumpectomy and retreatment irradiation in this cohort of patients. Materials and Methods: Between 3/2004 and 2/2012, eighteen patients previously treated with external beam radiotherapy were retreated utilizing a balloon brachytherapy device. Sixteen patients developed an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence following conservation surgery/radiotherapy (IBTR), while two patients developed an in-field breast cancer likely associated with Hodgkin's disease mantle irradiation 27 and 17 years prior. The recurrent histology of seven patients was ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS), six patients represented with infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC), one with infiltrating lobular carcinoma, and four with a combination of DCIS and IDC. All treatment was delivered in accordance with the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel project (NSABP) B-39 protocol guidelines with patients receiving a tumor dose of 3400 cGy at 340 cGy per fraction delivered twice daily separated by a minimum 6-hour interval. Cosmesis was graded by both the Harvard/NSABP cosmesis criteria as excellent (Grade I), good (Grade II), fair (Grade III), and poor (Grade 4). The Allegheny General Modification (AGHM) of the Harvard scale which uses a pre-irradiation score compared to a post irradiation score was used to more accurately reflect the cosmetic effect of retreatment radiotherapy. Results: With a mean of followup of 27.8 months only a single patient has developed a local recurrence at 44 months post retreatment. Cosmesis in nine cases as graded by the Harvard/NSABP cosmesis criteria was Grade I, Grade II in six cases, and Grade III in three. Seventeen patients had no cosmetic change from the effects of the radiotherapy. Only one patient had a cosmetic downgrade due to the effects of the radiotherapeutic component, which downgraded the cosmesis from Grade II to Grade III following radiotherapy retreatment which was better reflected in the Modification score (AGHM 2-3). Conclusions: Repeat lumpectomy and balloon brachytherapy reirradiation in the treatment of the previously irradiated breast is feasible and yields acceptable cosmesis. The Allegheny General Modification of the Harvard/ NSABP cosmesis scale is a better and more accurate representation of the effects of retreatment irradiation.",,0

The FLARE imaging system overcomes this major obstacle. METHODS: Color video was acquired simultaneously, and in real-time, along with two independent channels of NIR fluorescence. Grayscale NIR fluorescence images were converted to visible pseudo-colors"" and overlaid onto the color video image. Yorkshire pigs weighing 35 kg (n = 5) were used for final preclinical validation of the imaging system. A six-patient pilot study was conducted in women undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for breast cancer. Subjects received (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid lymphoscintigraphy. In addition, 12.5 microg of indocyanine green (ICG) diluted in human serum albumin (HSA) was used as an NIR fluorescent lymphatic tracer. RESULTS: The FLARE system permitted facile positioning in the operating room. NIR light did not change the look of the surgical field. Simultaneous pan-lymphatic and SLN mapping was demonstrated in swine using clinically available NIR fluorophores and the dual NIR capabilities of the system. In the pilot clinical trial, a total of nine SLNs were identified by (99m)Tc- lymphoscintigraphy and nine SLNs were identified by NIR fluorescence, although results differed in two patients. No adverse events were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the successful clinical translation of a new NIR fluorescence imaging system for image-guided oncologic surgery.""",eng,0

Vahrmeijer,2014.0,Real-time intraoperative detection of breast cancer using near-infrared fluorescence imaging and Methylene Blue,10.1016/j.ejso.2014.02.225,"BACKGROUND: Despite recent developments in preoperative breast cancer imaging, intraoperative localization of tumor tissue can be challenging, resulting in tumor-positive resection margins during breast conserving surgery. Based on certain physicochemical similarities between Technetium((99m)Tc)-sestamibi (MIBI), an SPECT radiodiagnostic with a sensitivity of 83-90% to detect breast cancer preoperatively, and the near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore Methylene Blue (MB), we hypothesized that MB might detect breast cancer intraoperatively using NIR fluorescence imaging. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with breast cancer, planned for surgical resection, were included. Patients were divided in 2 administration groups, which differed with respect to the timing of MB administration. N = 12 patients per group were administered 1.0 mg/kg MB intravenously either immediately or 3 h before surgery. The mini-FLARE imaging system was used to identify the NIR fluorescent signal during surgery and on post-resected specimens transferred to the pathology department. Results were confirmed by NIR fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: 20/24 (83%) of breast tumors (carcinoma in N = 21 and ductal carcinoma in situ in N = 3) were identified in the resected specimen using NIR fluorescence imaging. Patients with non-detectable tumors were significantly older. No significant relation to receptor status or tumor grade was seen. Overall tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) was 2.4 +/- 0.8. There was no significant difference between TBR and background signal between administration groups. In 2/4 patients with positive resection margins, breast cancer tissue identified in the wound bed during surgery would have changed surgical management. Histology confirmed the concordance of fluorescence signal and tumor tissue. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study demonstrated an overall breast cancer identification rate using MB of 83%, with real-time intraoperative guidance having the potential to alter patient management.",eng,0

METHODS: Four surgeons (3 hand attending surgeons and 1 hand fellow) monitored their radiation exposure for a total of 200 consecutive cases (50 cases per surgeon) requiring mini C-arm fluoroscopy. Each surgeon measured radiation exposure with a badge dosimeter placed on the outside breast pocket of the lead apron (external whole body exposure), a second badge dosimeter under the lead apron (shielded whole body exposure), and a ring dosimeter (hand exposure). RESULTS: Completed records were noted in 198 cases, with an average fluoroscopy time of 133.52 seconds and average cumulative dose of 19,260 rem-cm(2) per case. The total measured radiation exposures for the (1) external whole body exposure dosimeters were 16 mrem (for shallow depth), 7 mrem (for eye depth), and less than 1 mrem (for deep depth); (2) shielded whole body badge dosimeters recorded less than 1 mrem; and (3) ring dosimeters totaled 170 mrem. The total radial exposure for 4 ring dosimeters that had registered a threshold of 30 mrem or more of radiation exposure was 170 mrem at the skin level, for an average of 42.5 mrem per dosimeter ring or 6.3 mrem per case. CONCLUSIONS: This study of whole body and hand radiation exposure from the mini C-arm includes the largest number of surgical cases in the published literature. The measured whole body and hand radiation exposure received by the hand surgeon from the mini C-arm represents a minimal risk of radiation, based on the current National Council on Radiation Protection and Management standards of annual dose limits (5,000 mrem per year for whole body and 50,000 mrem per year to the extremities).",eng,0

Most often, IOERT treatment plan is the result of a sequence of manually handled actions, including collimator and radio protection device positioning.

Contrary to other radiotherapy techniques with complex treatment plans, such as IMRT, Treatment Planning Systems (TPS) are not yet routinely employed in IOERT. Recently the only one TPS available for IOERT has been extended with Monte Carlo (MC) dose plan capabilities. Treatment parameters can be optimized from a patient CT image data by calculating dose distribution histograms either with a pencil beam algorithm or a fast MC method. The purpose of this work is to compare the fast MC algorithm employed in the commercial TPS with the dose predicted by a validated GEANT4, in an advanced example. Materials and Methods: Dose distributions obtained with the TPS were compared with those obtained with a GEANT4 - based application. The GEANT4 application has been validated against experimental measurements, and it has been considered as the reference. The standard setup considered is: a 60mm O perspex applicator, a 10 MeV electron beam, a water phantom, and a metal disc inside the water phantom to simulate a radio protection issue. Percental Depth Dose (PDD) and Lateral Dose (LD) distributions were compared in water. Back Scattering Factors (BSF), defined as the ratio of PDD values with and without shielding disc at the same depth, were estimated for two cases employing the shielding disc in equivalent positions: the first one using a shielding disc of 4 mm thickness of homogeneous material (aluminum, copper, silver, lead), 80 mm diameter; the second one using a double-layer shielding disc made by 2 mm of aluminum and 4 mm of lead. To study electron scattering contribution, the lateral dose distribution was compared simulating a shielding disc of 10 mm thickness of lead and 30 mm diameter, misaligned with respect to the collimator. Results: The fast MC algorithm PDD and LD distributions in water agree with Geant4 simulation (fig. 1.a). The two methods however exhibit different BSF predictions, with the fast MC predicting larger values than the GEANT4 simulation (fig. 1.b). A maximum difference of 10% is seen for the lead shielding disc. Conclusions: In the water phantom both fast MC and GEANT4 simulations agree. Further evaluations, probably comparing to actual experiments with shielding disk are needed, along with a comparison of simulated doses in clinical patient CT DICOM volumes. (Figure Presented).",,0

Standard procedure after BCT is whole breast irradiation (which reduces local risk of recurrence in about 16-30%) with higher dose to tumour bed (it decreases the risk of recurrence by 6%) for 5-7 weeks. The dose escalation may be proceeded by interstitial and intracavital brachytherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy and conformal RT (3D-CRT) from external beams. In this study IORT was the only method used to boost the tumour bed. The aim of the study was to evaluate effectiveness of treatment, analyse early and late radiation reactions, cosmetic effect and quality of patients life. Materials and Methods: There were analysed 100 patients after BCT, IORT (10 Gy/1 fraction; electron beam) and EBRT (50Gy/25 fractions; two tangential photon beams) with minimal observation period of 1 year.

Cesco,2000.0,Lymphoscintigraphy and gamma probe tracing in detecting breast cancer lymph node involvement: can they replace axillary lymph node dissection?,", ","BACKGROUND: Axillary lymph node status is the most important pathological determinant of prognosis in early breast cancer. However, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) performed for pathological assessment is not without costs and morbidity. Recently, radioisotope-guided sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has been proposed as a promising technique for staging breast cancer patients. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study we report our experience (76 patients) in radioguided sentinel node (SN) biopsy in breast cancer. The study was divided into two phases: the first represents our learning curve, necessary to establish our guidelines for its use in clinical practice, while the second phase was aimed at assessing the feasibility of SN localization using preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma probe (GP) detection. METHODS: All patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy (LS) up to two hours after tracer delivery (99mTc-micro-nanocolloid, four i.d. injections of 200 microCi/200 miccroL around the primary lesion) 24 hours before surgery and GP tracing during surgery. Subsequently ALND was performed for pathological assessment. RESULTS: SNs were identified in 73/76 patients using LS and in 72/76 using GP. In one case the SN was detected by GP alone while in two cases GP was not able to locate the SN although it had been identified by means of LS. Thirty-three of these 73 patients had axillary node involvement. In 31/33 cases the SN was the only positive node. No positive nodes were found in the remaining 40 ALNDs where SNs were identified. Thus, according to our experience 40/73 ALNDs could have been avoided. SNB seems to be a very interesting technique but further experience in lymph node radioisotope tracing is needed.",eng,0

This study examined the impact of evidence, process and context factors on NICE decision regarding an innovative intraoperative radiotherapy (Intrabeam) for early breast cancer. Methods: We explored the chronology of events from the time of submission of evidence by the manufacturer followed by the NICE assessment group appraisal and updates provided by the NICE Technology Appraisal Committee on Intrabeam. Results: NICE invited evidence submission by the manufacturer by 06 Jan 2014. Manufacturer claimed that Intrabeam is a cost saving technology which improves the quality of life. NICE assessment group cited concerns based on 'investment on equipment and staff training, longer term follow-up data and analysis of registry data' in their report published on 08 May 2014. NICE Technology Appraisal Committee met on 24 June 2014 and issued conditional recommendations for the use of Intrabeam Radiotherapy System as an option for adjuvant treatment of early invasive breast cancer. In committee meetings on 27 August 2014 and 26 August 2015 further information on the clinical effectiveness data was requested. In their last update on 06 November 2015 the committee decided that further work by NICE would be required before it could issue a recommendation to the NHS. Conclusions: Intrabeam is available for routine use in many countries. Intrabeam, replaces a course of at least 15 (up to 30) postoperative radiotherapy sessions. This could greatly reduce the health care resource burden and enhance the quality of life. Until NICE publishes its final guidance, decisions on whether or not to fund specific treatments are the responsibility of local National Health Service bodies. Incorporation of patients' perspective with economic/social/ethical dimensions is essential in the evidence synthesis for multi-criteria decision process.",,0

An individualised risk-adapted approach to adjuvant radiotherapy has been tested in the randomised TARGIT-A trial which tested the efficacy of one dose of radiation to tumour bed during lumpectomy. The objective of the present study was to assess the cost effectiveness of TARGIT-A in these patients. Methods: A model based economic evaluation compared single dose TARGIT-A with current practice of EBRT in UK. A state transition Markov model approach was used to simulate the treatment outcomes in a time horizon of 20 years post-surgery. The primary outcome of interest was quality adjusted life years gained (QALY) and analysis was conducted from the health care payer's perspective. To address decision uncertainty, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. A discount rate of 3.5% was applied to future costs and effects. Results: In the Base Case Analysis TARGIT-A was a dominant strategy yielding higher QALYs at a lower cost than EBRT. Discounted EBRT and IORT costs for the time horizon of 20 years were 20,926 and 14,461 respectively. Discounted incremental QALY gained by use of IORT was 0.0069. Model results were robust to parameter uncertainty and probabilistic results were similar to the deterministic results. Application of the net monetary benefit (NMB) framework revealed higher NMB for TARGIT-A in all Monte Carlo simulations. Cost effectiveness acceptability curves show that TARGIT-A is cost effective at various willingness to pay thresholds. Conclusions: TARGIT-A is a cost effective strategy to treat early breast cancer patients in the UK. Implementation of this one-off radiation treatment within a risk-adapted approach could improve quality of life by sparing them from the protracted course of EBRT, improve compliance, prevent unnecessary mastectomies and save valuable NHS resources.",,0

In contrast, local recurrence after a lumpectomy occurs mainly at the site of the original tumour. Therefore, we hypothesized that cancer foci in other quadrants remain dormant even in the absence of radiation treatment to the whole breast [1]. This academic insight led us to develop the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) technique using the Intrabeam device. In the TARGIT A randomized trial (n=3451) we compared risk adapted TARGIT vs. whole breast radiotherapy [2]. Materials and Methods: Randomisation occurred either before surgery (Prepathology stratum: TARGIT given during lumpectomy) or after surgery (TARGIT given as a delayed procedure); the main analysis found that using TARGIT during initial lumpectomy is the preferred option rather than delayed administration by reopening the wound. We therefore estimated the number of cancer foci in quadrants other than the original tumour and compared the incidence of recurrence in such quadrants as per treatment received (TARGIT vs. EBRT). Results: 793 patients in the prepathology stratum randomized to TARGIT had only TARGIT as their radiotherapy and had. 2098 women years of follow up. The 5 year local recurrence rate in those who received TARGIT alone was 2.7% (95% CI 1.35.5), which was not different from the whole prepathology cohort randomized to TARGIT: 2.1% (1.14.2). In these 793 patients, one would expect 63% (i.e., 500) of patients to have additional foci of cancer in their breasts and 80% of these (i.e., 400) should be in quadrants other than the index quadrant. In reality, after 2098 women years of follow up, 7 patients had recurrence in the scar, 6 had new contralateral cancers and 2 had cancers growing in other quadrants implying that the remaining 398 foci had remained dormant. Amongst 935 patients who received whole breast radiotherapy the same number of cancers (n=2) grew in other quadrants and there were 5 new contralateral cancers. Of note, 94.4% of cases in the TARGIT A trial did not have a preoperative MRI, so patients who may have had multicentric foci detectable by MRI would have not been excluded from the trial. Conclusions: Cancer foci in breast that are away from the site of the primary tumour remain dormant and behave no differently from those in the contralateral breast. They also appear to be unaffected by whole breast radiotherapy or are treated sufficiently by systemic therapies. This analysis from the randomized TARGIT A trial provides further proof supporting partial breast irradiation.",,0

Vaidya,2010.0,Pragmatism in the TARGIT trial encouraged wider participation of centres yet yielded an unexpected homogeneous patient profile,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&AN=70122300","In 1999, we designed a randomised controlled trial to test whether TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy (TARGIT) was equivalent to postoperative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). To cater for a wide level of equipoise, our design was pragmatic with minimal restrictions for age (>45) and tumour size (preferably smaller than 3.5 cm), and no restrictions for grade and nodal status. At the outset, each centre specified these options in a treatment policy document. This analysis of the treatment policies includes 1674 patients from 24 centres ransomised until April 2009. The minimum age at entry was specified to be 40, 45/48, and 50 by 2, 8 and 14 centres that randomised 243 (14.5%), 514 (30%) and 917 (55%) patients. However, 1566 (93.5%) of patients randomised were >50; 45-49y = 83 (5%) and 40-44y = 21 (1.25%). 10 (525 patients) centres did not restrict tumour size while 8 (800 patients), 1 (187 patients), 5 (152 patients) centres restricted the size to <2cm, <2.5 cm, <3 cm. However, 84% patients had tumour size <2 cm and <4% were >3.5cm. Grade 3 was excluded by only 4 centres (278 (16.6%) patients), but only 13% of all randomised patients had grade 3 cancers. TARGIT could also be delivered either as a first or second procedure, and 37% more patients were randomised because of this. Furthermore, if patients randomised and given intraoperative radioatherapy were found to be high risk of elsewhere-recurrence (e.g. lobular cancers or EIC or other prespecified features) EBRT could be added within the protocol which essentially tested the two strategies and not techniques. Only 10% patients randomised to IORT received additional EBRT. Allowing clinicians to be liberal in their intended inclusion criteria increased appeal and encouraged wider participation, yet led to a relatively homogeneous patient sample, demonstrating an unexpected conservatism in this pragmatic trial.",,0

We present here the clinico-pathological basis for this view, as well as a novel therapeutic approach that allows intra-operative radiotherapy to be safely and accurately delivered to the target tissues in a standard operating theatre. The rationale: Whole-organ analysis of mastectomy specimens reveals that 80% of occult cancer foci are situated remote from the index quadrant. In contrast, over 90% of local recurrences after breast conservative therapy occur near the original tumour, even when radiotherapy is not given. Therefore, the remote occult cancer foci may be clinically irrelevant and radiotherapy to the index quadrant alone might be sufficient. A novel technique: The Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS) is an ingenious portable electron-beam driven device that can typically deliver intra-operative doses of 5-20 Gy, respectively, to 1 cm and 0.2 cm from the tumour bed over about 22 min. The pliable breast tissue - the target - wraps around the source, providing perfect conformal radiotherapy. Being soft X-rays, the dose attenuates rapidly (alpha ~ 1/r<sup>3</sup>), reducing distant damage. Results: In our pilot study of 25 patients (age 30-80 years, T = 0.42-4.0 cm), we replaced the routine post-operative tumour bed boost with targeted intra-operative radiotherapy. There have been no major complications and no patient has developed local recurrence, although the median follow-up time is short, at 24 months. Conclusion: It is safe and feasible to deliver targeted intra-operative radiotherapy (Targit) for early breast cancer. We have begun a randomised trial - the first of its kind - comparing Targit with conventional six-week course of radiotherapy. If proven equivalent in terms of local recurrence and cosmesis, it could eliminate the need for the usual six-week course of post-operative radiotherapy.",,0

Methods and Materials: We treated 302 cancers in 301 unselected patients. This was not a low-risk group. One-third of patients (98/301) were younger than 51 years of age. More than half of the tumors (172, 57%) were between 1 cm and 2 cm, and one-fifth (62, 21%) were >2 cm; 29% (86) had a Grade 3 tumor and, in 29% (87), axillary lymph nodes contained metastasis. After primary surgery, 20 Gy was delivered intraoperatively to the surface of the tumor bed, followed by external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT), but excluding the usual boost. Results: The treatment was well tolerated. The follow-up ranged from 3 to 80 months (164 and 90 patients completed 2 and 3 years follow-up, respectively). Four patients (1.3%) had local recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of local recurrence is 2.6% (SE = 1.7) at 5 years. This compares favorably with the 4.3% recurrence rate in boosted patients from the EORTC boost study, in which only 8.1% patients were node-positive, as opposed to 29% in our series. Conclusion: Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy combined with EBRT results in a low local recurrence rate. This could be attributed to both accurate targeting and timeliness of the treatment. These data support the need for a randomized trial to test whether the TARGIT boost is superior to conventional external boost, especially in high-risk women. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We have developed a novel therapeutic approach that allows targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (Targit) to be safely and accurately delivered in a standard operating theatre. We are currently recruiting for a randomized trial testing whether Targit can replace the whole 6 weeks of post-operative radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery. Methods: This paper describes the operative technique. It employs a miniature electron-beam-driven X-ray source called INTRABEAMTM (PeC) that emits soft X-rays (50 kV) from within the breast. The X-rays are emitted from the tip of a 10 cm x 3.2 mm diameter probe, that is enclosed in a spherical applicator (available in 2.5-5 cm diameter sizes), which in turn is inserted in the tumour bed and intraoperative radiotherapy is delivered in about 25 min. The prescribed dose is 5 and 20 Gy at 1 cm and 0.2 cm respectively, from the tumour bed. Results: The biologically effective dose is 7-53 Gy for alpha/beta = 10 and 20-120 Gy for alpha/beta = 1.5. The quick attenuation of the radiation reduces the damage to normal tissues and allows radiotherapy to be delivered in a standard operating theatre. Tungsten impregnated rubber sheets, cut to size, are placed on the chest wall to protect the heart/lungs and over the wound to stop stray radiation. The skin dose is monitored with thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs). After wide local excision of the tumour and good haemostasis, a spherical applicator is inserted in the tumour bed and the target breast tissues are wrapped around it with a purse-string suture. Thus, true conformation of the target around the applicator source is achieved in real time. Conclusion: As a tumour bed boost, this technique has the potential to reduce local recurrence by avoiding geographical misses and achieving excellent dosimetry. In patients with low risk of local recurrence, it has the potential to replace the full 6 weeks of post-operative radiotherapy with considerable implications to patients and hospitals. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this study, we report on the feasibility, safety, and long-term efficacy of TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy (Targit), using the Intrabeam system. Methods and Materials: A total of 300 cancers in 299 unselected patients underwent breast-conserving surgery and Targit as a boost to the tumor bed. After lumpectomy, a single dose of 20 Gy was delivered intraoperatively. Postoperative external beam whole-breast radiotherapy excluded the usual boost. We also performed a novel individualized case control (ICC) analysis that computed the expected recurrences for the cohort by estimating the risk of recurrence for each patient using their characteristics and follow-up period. Results: The treatment was well tolerated. The median follow up was 60.5 months (range, 10-122 months). Eight patients have had ipsilateral recurrence: 5-year Kaplan Meier estimate for ipsilateral recurrence is 1.73% (SE 0.77), which compares well with that seen in the boosted patients in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer study (4.3%) and the UK STAndardisation of breast RadioTherapy study (2.8%). In a novel ICC analysis of 242 of the patients, we estimated that there should be 11.4 recurrences; in this group, only 6 recurrences were observed. Conclusions: Lumpectomy and Targit boost combined with external beam radiotherapy results in a low local recurrence rate in a standard risk patient population. Accurate localization and the immediacy of the treatment that has a favorable effect on tumour microenvironment may contribute to this effect. These long-term data establish the long-term safety and efficacy of the Targit technique and generate the hypothesis that Targit boost might be superior to an external beam boost in its efficacy and justifies a randomized trial. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,0

These results showed that the risk of local recurrence in the TARGIT group was non-inferior to that of the EBRT group (the difference between the two arms was 0.25% at 4 years). We now report the results analyzed after further follow up of the total trial cohort without unblinding. Method: As often repeated, unplanned analysis comparing two groups in a randomized trial can result in an increased alpha-spent as well as carry the risk of a false positive result, we have remained blinded to the further recurrences in the trial according to allocated treatment, since the original publication in the Lancet. Instead we proposed and performed a blinded analysis of the local recurrence rate for the whole cohort. We plotted the Kaplan Meier plots and compared the estimated 4-year recurrences. Results: Amongst the 2232 patients randomized, there were 13 recurrences at the time of Lancet publication and since then, we have had 8 additional recurrences. The number of patients who have completed at least 4 years of follow up has increased from 420 to 717. We found that the 4-year Kaplan Meier estimate of local recurrence was 1.08% (95% CI 0.59 -1.96) at the time of the Lancet publication and it is 1.09% (95% CI 0.65 - 1.85) now. Conclusion: We found that the overall 4-year recurrence rates of the TARGIT-A trial have remained stable with a longer follow up and therefore; it is statistically implausible, that one particular arm has a significantly higher local recurrence.""",,0

Partial-breast radiation therapy, which focuses radiation to the tumor bed, may achieve this aim. We analyzed mortality differences in randomized trials of partial-breast irradiation (PBI). Methods and Materials: We included data from published randomized trials of PBI (alone or as part of a risk-adapted approach) versus whole-breast irradiation (WBI) for invasive breast cancer suitable for breast-conserving therapy. We identified trials using PubMed and Google searches with the terms partial breast irradiation"" OR ""intraoperative radiotherapy"" OR ""IMRT"" OR (""accelerated"" AND ""radiation"") AND ""randomised/randomized,"" as well as through discussion with colleagues in the field. We calculated the proportion of patients who had events in each randomized arm at 5 years' follow-up and created a forest plot using Stata, version 14.1. Results: We identified 9 randomized trials of PBI versus WBI in invasive breast cancer; 5-year outcomes were available for non-breast cancer mortality in 5 trials (n=4489) and for breast cancer mortality in 4 trials (n=4231). The overall mortality was 4.9%. There was no detectable heterogeneity between the trials for any of the outcomes. There was no difference in the proportion of patients dying of breast cancer (difference, 0.000% [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.7 to +0.7]; . P=.999). Non-breast cancer mortality with PBI was lower than with WBI (difference, 1.1% [95% CI, -2.1% to -0.2%]; . P=.023). Total mortality with PBI was also lower than with WBI (difference, 1.3% [95% CI, -2.5% to 0.0%]; . P=.05). Conclusions: Use of PBI instead of WBI in selected patients results in a lower 5-year non-breast cancer and overall mortality, amounting to a 25% reduction in relative terms. This information should be included when breast-conserving therapy is proposed to a patient. Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).""",,0

For the primary end point of ipsilateral breast recurrence, compared with EBRT, TARGIT achieved non-inferior local control in all cases and identical local control when given concurrently with lumpectomy in ER+PR+ cases. For the secondary endpoint of death, compared with EBRT, TARGIT had significantly fewer non-breast cancer deaths (1). We investigated whether this difference could be explained by toxicity from EBRT.

Thus, restriction of radiation therapy to the tumour bed during surgery might be adequate for selected patients. We compared targeted intraoperative radiotherapy with the conventional policy of whole breast external beam radiotherapy. METHODS: Having safely piloted the new technique of single-dose targeted intraoperative radiotherapy with Intrabeam, we launched the TARGIT-A trial on March 24, 2000. In this prospective, randomised, non-inferiority trial, women aged 45 years or older with invasive ductal breast carcinoma undergoing breast-conserving surgery were enrolled from 28 centres in nine countries. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive targeted intraoperative radiotherapy or whole breast external beam radiotherapy, with blocks stratified by centre and by timing of delivery of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy. Neither patients nor investigators or their teams were masked to treatment assignment. Postoperative discovery of predefined factors (eg, lobular carcinoma) could trigger addition of external beam radiotherapy to targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (in an expected 15% of patients). The primary outcome was local recurrence in the conserved breast. The predefined non-inferiority margin was an absolute difference of 2.5% in the primary endpoint. All randomised patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00983684. FINDINGS: 1113 patients were randomly allocated to targeted intraoperative radiotherapy and 1119 were allocated to external beam radiotherapy. Of 996 patients who received the allocated treatment in the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy group, 854 (86%) received targeted intraoperative radiotherapy only and 142 (14%) received targeted intraoperative radiotherapy plus external beam radiotherapy. 1025 (92%) patients in the external beam radiotherapy group received the allocated treatment. At 4 years, there were six local recurrences in the intraoperative radiotherapy group and five in the external beam radiotherapy group. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of local recurrence in the conserved breast at 4 years was 1.20% (95% CI 0.53-2.71) in the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy and 0.95% (0.39-2.31) in the external beam radiotherapy group (difference between groups 0.25%, -1.04 to 1.54; p=0.41). The frequency of any complications and major toxicity was similar in the two groups (for major toxicity, targeted intraoperative radiotherapy, 37 [3.3%] of 1113 vs external beam radiotherapy, 44 [3.9%] of 1119; p=0.44). Radiotherapy toxicity (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3) was lower in the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy group (six patients [0.5%]) than in the external beam radiotherapy group (23 patients [2.1%]; p=0.002). INTERPRETATION: For selected patients with early breast cancer, a single dose of radiotherapy delivered at the time of surgery by use of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy should be considered as an alternative to external beam radiotherapy delivered over several weeks.

Postoperative discovery of predefined factors (eg, lobular carcinoma) could trigger addition of external beam radiotherapy to targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (in an expected 15% of patients). The primary outcome was local recurrence in the conserved breast. The predefined non-inferiority margin was an absolute difference of 2.5% in the primary endpoint. All randomised patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00983684. Findings 1113 patients were randomly allocated to targeted intraoperative radiotherapy and 1119 were allocated to external beam radiotherapy. Of 996 patients who received the allocated treatment in the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy group, 854 (86%) received targeted intraoperative radiotherapy only and 142 (14%) received targeted intraoperative radiotherapy plus external beam radiotherapy. 1025 (92%) patients in the external beam radiotherapy group received the allocated treatment. At 4 years, there were six local recurrences in the intraoperative radiotherapy group and five in the external beam radiotherapy group. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of local recurrence in the conserved breast at 4 years was 1.20% (95% CI 0.53-2.71) in the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy and 0.95% (0.39-2.31) in the external beam radiotherapy group (difference between groups 0.25%, -1.04 to 1.54; p=0.41). The frequency of any complications and major toxicity was similar in the two groups (for major toxicity, targeted intraoperative radiotherapy, 37 [3.3%] of 1113 vs external beam radiotherapy, 44 [3.9%] of 1119; p=0.44). Radiotherapy toxicity (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3) was lower in the targeted intraoperative radiotherapy group (six patients [0.5%]) than in the external beam radiotherapy group (23 patients [2.1%]; p=0.002). Interpretation For selected patients with early breast cancer, a single dose of radiotherapy delivered at the time of surgery by use of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy should be considered as an alternative to external beam radiotherapy delivered over several weeks.

Baum,2010.0,Targeted intra-operative radiotherapy boost-TARGIT-B trial: A randomized trial for young and high risk patients including those after post-neoadjuvant systemic therapy lumpectomy,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed12&AN=70272291","Background: Local recurrence remains high when breast conserving surgery (BCS) is performed after good response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST). This could be attributed to the presence of surgical wound fluid that provides a conducive microenvironment for tumour growth (1). Rationale: Long term results of our phase II study using TARGIT as a boost found a lower than expected local recurrence rate (2) in an unselected group of patients. Translational research suggests that this could be attributed to the novel effect of TARGIT tumour microenvironment (1) in addition to the temporal proximity and spatial accuracy of the TARGIT technique (3). The international TARGIT-A trial (www.thelancet.com/protocol-reviews/99PRT-47) compared TARGIT vs. standard whole breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after BCS in women older than 45 with favourable prognosis breast cancer. Local recurrence was the main outcome measure. The trial accrual (n=2232) from 28 international centres is complete and the results will be presented in ASCO 2010. We are now launching the TARGIT-B trial to test its superiority to EBRT boost. Trial design: Patients at a higher risk of local recurrence (e.g., women < 45 yrs, high grade, after shrinkage with NAST) will be randomly allocated to receive their tumour bed boost with either TARGIT or EBRT. Both groups will also receive whole breast radiotherapy. Primary outcome will be local recurrence rate. Many investigators, in addition to the TARGIT-A centres, have expressed strong interest in participating. Conclusions: If TARGIT-Boost is shown to be superior to EBRT boost and TARGIT-A is found to be equivalent to EBRT then TARGIT approach would provide a way to give individualized treatment to breast cancer patients of varying risks of local recurrence.

Apart from the consumption of huge resources and patients' time, postoperative radiotherapy deters many women from receiving the benefits of breast-conserving surgery, forcing them to choose a mastectomy instead. If radiotherapy could be given in the operating theatre immediately after surgery, many of these disadvantages could be overcome. One striking fact about local recurrence after breast-conserving surgery is that most occurs in the area of breast immediately next to the primary tumour; this is despite the finding that two-thirds of mastectomy samples have microscopic tumours distributed throughout the breast, even when radiotherapy is omitted. Thus, only the area adjacent to the tumour may need treatment with radiotherapy. On the basis of this premise, clinical scientists have used new technology to administer radiotherapy to the area at greatest risk of local recurrence, with the aim of completing the whole local treatment in one sitting. In this review, we have elaborated on the rationale and different methods of delivery of intraoperative radiotherapy. If this approach is validated by the results of current randomised trials, it could save time, money, and breasts.",,0

Such prolonged postoperative radiotherapy is a burden to patients and hospitals and forces many women to chose mastectomy instead. Furthermore, for patients receiving chemotherapy, the start of conventional radiotherapy may be delayed so long as to increase the risk of local relapse. These problems might be eliminated if effective radiotherapy could be given as a single treatment intraoperatively, immediately after the surgery. Local recurrence after breast-conserving surgery usually occurs in the portion of the breast in the immediate proximity of the tumor, even when radiotherapy is omitted. Therefore, it should usually be possible to restrict radiotherapy to only the area adjacent to the tumor in selected women. Based on this premise, we have devised a new technique of partial breast irradiation, with the intention of completing all local treatment in a single session. In this article, we elaborate on the rationale and on the different methods of delivering intraoperative radiotherapy.

In the Targit (TARGeted Intraoperative radio Therapy) trial IORT can be delivered at the time of primary surgery or as a second procedure. Patients prefer the single procedure of intraoperative radiotherapy even if it is under general anaesthetic to 6-weeks of daily visits for conventional external beam radiotherapy. Case presentation: We report a case of a 70 year lady who underwent lumpectomy and axillary sampling and in whom we successfully administered IORT under local anaesthetic.

Risk-adaptive approach meant that if the final pathology report demonstrated unpredicted pre-specified adverse features, then EBRT was to be added to TARGIT. Method 3451 women aged 45 years or older with invasive ductal carcinoma were enrolled from 33 centres in 10 countries between 2000 and 2012. Randomisation to TARGIT or EBRT arm was done either before lumpectomy (pre-pathology) or after lumpectomy (postpathology). If allocated to TARGIT, patients in the pre-pathology group received it immediately after surgical excision under the same anaesthesia; patients in the post-pathology group received it as a subsequent procedure. We pre-specified that analysis would be performed overall as the primary analysis and for these groups separately as a secondary analysis. The primary outcome was ipsilateral within breast recurrence (IBR) with an absolute non-inferiority margin of 2.5% at 5 years and secondary outcome was survival. We performed exploratory analyses for loco-regional recurrence, 'all recurrence' (ipsilateral or contralateral breast, axilla or distant), distant recurrence, and causes of death. Results 1721 patients were randomly allocated to receive TARGIT and 1730 to EBRT. 1010 patients have a minimum 4 years follow up and 611 patients have minimum 5 years follow up. Primary events have increased from 13 to 34 since 2010. For the primary outcome of ipsilateral breast recurrence, the absolute difference at 5-years was 2.0%, which was higher with TARGIT and reached the conventional levels of statistical significance (p = 0.042), but was within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin; in prepathology the absolute difference in 5-year IBR was 1%; in postpathology it was 3.7%. For the secondary outcome, there was a non-significant trend for improved overall survival with TARGIT (HR = 0.70(0.46-1.07)) due to fewer non-breast cancer deaths (17 vs. 35, HR 0.47 (0.26-0.84)). Cardiovascular deaths were 1 vs. 10 and deaths from cancers other than breast were 7 vs.16. (Table Presented) Conclusion The risk-adapted approach using single dose TARGIT has a slightly higher local recurrence rate than EBRT for the primary endpoint of IBR, but was within the preset non-inferiority boundary, with the prepathology apparently performing better than the postpathology stratum. In addition there was a trend for improved overall survival in the TARGIT arm due to fewer non-breast cancer deaths.",,0

We report 5-year results for local recurrence and the first analysis of overall survival. METHODS: TARGIT-A was a randomised, non-inferiority trial. Women aged 45 years and older with invasive ductal carcinoma were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive TARGIT or whole-breast EBRT, with blocks stratified by centre and by timing of delivery of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy: randomisation occurred either before lumpectomy (prepathology stratum, TARGIT concurrent with lumpectomy) or after lumpectomy (postpathology stratum, TARGIT given subsequently by reopening the wound). Patients in the TARGIT group received supplemental EBRT (excluding a boost) if unforeseen adverse features were detected on final pathology, thus radiotherapy was risk-adapted. The primary outcome was absolute difference in local recurrence in the conserved breast, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 2.5% at 5 years; prespecified analyses included outcomes as per timing of randomisation in relation to lumpectomy. Secondary outcomes included complications and mortality. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00983684. FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled at 33 centres in 11 countries, between March 24, 2000, and June 25, 2012. 1721 patients were randomised to TARGIT and 1730 to EBRT. Supplemental EBRT after TARGIT was necessary in 15.2% [239 of 1571] of patients who received TARGIT (21.6% prepathology, 3.6% postpathology). 3451 patients had a median follow-up of 2 years and 5 months (IQR 12-52 months), 2020 of 4 years, and 1222 of 5 years. The 5-year risk for local recurrence in the conserved breast was 3.3% (95% CI 2.1-5.1) for TARGIT versus 1.3% (0.7-2.5) for EBRT (p=0.042). TARGIT concurrently with lumpectomy (prepathology, n=2298) had much the same results as EBRT: 2.1% (1.1-4.2) versus 1.1% (0.5-2.5; p=0.31). With delayed TARGIT (postpathology, n=1153) the between-group difference was larger than 2.5% (TARGIT 5.4% [3.0-9.7] vs EBRT 1.7% [0.6-4.9]; p=0.069). Overall, breast cancer mortality was much the same between groups (2.6% [1.5-4.3] for TARGIT vs 1.9% [1.1-3.2] for EBRT; p=0.56) but there were significantly fewer non-breast-cancer deaths with TARGIT (1.4% [0.8-2.5] vs 3.5% [2.3-5.2]; p=0.0086), attributable to fewer deaths from cardiovascular causes and other cancers. Overall mortality was 3.9% (2.7-5.8) for TARGIT versus 5.3% (3.9-7.3) for EBRT (p=0.099). Wound-related complications were much the same between groups but grade 3 or 4 skin complications were significantly reduced with TARGIT (four of 1720 vs 13 of 1731, p=0.029).

At the San Antonio update, it was suggested that the preferred option is to give TARGIT concurrently with lumpectomy (prepathology). In this analysis we describe patient and tumour factors that may help select patients for TARGIT based on the results of an a priori statistical analysis plan. Methods: In this large international trial, 3451 patients (age>=45, unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma, size <3.5 cm) from 33 centres in 10 countries were randomly allocated to either TARGIT or EBRT. Primary outcome was ipsilateral breast recurrence and secondary included mortality. Before unblinding for this analysis, we hypothesised that progesterone receptor (PgR) status, as an expression of a functionally active oestrogen receptor (ER), is a surrogate for radiation responsiveness and could predict a difference between the outcome for local control in the two randomised groups and pre-specified a detailed analysis by PgR status. We also assessed whether a Cox proportional hazard model including age, margin status, tumour grade, ER, PgR, HER2, vascular invasion and node positivity was consistent with our results. Results: For PgR positive cases, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of Ipsilateral breast recurrence between TARGIT and EBRT (2.3%(1.3-4.3) vs. 1.5%(0.75-3.0) p = 0.51, while in PgR negative cases there were significantly more local recurrences after partial breast irradiation using TARGIT: 7.0%(3.5-13.6) vs. 0.5%(0.1-3.7) p = 0.017. By contrast, age, margin status, tumour grade, tumour size, vascular invasion, node positivity, ER and Her2 status were not found to be significant predictors. Even age younger than 50 or grade 3 cancers had similar outcome with TARGIT or EBRT. Exploratory analyses in conjunction with the timing of TARGIT, revealed that when TARGIT was given concurrently in PgR positive cases (n = 1625) the results were (TARGIT vs. EBRT): ipsilateral breast recurrence 4 vs. 5, 5-year risk 1.4%(0.46-3.9) vs. 1.2%(0.48-2.9) HR 0.82(0.22-3.06), and overall mortality 18 vs. 31, 5-year risk 3.3%(1.83-6.04) vs. 6.4%(4.3-9.6) HR 0.60(0.34-1.08). Conclusions: It appears that progesterone receptor status is useful in selecting cases for using the TARGIT concurrently with lumpectomy for breast cancer. Progesterone receptor negative patients may fall in the cautious or unsuitable category and progesterone receptor positive cases are in the suitable category for partial breast irradiation with TARGIT.",,0

Trombetta,2012.0,A comprehensive analysis of cardiac dose in balloon-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy for left-sided breast cancer,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.02.058,"PURPOSE: To investigate radiation dose to the heart in 60 patients with left-sided breast cancer who were treated with balloon-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy using MammoSite or Contura applicators. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We studied 60 consecutive women with breast cancer who were treated with 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions using MammoSite (n = 37) or Contura (n = 23) applicators. The whole heart and the left and right ventricles were retrospectively delineated, and dose-volume histograms were analyzed. Multiple dosimetrics were reported, such as mean dose (D(mean)); relative volume receiving 1.7, 5, 10, and 20 Gy (V1.7, V5, V10, and V20, respectively); dose to 1 cc (D(1cc)); and maximum point dose (D(max)). Biologic metrics, biologically effective dose and generalized equivalent uniform dose were computed. The impact of lumpectomy cavity location on cardiac dose was investigated. RESULTS: The average +/- standard deviation of D(mean) was 2.45 +/- 0.94 Gy (range, 0.56-4.68) and 3.29 +/- 1.28 Gy (range, 0.77-6.35) for the heart and the ventricles, respectively. The average whole heart V5 and V10 values were 10.2% and 1.3%, respectively, and the heart D(max) was >20 Gy in 7 of 60 (11.7%) patients and >25 Gy in 3 of 60 (5%) patients. No cardiac tissue received >/=30 Gy. The V1.7, V5, V10, V20, and D(mean) values were all higher for the ventricles than for the whole heart. For balloons located in the upper inner quadrant of the breast, the average whole heart D(mean) was highest. The D(mean), biologically effective dose, and generalized equivalent uniform dose values for heart and ventricles decreased with increasing minimal distance from the surface of the balloon. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these comprehensive cardiac dosimetric data, we recommend that cardiac dose be routinely reported and kept as low as possible in balloon-based high-dose-rate brachytherapy treatment planning for patients with left-sided breast cancer so the correlation with future cardiac toxicity data can be investigated.",eng,0
Journal Article,M. Valbonesi; R. Bruni; G. Lercari; G. Florio; P. Carlier; F. Morelli,1999.0,Autoapheresis and intraoperative blood salvage in oncologic surgery,", ","Transfusion of predeposit or salvaged autologous blood has continued to grow since the 1980s. Issues such as the indications for use and cost effectiveness as well as the safety of autologous blood salvaged during cancer surgery have emerged and should be addressed. The concern for possible contamination of autologous RBC with cancer cells responsible for metastasis has limited the use of autologous salvaged blood in cancer patients. Nevertheless, clinical experience has been gained on the use of salvaged blood in patients with colorectal, gastric, renal, hepatic, breast, bladder and lung cancer. No evidence has been reported showing an increase in metastasis or a decrease in patient survival, in spite of the obvious demonstration that salvaged blood is contaminated with viable tumor cells which are not washed out of the RBC layer during intraoperative blood salvage (IOBS). However, a number of limitations have hampered the widespread use of IOBS in these patients and the technique is not well established. Increasing knowledge of the deleterious effects of allogeneic blood transfusion both in terms of the increased number of viral or bacterial infections and the down-regulation of the patient's immune system have recalled attention to IOBS and to the techniques such as filtration, which might reduce the risk of reinfusion of cancer cells, or totally eliminate the risks such as irradiation has been proposed by Hansen's group. This paper reviews the topic with some emphasis on our personal experience with gamma and X-ray irradiation of salvaged blood in a large reference hospital, where IOBS and filtration of salvaged blood were established for use in cancer patients in 1993 and 1996.",eng,0

The combination of breast-conservation surgery and radiotherapy has become a standard of treatment for most breast cancers. It is critical to obtain clear margins to minimize local recurrence. The literature suggests that intraoperative touch preparation cytology (IOTPC) can be useful in evaluation of margins. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10% to 15% of all breast cancers. Obtaining clear margins in ILC can be more challenging. Literature shows the positive margin rate for ILC to be as high as 60%. This report describes our experience with IOTPC for margin assessment in ILC by a single surgeon at Beth Israel Medical Center. The purpose of this study is to determine whether IOTPC is reliable for ILC. METHODS: A prospective review of 73 patients who underwent breast-conservation surgery with the use of IOTPC for margin assessment at Beth Israel Medical Center was performed. Pathology revealed ILC in 12 of these patients (16.4%), who are the subjects of this study. The lumpectomy specimens were oriented by the surgeon intraoperatively and were submitted fresh to pathology for cytologic assessment. IOTPC consisted of touching the corresponding margin onto the glass slide. The principle of this technique is that if cancer cells are present, they will stick to the slide, whereas fat cells will not. Six slides were prepared for each lumpectomy specimen. Air-dried samples were stained immediately by the Diff-Quik method and examined under the microscope by a cytopathologist. RESULTS: Twelve patients with ILC underwent breast-conservation surgery with IOTPC for assessment of 72 margins. Ten patients had lobular carcinoma only, and the remaining two patients had a combination of lobular and ductal carcinoma. There was a correlation between IOTPC and final pathology in 60 of 72 margins, which accounted for 83.3% of the cases. IOTPC for assessment of margins in patients undergoing breast-conservation surgery for ILC has a sensitivity of 8.3%, specificity of 98.3%, positive predictive value of 50%, and negative predictive value of 84.3%. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our experience, IOTPC is of limited value for intraoperative assessment of margins for ILC.",eng,0

Feldman,2007.0,Intra-operative touch preparation cytology; does it have a role in re-excision lumpectomy?,10.1245/s10434-006-9263-x,"OBJECTIVE: Breast carcinoma is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women of North America. The combination of breast conservation surgery and radiotherapy has become a standard of treatment for the majority of breast cancers. It is critical to obtain clear margins to minimize local recurrence. However, avoiding multiple re-excisions for margin clearance helps optimize cosmetic results in patients undergoing breast conservation surgery. Intra-operative touch preparation cytology (IOTPC) may decrease the need for multiple re-excisions and thereby improve cosmesis. The literature suggests that IOTPC can be useful in evaluation of margins. Klimberg et al. evaluated the touch preparation technique prospectively in 428 patients undergoing breast biopsy for undiagnosed breast masses. Margin evaluation was correct in 100% of the lesions and was used to re-excise the margins when touch prep results were positive. They reported a diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100% for the touch prep technique. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no published data on the role of IOTPC for evaluation of margins in re-excision cases. This report describes our experience with IOTPC for margin assessment for re-excision partial mastectomy at Beth Israel Medical Center (BIMC). The purpose of this study is to determine whether IOTPC is reliable for evaluating margins in patients undergoing re-excision for involved or close margins. METHODS: A prospective study of 30 patients, who have undergone re-excision partial mastectomy for involved or close margins after breast conservation surgery with the use of IOTPC for margin assessment at BIMC was performed. The re-excision lumpectomy specimens were oriented by the surgeon intra-operatively and were submitted fresh to pathology for cytologic assessment. The touch prep method consisted of touching the corresponding margin onto the glass slide. The principle of this technique is that if cancer cells are present they will stick to the slide, while fat cells will not. A slide was prepared for each re-excision specimen. Air-dried samples were stained immediately using the Diff-Quik method and examined under the microscope by a cytopathologist. RESULTS: Thirty patients underwent re-excision lumpectomy for involved or close margins with touch preparation cytology for assessment of 68 margins. Twenty-six patients had invasive ductal carcinoma and/or ductal carcinoma in situ, three patients had invasive lobular carcinoma and the remaining one patient had a combination of invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma. There was a correlation between touch prep cytology and final pathology in 56/68 margins, which accounts for 82.4% of the cases. CONCLUSION: Intra-operative touch preparation cytology for assessment of margins in patients undergoing re-excision lumpectomy for involved or close margins has a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 82.8%, positive predictive value of 21.4%, and negative predictive value of 98.2%. This high negative predictive value and a single false negative margin are quite significant. Therefore, based on our experience, IOTPC can be a useful tool for intra-operative assessment of margins for patients undergoing re-excision partial mastectomy.",eng,0

Kroon,1999.0,Lymphoscintigraphy in oncology: a rediscovered challenge,", ","The validation of the sentinel node concept in oncology has led to the rediscovery of lymphoscintigraphy. By combining preoperative lymphatic mapping with intraoperative probe detection this nuclear medicine procedure is being increasingly used to identify and detect the sentinel node in melanoma, breast cancer, and in other malignancies such as penile cancer and vulvar cancer. In the past lymphoscintigraphy has been widely applied for various indications in oncology, and in the case of the internal mammary lymph-node chain its current use in breast cancer remains essential to adjust irradiation treatment to the individual findings of each patient. In another diagnostic area, lymphoscintigraphy is also useful to document altered drainage patterns after surgery and/or radiotherapy; its use in breast cancer patients with upper limb oedema after axillary lymph-node dissection or in melanoma patients with lower-extremity oedema after groin dissection can provide information for physiotherapy or reconstructive surgery. Finally, the renewed interest in lymphoscintigraphy in oncology has led not only to the rediscovery of findings from old literature reports, but also to a discussion about methodological aspects such as tracer characteristics, image acquisition or administration routes, as well as to discussion on the study of migration patterns of radiolabelled colloid particles in the context of cancer dissemination. All this makes the need for standardized guidelines for lymphoscintigraphy mandatory.",eng,0

Because breast cancer local recurrence rates are low and follow-up has been short-term, the exact cause of recurrences after APBI has been difficult to evaluate. We report the first case of documented radiation balloon catheter malpositioning that resulted in local recurrence. Patients undergo CT imaging of the breast after radiation balloon catheter placement for radiotherapy treatment planning, which evaluates adequate conformance of the balloon to the surrounding breast parenchyma and confirms a >7 mm distance between the balloon surface and the skin surface. Although true local recurrences are rare in appropriately selected partial breast irradiation candidates, inadvertent malpositioning of the radiation treatment catheter can increase the risk. This case is presented to illustrate the importance of comparing CT radiation planning images, with treatment catheter in place, to the original diagnostic breast imaging studies to confirm proper catheter positioning (in addition to measuring balloon to skin distance and conformance) prior to initiating radiotherapy.",eng,0

The objective of this study was to define the frequency of IORT use, patient selection, and outcomes of patients treated in North America. Methods: A multi-institutional retrospective registry was created, and 19 institutions using low-kilovoltage IORT for the treatment of breast cancer entered data on patients treated at their institution before July 31, 2013. Patient selection, IORT treatment details, complications, and recurrences were analyzed. Results: From 2007 to July 31, 2013, a total of 935 women were identified and treated with lumpectomy and IORT. A total of 822 patients had at least 6 months' follow-up documented and were included in the analysis. The number of IORT cases performed increased significantly over time (p < 0.001). The median patient age was 66.8 years. Most patients had disease that was <2 cm in size (90 %) and was estrogen positive (91 %); most patients had invasive ductal cancer (68 %). Of those who had a sentinel lymph node procedure performed, 89 % had negative sentinel lymph nodes. The types of IORT performed were primary IORT in 79 %, secondary IORT in 7 %, or planned boost in 14 %. Complications were low. At a median follow-up of 23.3 months, crude in-breast recurrence was 2.3 % for all patients treated.

Little is currently known about the use of IORT in North America. The objective of this study is to define the frequency of IORT use, patient selection and outcomes of patients treated in North America. METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective data collection registry was created using an electronic data capture system. Selected institutions using low-kilovoltage IORT for the treatment of breast cancer were invited to participate and enter data on patients treated at their institution prior to July 2013. Descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: 19 institutions participated in this data registry, which included both academic and community practices. From 2007 to 2013, 1086 women were treated with lumpectomy and IORT. 1050 patients had at least 6 months follow-up and were included in the analysis. The number of cases performed increased significantly over time (2007-10 n=129; 2011-13 n=921 p< 0.001). The median age was 67 yrs. Most women had estrogen receptor positive (91%), invasive ductal carcinoma (69%), tumor less than 2 cm in size (86%), and were lymph node negative (89%). The types of IORT performed were primary IORT (performed at initial lumpectomy) (80%), as a secondary procedure (7%) or a planned boost (13%). 18.9% of patients who had primary IORT went on to also receive external beam radiation. Complications included seroma requiring aspiration (8%), hematoma (1%) and infection requiring IV antibiotics (2.6%). Median follow-up time was 12 months (range 6 mo-5.3 yrs). Crude local in-breast recurrence was reported at 1.6% and regional nodal recurrence at 0.2%. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to broadly evaluate IORT use for treatment of breast cancer in North America. IORT use is increasing and patient selection is in accordance with the consensus guidelines for partial breast irradiation. Short-term safety and results are favorable. Continued follow-up of this unique data-set over time will provide confirmation of the efficacy and safety of this novel breast cancer treatment approach.",,0

Materials and methods: Between January 2007 and June 2008, 80 women with a diagnosis of early breast cancer (pT1: 69, pT2: 11, pN0: 66, pN1: 14) were treated with lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, with (N=14) or without (N=66) axillary lymphadenectomy. During surgery an electron boost of 9 Gy (4-12 Mev) was administered to the tumor bed using a Mobetron (Intraop, USA). Adjuvant treatment was completed with whole breast external beam radiotherapy (WBEBR, 45 Gy in 25 fractions) and systemic therapy if necessary (group 1). The outcomes in these patients was compared propectively to 100 stage-matched patients treated in the same period having similar breast conserving surgery, systemic treatment and WBEBR, and receiving a boost by means of postoperative interstitional brachytherapy (192Iridium, 15 Gy, Nucletron Afterloader, USA) implanted under general anesthesia according to the Paris system (group 2) Results: Median netto (= incision to closure) and bruto (= total time spend in the operating theatre) time in the operating theatre at primary surgery was significantly higher in group 1 (respectively 96 vs 62 min, p < 0.01, and 118 and 80 min, p <0.01). Netto and bruto time to implant the iridium wires respectively was 27 and 50 min. This means that the total theatre time was comparable in both groups (netto 96 vs 89 minutes, and bruto 148 vs 130 minutes, NS). Perioperative morbidity was slightly higher in group 1 due to a higher amount of postoperative wound infections (9/80 vs 4/100, p< 0.05). Median total surgery and radiotherapy related hospital stay for the entire treatment was 2.5 days in group 1 and 4.0 days in group 2 (p < 0.01). Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in patients receiving IEBR. Acute skin toxicity at the end of the entire treatment was significantly lower in group 1. Out of 48 evaluable patients after 6 months there were no patients with grade 4 skin toxicity in group 1. No tumor recurrences were seen in both groups after a median follow-up 10 months. Conclusions: Intraoperative radiotherapy is feasible and well tolerated in selected patients with early breast cancer. Total hospital stay is lower and patient satisfaction is higher in women having IEBR compared to PIB. Our study suggest it may be considered to give patients undergoing IEBR prophylactic antibiotic treatment.",,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was conducted between August 2008 and January 2009 on behalf of the Breast Working Party within the EORTC-ROG. The questionnaire comprised 32 questions on 4 main topics: fractionation schedules, treatment planning methods, volume definitions and position verification procedures. RESULTS: Sixty-eight institutions out of 16 countries responded (a response rate of 47%). The standard fraction dose was generally 2Gy for both breast and boost treatment, although a 2.67 Gy boost fraction dose is routinely given in British institutions. The main boost modality was electrons in 55%, photons in 47% and brachytherapy in 3% of the institutions (equal use of photon and electron irradiation in 5% of the institutions). All institutions used CT-based treatment planning. Wide variations are seen in the definition of the breast and boost target volumes, with margins around the resection cavity, ranging from 0 to 30 mm. Inverse planned IMRT is available in 27% and breath-hold techniques in 19% of the institutions. The number of patients treated with IMRT and breath-hold varied per institution. Electronic portal imaging for patient set-up is used by 92% of the institutions.

By irradiating preoperatively this can lead to more accurate tumor delineation and smaller irradiated volumes. As the tumor remains in situ during irradiation, more precise delivery of the radiation dose is guaranteed with CT cone beam linear accelerators, avoiding the uncertainties of the original tumor position in the operation cavity as is the case in postoperative RT. Tumor excision 6 weeks after RT removes the high dose volume tissue and can lead to better cosmesis. Methods and materials Patients 60 years, T < 3 cm, pN0(sn) (sentinel node procedure before RT), ductal carcinoma, unifocal on mammogram and MRI, undergo preoperative RT (CTV = GTV + 2 cm, 10 x 4 Gy IMRT/VMAT over two weeks); 6 weeks hereafter a wide local excision is performed. Skin toxicity and fibrosis is scored using EORTC/RTOG criteria. Patients are followed during RT and on a 3-monthly basis. Cosmesis is scored and photographs are taken for analysis (BCCT.core project score). Results From May 2010- 2013, 58 patients (pts) were included. For 52 pts follow up information is available up to at least 3 months after treatment; mean age 67.2 years (59-80); mean tumor size 1.4 cm (0.4-3.2); differentiation grade: grade 1 (n = 22), grade 2 (n = 28), unknown n = 8; mainly ER+PR + neu- (n = 50). 34 pts received hormonal therapy, none chemotherapy. Toxicity Acute RT toxicity grade 0 (23) grade 1(8). Postoperative complications were noted in 9/52 pts (17%): 2/52 had direct post-operative bleeding needing re-surgery; 1/52 developed a hematoma two months after surgery, needing re-surgery; 6/52 (11.5%) had a postoperative wound infection and received oral antibiotics. Of these 6; 1 wound abscess needing re-surgery; 1 small fistula closing within ten months. In the first year 9/52 pts developed localized oedema at the RT side fading away within 9 months. 4/53 pts developed hematoma post surgery. Fibrosis and cosmetic outcome Fibrosis score at 1 year (n = 35): grade 0 (9), grade 1 (21), grade 2 (4) grade 3 (1). Cosmetic outcome was scored at 1 year (n = 28): excellent/good (25; 89%), fair (3;11%). At 2 years follow up: 10/11 patients excellent/good and 1/11 patient fair. Fibrosis was noted in a limited volume. One ipsi-lateral breast tumor recurrence was diagnosed after 12 months at skin entry of the biopsy tract. Discussion The short term results of this PAPBI trial are promising in terms of acute treatment-related toxicities, complications and cosmetic outcome. Our complication rate of 17% (11% wound infection, 8% hematoma) is comparable with others*. Excellent or good cosmetic outcome was found in 90%, improving over time. Longer follow-up and increasing patient inclusion are needed to evaluate treatment efficacy, cosmetic results and toxicity on the longer term.",,0

Tumours were inoculated subcutaneously in 60 animals and resected after 21 days of growth. Immediately after removal, the operation site was exposed to 320-450 nm light of 0.1 W cm-2 and 60 J cm-2 after photosensitisation with either Photofrin (5 mg kg-1 i.v. 48 h before illumination) or 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) (2 mg ml-1 in drinking water for 9 days). Porphyrin concentrations were measured in tissue samples. After 28 days, animals treated with adjunctive PDT had a significantly longer tumour-free interval than controls (P < 0.01); median 25 days (Photofrin), 18 days (ALA), 14 days (controls). Moreover, in the PDT groups significantly fewer rats had lymph node metastasis. A prophyrin concentration ratio between tumour and mammary tissue of 2:1 was found after Photofrin and 4:1 after ALA. The results indicate that adjuvant intraoperative PDT may be a safe and effective method of destroying residual tumour, thereby preventing locoregional tumour recurrence.",eng,0
Journal Article,E. Van Limbergen,2003.0,Indications and technical aspects of brachytherapy in breast conserving treatment of breast cancer,", ","Improved local control rates have been demonstrated in retrospective studies as well as in randomised trials on brachytherapy with increasing doses to the tumour bed. The higher local control obtained by interstitial breast implants, as compared to external photon or electron beam boosts, have been mainly attributed to the higher doses actually delivered to the tumour bed by these implants for the same nominal dose as compared to external beam radiotherapy (RT). On the other hand, poor cosmesis has also been correlated with radiation dose to the breast skin (radiation teleangiectases), and breast tissue (retraction due to fibrosis), the latter depending not only on RT dose but also on the treated boost volume. For this reason, a possible benefit of interstitial implants will only be realized when the gain in local control goes together with minimal cosmetic damage. Therefore, the ballistic advantages of interstitial implants have to be maximally exploited: i.e. the treated volume should be maximally adapted to the target volume, and additional irradiation of the breast skin by the boost technique should be avoided. This paper deals in detail with the technical aspects of breast brachytherapy that seem to be relevant for high quality outcome.",eng,0

These include accelerated partial breast irradiation, intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Follow-up data of multicatheter brachytherapy accelerated partial breast irradiation and intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy confirm excellent 5-year local control rates in well selected patients. Early side effects seem to be improved, but recent data show increasing skin toxicity in multicatheter and intracavitary balloon brachytherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy, proton beam partial breast irradiation, intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy improve dose homogeneity and decrease normal tissue complication probability. For breast-only treatment, two tangential fields with different segments provide an attractive and feasible alternative to the conventional technique. The proposed intensity modulated radiotherapy techniques for comprehensive locoregional radiotherapy, however, result in increased doses to the contralateral lung and breast. SUMMARY: Input from long-term clinical data on new radiotherapy techniques is needed. Consensus on target volume contouring and dose volume constraints for nontarget tissue has not yet been reached. Further research on skin toxicity with multicatheter or intracavitary brachytherapy is needed to improve the results.",eng,0

Both the absorption and reduced scattering properties show large variations. Significant differences in optical properties between normal (glandular plus lipid rich tissue) and tumor tissues are present in 74% of all patients. However, in some cases the tumor showed lower values than normal tissue, and in other cases this was the other way around. Thus, a general trend in optical properties is not observed. However, the average absorption contrast of all patients as a function of wavelength reveals an optimal contrast peak at 650 nm.

A phase 2 study of pre-excision IORT was performed for early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: Patients > 48 years of age with invasive ductal carcinoma, < 3 cm, and clinically node-negative were eligible for this study, which was approved by institutional review board. Ultrasound was used to select electron energy and cone size to cover the tumor plus 1.5- to 2.0-cm lateral margins and 1-cm-deep margins (90% isodose). Fifteen Gy was delivered with a Mobetron irradiator, and immediate needle-localized partial mastectomy followed. Local event results were updated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients received IORT alone. Median age was 63 years, and median tumor size was 1.2 cm. Of these, 81% were positive for estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor, 11% were positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and 15% were triple-negative. Also, 42%, 49%, and 9% would have fallen into the Suitable, Cautionary, and Unsuitable groups, respectively, of the American Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology consensus statement for accelerated partial breast irradiation. Median follow-up was 69 months. Ipsilateral events occurred in 8 of 53 patients. The 6-year actuarial rate of ipsilateral events was 15% (95% confidence interval = 7%-29%). The crude event rate for Suitable and Cautionary groups was 1 of 22 (5%) and 7 of 26 (27%), respectively. Overall survival was 94.4%, and breast cancer-specific survival was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of local events in this study is a matter of concern, especially in the Cautionary group. On the basis of these findings, pre-excision IORT, as delivered in this study, may not provide adequate local control for less favorable early-stage breast cancers.

Materials/Methods: Patients age 48 or older with invasive ductal cancers smaller than 3 cm as measured on ultrasound and clinically negative lymph nodes were eligible for treatment on this IRB-approved Phase II trial. Ultrasound image was used to select electron energy and cone size sufficient to cover the tumor plus a 1.5 to 2.0 cm lateral margin and 1 cm deep margin (90% Isodose). The dose was prescribed to 15 Gy and delivered using a Mobetron irradiator. The patients then had immediate lumpectomy following the IORT.We update the local control results, using the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate time to local recurrence function and 95% confidence intervals. Results: From March 2003 to July 2007, 71 patients were treated with IORT. Median follow-up was 48 months (range, 3 - 63 months). Median age of all patients was 64 (48 - 92), median tumor size was 1.5 cm (range, 0.3 - 4.0 cm), median cone size was 5.5 cm (range, 4 - 6 cm), median electron energy used was 12 MeV (range, 6 - 12). Hormone receptor status were as follows: 46 were ER+/PR+/Her2-, 4 patients were ER+/PR-/Her2-, 12 patients were triple negative, and 8 patients were Her2 positive (1 ER+/ PR-, 3 triple positive, 4 ER-/PR-). There were 17 patients who received systemic chemotherapy, 38 patients who received hormonal therapy, and 23 patients who received no systemic therapy. For patients found to have tumors greater than 3 cm, extensive intraductal component, or positive nodes or margins, additional local therapy was delivered (7 total mastectomy, 11 whole breast radiation). Of the 53 patients who received IORTalone, 5 have experienced ipsilateral tumor recurrence, for a crude local control rate of 48 of 53 (90.5%; 95% confidence interval, 79 - 97%). The 3-year and 5-year probability of local control are 94% (95% CI, 82 - 98%) and 77% (95% CI, 46 - 92%). Of the 5 patients who recurred 3 were ER+/PR+/Her2- and 2 were triple negative. Two received tamoxifen alone, 1 received chemotherapy alone, and two received no systemic therapy. In addition there were 3 patients in the IORT alone group who died without evidence of breast cancer progression for an overall survival of 92.4%. Of the 71 patients in this trial, 23 patients (32.3%) required additional definitive treatment for local control at the time of initial therapy. Conclusions: The 10% crude rate of local failure and the 77% 5-year probability of local control are concerning. Based on these findings, preoperative IORT, as planned and delivered in this study with a 15 Gy prescription dose, may not provide adequate local control for patients with early-stage breast cancer.",,0

Materials/Methods: Between 2000 and 2010, a total of 267 pts underwent lumpectomy and IORT for early stage breast cancer. A complete dataset could be collected for 258 IORT-pts. To match the IORT cohort, 258 pts postoperatively treated with EBRT were selected, thus a total of 516 pts were analyzed. Pts were matched by age (<49, 50-59, > 60), histology (infiltrating ductal, lobular, tubular, mixed, other type and ductal carcinoma in situ), tumor size (<0.5, 0.5- 1, 1.1-2, 2.1-3, > 3 cm), grading (1, 2, 3), lymph node classes (0, 1, 2), hormone receptors, type of adjuvant therapy (none or hormone therapy vs chemotherapy), surgical margins (positive, negative, close) and treatment date. EBRT was performed with 2 tangential fields to the whole breast (50 Gy/25 fractions) and with a 9-12 MeV direct electron field boost to the tumor bed (10 Gy/5 fractions). IORT was performed on a non-dedicated Linac (green-line setup) with direct 8- 12 MeV electron fields (21 Gy prescribed to the 90% isodose). Relapse at the site of surgical intervention was classified as true local recurrence (LR). All recurrences in the treated breast (any quadrant) were classified as Ipsilateral Recurrence (IR). Results: Median follow-up was 77 months (12-156) for both groups, reflecting matched treatment dates. IR were 11 (4.2 %) after IORT and 7 (2.7%) after EBRT. LR for IORT and EBRT groups were 8 (3.1%) and 3 (1.2%), respectively. Overall survival (OS) at 3 and 5 years was 98.8% and 96.1% for IORT and 98.8% and 95.3% for EBRT (n.s.). Disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 and 5 years was 97.2% and 93.2% for IORT and 98% and 93.5% for EBRT (n.s). Between IORT and EBRT, no differences in non-breast cancer related deaths (n = 12 vs 11) or second cancer incidence (n=6 vs 5) were recorded. When patients were analyzed according to ASTRO-criteria for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), outcome was better in the APBI-suitable group than in the entire cohort: IR were 2 (1.8%) for IORT and 2 (1.8%) for EBRT. LR was 1 (0.9%) for IORT and 2 (1.8%) for EBRT and OS at 3 and 5 years remained at 99.1% and 96.1% for IORT and at 100% and 95.1% for EBRT. DFS was 99.1% and 96.5% for IORT and for EBRT 100% and 95.1% for EBRT at 3 and 5 years. Conclusions: In line with published data from randomized trials, the rate of IR was higher after IORT than after EBRT if no stringent patient selection was performed. Non-breast-cancer mortality and second cancer incidence did not differ between IORT and EBRT. In patients considered suitable for APBI according to ASTRO-criteria, IR, LR, and OS, indicating that IORT is a viable treatment paradigm after careful patient selection.",,0

Lee,2015.0,Mastectomy skin necrosis after microsurgical breast reconstruction,10.1016/j.jss.2015.03.076,"BACKGROUND: Mastectomy skin necrosis represents a significant clinical morbidity after immediate breast reconstruction. In addition to aesthetic deformity, necrosis of the native mastectomy skin may require debridement, additional reconstruction, or prolonged wound care and potentially delay oncologic treatment. This study aims to evaluate patient and procedural characteristics to identify predictors of mastectomy skin necrosis after microsurgical breast reconstruction. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all immediate microsurgical breast reconstructions performed at a single academic center. Patient records were queried for age, diabetes, active smoking, previous breast surgery, preoperative radiation, preoperative chemotherapy, body mass index, mastectomy type, mastectomy weight, flap type, autologous flap type, and postoperative mastectomy skin flap necrosis. RESULTS: There were 746 immediate autologous microsurgical flaps performed by three plastic surgeons at our institution during the study period. The incidence of mastectomy skin flap necrosis was 13.4%. Univariate analysis revealed a significantly higher incidence of mastectomy skin necrosis in patients with higher mastectomy weight (P < 0.001), higher autologous flap weight (P < 0.001), higher body mass index (0.002), and diabetes (P = 0.021). No significant association was found for age, smoking, prior breast surgery, preoperative chemotherapy or radiation, or mastectomy type. Multivariate analysis demonstrated statistically significant associations between mastectomy skin necrosis and both increasing mastectomy weight (odds ratio 1.348 per quartile increase, P = 0.009) and diabetes (odds ratio 2.356, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing mastectomy weight and coexisting diabetes are significantly associated with postoperative mastectomy skin necrosis after microsurgical reconstruction. These characteristics should be considered during patient counseling, procedure selection, operative planning, and intraoperative tissue viability assessment.",eng,0

Initial data suggest promising local control and cosmetic results in appropriately selected patients. Long-term data continue to evolve but are limited outside of the context of the American Society of Breast Surgeons Registry Trial. Methods and Materials A retrospective review of 157 patients completing APBI after breast-conserving surgery and axillary staging via high-dose-rate <sup>192</sup>Ir brachytherapy from June 2002 to December 2007 was made. APBI was delivered with a single-lumen MammoSite balloon-based applicator to a median dose of 34 Gy in 10 fractions over a 5-day period. Tumor coverage and critical organ dosimetry were retrospectively collected on the basis of computed tomography completed for conformance and symmetry. Results At a median follow-up time of 5.5 years (range, 0-10.0 years), the 5-year and 7-year actuarial incidences of ipsilateral breast control were 98%/98%, of nodal control 99%/98%, and of distant control 99%/99%, respectively. The crude rate of ipsilateral breast recurrence was 2.5% (n=4); of nodal failure, 1.9% (n=3); and of distant failure, 0.6% (n=1). The 5-year and 7-year actuarial overall survival rates were 89%/86%, with breast cancer-specific survival of 100%/99%, respectively. Good to excellent cosmetic outcomes were achieved in 93.4% of patients. Telangiectasia developed in 27% of patients, with 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year actuarial incidence of 7%/24%/33%; skin dose >100% significantly predicted for the development of telangiectasia (50% vs 14%, P<.0001). Conclusions Long-term single-institution outcomes suggest excellent tumor control, breast cosmesis, and minimal late toxicity. Skin toxicity is a function of skin dose, which may be ameliorated with dosimetric optimization afforded by newer multicatheter brachytherapy applicators and a more rigorous skin dose constraint of <100%. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",,0

It has been argued that the biological effect of large dose fractions may differ from that of conventional fraction sizes. Therefore, the biological effect of large single doses was investigated. Material/Methods: Clonogenic cell survival of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was determined after direct X-ray irradiation, irradiation of feeder cells, or transfer of conditioned medium (CM). CM was collected 24h after irradiation and directly used. Cell-cycle distributions and the apoptotic fraction (sub-G1) were measured by flow cytometry, cytokines in the CM were quantified by a cytokine antibody array. gammaH2AX foci (surrogate marker for DNA double-strand breaks) were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Results: An increase in density of MCF7 cells from 10 to 50x103 cells per flask resulted in an 8.5-fold decrease in clonogenic survival after irradiated with a single 12 Gy fraction (P<0.0001). Likewise, seeding of unirradiated MCF7 cells on 20 Gy irradiated MCF7 feeder cells resulted in a 28% reduction in colony formation (P<0.0001). A part of this effect could be attributed to a transferrable factor, as a dose-dependent reduction in colony formation was also observed in the 5-15 Gy dose range, when unirradiated or moderately (4 Gy) irradiated cells were treated with CM from irradiated cells. These observations were confirmed in MDA-MB-231 cells. While no effect of CM on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution was observed, and no differentially expressed cytokine could be identified, the transferable factor induced a significant, prolonged expression of gammaH2AX DNA repair foci at 1-12h. Conclusions: A dose-dependent non-targeted effect of irradiation on clonogenic cell survival was observed in the dose range of 5-15 Gy. The dependence of the surviving fraction on cell numbers at high doses would represent a cohort effect"" in vivo. These results support the hypothesis that non-targeted effects may contribute to the efficacy of very large dose fractions in radiation therapy.""",,0

Materials/Methods: An IRB-approved review of 165 consecutive early-stage breast cancers, treated from 1995-2005 with APBI brachytherapy, reveals 91 cases were treated with interstitial brachytherapy and 74 with balloon brachytherapy. Stage 0, I, or II cancers are eligible for APBI if a<3cm tumor resects with a negative pathologic margin and 0-3 involved nodes. High-dose-rate radiation therapy is delivered twice a day, for five days, to a total dose of 34 Gy. Follow-up at regular intervals documents history, physical examination, and mammography. Physicians use the Harvard scale to grade overall cosmesis, and toxicities, including hyperpigmentation, edema, telangiectasia, pain, surgical defect, fibrosis and fat necrosis, are graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (v3.0). Dose-volume histogram and treatment parameters are collected and analyzed. Results: Median follow-up is 59.9 months, with 40% of patients having .70 months follow-up. The median patient age at diagnosis is 70.9 years. Median tumor size is 1.1 cm. The pathologic margin is #2 mm in 57 tumors (35%). Tumors are ER+ in 76% of cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 13% of patients and 52% received hormone therapy. Locoregional control of disease is achieved in 98.2% of patients. There are three ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences (IBTR), occurring at 50, 81, and 158 months. Overall cosmetic outcome is good/excellent in 90% of patients and fair/poor in 5.4%, 8 patients have no scored cosmesis. There are 7 cases of G3-4 toxicity: 3 with fibrosis and 4 with surgical defects. The most common toxicities are fibrosis G1 (49%), G2 (13%), followed by scarring G1 (37%), G2 (2%), and surgical defects G1 (16%), G2 (6%). With few events, IBTR and cosmesis were not found to have any statistical correlation with the clinical or dosimetric parameters evaluated. Specifically, when the maximum skin dose is<120% of the prescribed dose there was no correlation with skin toxicity. Conclusions: These excellent local control rates and cosmesis support the continued use of APBI. The ASTRO Consensus guidelines for APBI requires a .2 mm pathologic margin in contrast to the NSABP B-39 criteria of no tumor at the histologic inked margin. Over a third of patients in this series have #2 mm of the margin with no increase in IBTR. In this cohort of patients with close margins, brachytherapy delivers substantial dose that achieves local control and spares the morbidity and negative cosmetic impact of additional breast surgery.",,0

Previous studies suggested that a dose of 0.62 mg (1.6 mL of 0.5 mM) ICG is optimal for SLN mapping in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of NIR fluorescence for SLN mapping in breast cancer patients when used in conjunction with conventional techniques. Study subjects were 95 breast cancer patients planning to undergo SLN procedure at either the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (Boston, MA, USA) or the Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands) between July 2010 and January 2013. Subjects underwent the standard-of-care SLN procedure at each institution using (99)Technetium-colloid in all subjects and patent blue in 27 (28 %) of the subjects. NIR fluorescence-guided SLN detection was performed using the Mini-FLARE imaging system. SLN identification was successful in 94 of 95 subjects (99 %) using NIR fluorescence imaging or a combination of both NIR fluorescence imaging and radioactive guidance. In 2 of 95 subjects, radioactive guidance was necessary for initial in vivo identification of SLNs. In 1 of 95 subjects, NIR fluorescence was necessary for initial in vivo identification of SLNs. A total of 177 SLNs (mean 1.9, range 1-5) were resected: 100 % NIR fluorescent, 88 % radioactive, and 78 % (of 40 nodes) blue. In 2 of 95 subjects (2.1 %), SLNs-containing macrometastases were found only by NIR fluorescence, and in one patient this led to upstaging to N1. This study demonstrates the safe and accurate application of NIR fluorescence imaging for the identification of SLNs in breast cancer patients, but calls into question what technique should be used as the gold standard in future studies.",eng,0

Despite its benefits, some women will be troubled by breast edema. Breast edema may cause an unsatisfactory cosmetic result, influencing the quality of life. The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate the incidence of breast edema and to identify risk factors of breast edema in breast cancer patients following BCS and radiotherapy. A systematic literature search was performed using different electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase) until June 2014. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) research studies that included female breast cancer patients who were treated with BCS and radiotherapy and (2) studies that investigated the incidence of breast edema and/or risk factors of breast edema. Exclusion criteria were (1) reviews or case studies and (2) studies published before 1995. We identified in total 28 papers which represented 4,011 patients. There was a great variation in the incidence of breast edema (0-90.4 %). We identified several possible risk factors for breast edema namely increasing irradiated breast volume, increasing boost volume, the use of a photon boost, increasing breast separation, a higher density of the breast tissue, a large tumor, a higher specimen weight, postoperative infection, acute postoperative toxicity, and diabetes mellitus. However, their prognostic value remains uncertain. Breast edema is a common complaint after BCS and radiotherapy. A number of possible risk factors associated with breast edema were identified, but further research is warranted. Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2000 to 2005, patients treated with BCT for invasive breast cancer (BC) were included. An electron boost (EB) was performed for a superficial boost-volume (less than 29 mm under the epidermis), in all other cases a brachytherapy boost (BTB) was proposed. When patients refused a BTB or it was not possible for technical reasons, a photon boost (PB) was given. The primary endpoints were local and loco-regional recurrences. Secondary endpoints were metastasis-free and overall survival. RESULTS: 1379 patients were eligible for analysis. Most patients (1052) received an EB, 225 a BTB and 76 a PB. At a median follow-up of 8.8 years, 35 (2.5%) patients developed a local or loco-regional recurrence. Ten years local relapse-free rate was 97.9%. No differences between boost techniques were observed in relapse risk, metastasis-free and overall survival after multivariate analyses.

As CD44v6 is frequently expressed in DCIS, we used near-infrared fluorescently labeled CD44v6-targeting antibodies for detection of DCIS. PROCEDURE: Mice bearing orthotopically transplanted CD44v6-positive MCF10DCIS DCIS-like tumors and CD44v6-negative MDA-MB-231 control tumors were intravenously injected with IRDye800CW conjugated to CD44v6-specific antibodies or control IgGs. Noninvasive imaging was performed for 8 days postinjection, followed by intraoperative imaging. Antibody accumulation and intratumor distribution were examined. RESULTS: Maximum accumulation of CD44v6-specific antibodies was obtained 24 h postinjection. Maximum tumor-to-background ratio for MCF10DCIS tumors was 4.5 +/- 0.2, compared to 1.4 +/- 0.1 (control tumors, p = 0.006), and 1.7 +/- 0.1 (control IgG, p = 0.014), for 8 days postinjection. Ex vivo, tumor-to-background ratios were comparable to those obtained by intraoperative imaging.

The possible effects of implants on cancer incidence, diagnosis, and treatment usually generate a disarming confusion. The present paper represents an update of the more recent oncologic and surgical strategies, aiming to support plastic and general surgeons in such challenging aspects. Several aspects of breast cancer management in augmented women are investigated, including (1) risk estimation and cancer characteristics, stage at diagnosis, and prognosis; (2) cancer diagnosis with clinical examination, mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging; (3) cancer treatment including breast conservation, intraoperative radiotherapy, sentinel node biopsy and mastectomy, and reconstruction. A brief resume of recommendations and conclusions is suggested, elucidating correct trends in the oncologic management of augmented patients and refusing well-established misconceptions: (1) breast augmentation does not increase the risk of breast cancer incidence, and it does not influence the prognosis; (2) possible risks exist in cancer detection due to technical difficulties; (3) sentinel lymph node detection is feasible; (4) intraoperative radiotherapy represents a good chance for conserving treatment; (5) immediate reconstruction with submuscular-subfascial implants is the most common procedure after mastectomy, and biological substitutes could support this procedure. Breast clinicians should be alerted because of high expectations of this subgroup of patients, accustomed to emphasize the aesthetic result.

Recent study findings show that most local recurrences are in the scar tissue area suggesting that whole-breast RT may not always be necessary. If the volume of breast tissue to be irradiated is limited, RT may be performed intraoperatively. Intraoperative RT delivered with electrons at the total isodose of 2100 rad (21 Gy) could in principle substitute the currently used radiation course of external RT after breast-conserving surgery in selected cases. Patients and Methods: We report our findings on intraoperative RT using a specially designed mobile linear accelerator delivering 4 energy levels of electrons (3, 5, 7, and 9 MeV) via a head maneuvered by a robot arm. We applied this technique to 237 patients with breast cancer (mean age, 59 years; age range, 33-80 years) with tumors smaller than 2 cm in maximum diameter (T1); most underwent wide resection and an axillary sentinel node biopsy. Results: After a median follow-up of 19 months (range, 7-33 months), the rate of posttreatment complications is very low. Four patients (1.7%) developed breast fibrosis-mild in 3 patients and severe in 1 patient-that resolved in 24 months. Three patients (1.4%) developed ipsilateral breast cancer-2 (1.0%) contralateral breast cancer, 1 (0.5%) supraclavicular node metastasis, and 1 (0.5%) distant metastases. Conclusions: Intraoperative RT with electron beams reduces irradiation to the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and contralateral breast and lung. It appears to be a promising method for irradiating conservatively treated breasts and it avoids the long period of postoperative RT that may not be easily accessible to all patients.",,1

The rationale for the use of this segmental radiation therapy in place of whole-breast irradiation is based on the finding that approximately 85% of breast relapses are confined to the same quadrant of the breast as the primary tumor. Phase I and II trials have demonstrated no increase in postsurgical complication rates following the use of single-dose IORT in localized breast cancers. Longer follow-up is needed to assess the cosmetic outcome. Clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of IORT in the treatment of breast cancer are currently under way at the European Institute of Oncology (EIO) at the University of Milan, Italy, and at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York. Here we report the two different techniques in use in these trials.",,0

As a result, the detection of small clinically occult (nonpalpable) lesions has progressively increased. At present in our institution some 20% of the cases are treated when nonpalpable. The aim of the present study is to analyze the characteristics and prognosis of such tumors treated in a single institution. METHODS: The analysis focused on 1,258 women who presented at the European Institute of Oncology with a primary clinically occult carcinoma between 2000 and 2006. All patients underwent radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL), axillary dissection when appropriate, whole breast radiotherapy, or partial breast intraoperative irradiation and received tailored adjuvant systemic treatment. RESULTS: Median age was 56 years. Imaging showed a breast nodule in half of the cases and a breast nodule accompanied by microcalcifications in 9%. Microcalcifications alone were present in 17.1% of the cases, whereas suspicious opacity, distortion, or thickening represented the remaining 24.6%. Most tumors were characterized by low proliferative rates (68.9%), positive estrogen receptors (92.3%), and non-overexpressed Her2/neu (91.3%). After a median follow-up of 60 months, we observed 19 local events (1.5%), 12 regional events (1%), and 20 distant metastases (1.6%). Five-year overall survival was 98.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically occult (nonpalpable) carcinomas show very favorable prognostic features and high survival rates, showing the important role of modern imaging techniques.",eng,0

We developed a procedure of PBI consisting of a single high dose of radiotherapy of 21 Gy with electrons equivalent to 58-60 Gy in fractionated doses, delivered during the surgical session by a mobile linear accelerator, positioned close to the operating table. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 1999 to December 2006, 1246 patients with primary carcinoma of less than 2.5-cm maximum diameter, mostly over 48 years, were treated with electron intra-operative radiotherapy (ELIOT) at a single dose of 21 Gy. RESULTS: After a follow-up from 0.3 to 94.7 months (median 26), 24 (1.9%) patients showed a local recurrence and 22 developed distant metastases. Sixteen patients died, seven from breast carcinoma and nine from others causes. The five-year crude survival was 96.5%. Six (0.5%) developed severe breast fibrosis, which resolved in 2-3 years. An additional 40 patients suffered for mild fibrosis. Cosmetic results were good. CONCLUSIONS: Electron intra-operative radiotherapy is a safe method for treating conservatively operated breasts and avoids the long period of post-operative radiotherapy, greatly improving the quality of life and reduces the cost of radiotherapy. ELIOT markedly reduces the radiation to normal surrounding tissues and deep organs. Results on short- and medium-term toxicity are good. Data on local control are encouraging.",eng,1

The results on 1,822 patients treated from January 2000 to December 2008 are reported. Women with unicentric primary breast carcinoma of less than 2.5 cm in the largest diameter were assessed by imaging. All patients were treated with breast-conserving surgery (quadrantectomy). ELIOT was delivered by two mobile linear accelerators immediately after breast resection with a single dose of 21 Gy. Local side effects of ELIOT were mainly liponecrosis (4.2%) and fibrosis (1.8%).

The main objective of postoperative radiotherapy should be the sterilisation of residual cancer cells in the operative area, while irradiation of the whole breast may be avoided. We have developed a new technique of intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT) of a breast quadrant after the removal of the primary carcinoma. A mobile linear accelerator (linac) with a robotic arm is utilised delivering electron beams able to produce energies from 3 to 9 MeV. Through a perspex applicator, the radiation is delivered directly to the mammary gland and to spare the skin from the radiation, the skin margins are stretched out of the radiation field. To protect the thoracic wall, an aluminium-lead disc is placed between the gland and the pectoralis muscle. Different dose levels were tested from 10 to 21 Gy without important side-effects. We estimated that a single fraction of 21 Gy is equivalent to 60 Gy delivered in 30 fractions at 2 Gy/fraction. Seventeen patients received a dose of IORT of 10 to 15 Gy as an anticipated boost to external radiotherapy, while 86 patients received a dose of 17-19-21 Gy intra-operatively as their whole treatment. The follow-up time of the 101 patients varied from 1 to 17 months (mean follow-up time was 8 months). The IORT treatment was very well accepted by all of our patients, either due to the rapidity of the radiation course in cases where IORT was given as the whole treatment or to the shortening of the subsequent external radiotherapy in cases where IORT was given as an anticipated boost. We believe that single dose IORT after breast resection for small mammary carcinomas may be an excellent alternative to the traditional postoperative radiotherapy. However, a longer follow-up is needed for a better evaluation of the possible late side-effects. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",,1

However, its ability to control for recurrence of local disease required confirmation in a randomised controlled trial. Methods: This study was done at the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy). Women aged 48-75 years with early breast cancer, a maximum tumour diameter of up to 2.5 cm, and suitable for breast-conserving surgery were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (using a random permuted block design, stratified for clinical tumour size [<1.0 cm vs 1.0-1.4 cm vs >1.5 cm]) to receive either whole-breast external radiotherapy or intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons. Study coordinators, clinicians, and patients were aware of the assignment. Patients in the intraoperative radiotherapy group received one dose of 21 Gy to the tumour bed during surgery. Those in the external radiotherapy group received 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2 Gy, followed by a boost of 10 Gy in five fractions. This was an equivalence trial; the prespecified equivalence margin was local recurrence of 7.5% in the intraoperative radiotherapy group. The primary endpoint was occurrence of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrences (IBTR); overall survival was a secondary outcome. The main analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01849133. Findings: 1305 patients were randomised (654 to external radiotherapy and 651 to intraoperative radiotherapy) between Nov 20, 2000, and Dec 27, 2007. After a medium follow-up of 5.8 years (IQR 4.1-7.7), 35 patients in the intraoperative radiotherapy group and four patients in the external radiotherapy group had had an IBTR (p<0.0001). The 5-year event rate for IBRT was 4.4% (95% CI 2.7-6.1) in the intraoperative radiotherapy group and 0.4% (0.0-1.0) in the external radiotherapy group (hazard ratio 9.3 [95% CI 3.3-26.3]). During the same period, 34 women allocated to intraoperative radiotherapy and 31 to external radiotherapy died (p=0.59). 5-year overall survival was 96.8% (95% CI 95.3-98.3) in the intraoperative radiotherapy group and 96.9% (95.5-98.3) in the external radiotherapy group. In patients with data available (n=464 for intraoperative radiotherapy; n=412 for external radiotherapy) we noted significantly fewer skin side-effects in women in the intraoperative radiotherapy group than in those in the external radiotherapy group (p=0.0002). Interpretation: Although the rate of IBTR in the intraoperative radiotherapy group was within the prespecified equivalence margin, the rate was significantly greater than with external radiotherapy, and overall survival did not differ between groups. Improved selection of patients could reduce the rate of IBTR with intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons.

Journal Article,C. Vetter; T. Lasser; T. Wendler; N. Navab,2011.0,1D-3D registration for functional nuclear imaging,", ","Functional nuclear imaging systems like PET or SPECT provide unique information that is used extensively in diagnosis, but it has also proven very useful for image-guided interventions. In the case of SPECT and radio-guided surgeries, 1D gamma detectors called gamma probes are routinely used during interventions to localize hotspots in conjunction with pre-operative SPECT images, or more recently, intraoperative SPECT images. As the tissue is being manipulated during surgery, these SPECT images quickly lose their validity, necessitating either new scans, which is in most cases unfeasible, or requiring the surgeon to do a mental update of the available imagery. In this paper, we present a novel 1D-3D registration procedure for functional nuclear imaging that registers tracked intra-operative 1D probe readings to a pre- or intra-operatively acquired 3D functional image. This procedure allows incorporating prior knowledge during radio-guided surgeries, enabling rapid updates of the visualization in the case of tissue deformation without the overhead of an additional complete scan. We show results using phantom data as well as patient data.",eng,0

The recent publication of several randomized trials comparing APBI to standard WBI provides Level I evidence supporting APBI. The purpose of this review is to summarize the Level I data supporting APBI in an effort to provide guidance when to offer this treatment approach vs. standard WBI, AWBI, or excision alone and to address questions related to its application. Four contemporary trials with over 2000 patients comparing APBI and WBI have been published and demonstrate no differences in the rates of local/regional recurrence or survival though long-term followup is limited to one study. In addition, reductions in the rates of acute and chronic toxicity and improvements in cosmetic outcome were noted in two of these trials (the University of Florence and the Hungarian Phase III trials, respectively). When contrasting other treatment approaches to APBI, patients treated in studies using AWBI have many comparable clinical and pathologic characteristics, whereas studies investigating endocrine therapy alone (surgery with no adjuvant radiation therapy) have much lower risk"" patients based on clinical, pathologic, and treatment-related criteria. Although significant Level I evidence now exists supporting the use of APBI as an alternative to WBI in selected patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy, additional data are needed to (1) help further refine patient selection criteria, (2) better clarify the optimal partial breast irradiation target and technique for each clinical setting, (3) determine when AWBI, standard WBI, or excision alone may be more appropriate, and (4) investigate if further reductions in fractionation schedules are possible.""",eng,0

The impact of this isotope on the rate of local control and cosmetic outcome in patients with early stage breast cancer treated with interstitial implants for their irradiation boost"" remains to be defined. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We reviewed the treatment outcome of 402 consecutive cases of Stage I and II breast cancer undergoing breast conserving therapy between 1/1/80 and 12/31/87. All patients underwent excisional biopsy and received 45-50 Gy to the entire breast followed by a boost to the tumor bed using either electrons (104 patients), photons (15 patients), or an interstitial implant with either iridium-192 (197 patients) or iodine-125 (86 patients) to at least 60 Gy. Iodine-125 implants were primarily performed in patients with significant risk factors for local recurrence (71%) or in patients with large breasts (17%). Local tumor control and cosmetic outcome were assessed and contrasted between patients boosted with each modality. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 59.3 months, 18 (4.5%) patients developed a recurrence of the tumor in the treated breast (4.4% 5-year actuarial rate). No statistically significant differences in the 5-year actuarial rate of local recurrence were noted between patients boosted with either iodine-125 (3.0%), iridium-192 (3.8%), electrons (5.4%), or photons (0%). Likewise, no significant differences in the percentage of patients obtaining good/excellent cosmetic results were noted between iodine-125 (93%), iridium-192 (88%), electrons (90%), or photons (82%). CONCLUSION: We conclude that patients with Stage I and II breast cancer undergoing breast conserving therapy and judged to be candidates for boosts with interstitial implants can be effectively treated with iodine-125 seeds. Use of this isotope results in less patient and personnel irradiation exposure and a better dose distribution than iridium-192, since dose optimization can be routinely employed. Overall, local control and cosmetic outcome have been excellent and are similar to either iridium-192, electrons, or photons.""",eng,0

Patient demographics, technical reproducibility, cosmesis, and early toxicity were evaluated. METHODS: From May 4, 2002 through July 30, 2004, 1419 patients with Stage 0, I, or II breast carcinoma who were undergoing breast-conserving therapy were enrolled on the trial. The device was placed in 1403 of these patients. The 1237 patients (87% of enrolled patients) who received accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) (34 grays prescribed to 1.0 cm in 10 fractions; 95% of patients who received APBI) constituted the study population; 86% of those patients (1068) had Stages I-II breast carcinoma (median tumor size, 10 mm), and 14% of those patients (169) had Stage 0 breast carcinoma. Ninety-one percent of the patients with invasive carcinoma (977 of 1068 patients) had negative lymph node status, and 99% of all patients had negative margins. The median patient age was 65 years. Systemic chemotherapy alone was administered to 79 patients with invasive carcinoma (7%), hormone therapy was administered to 501 patients (45%), and both were administered to 39 patients (4%). The median follow-up was 5 months. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-four catheters (45%) were placed with an open cavity at the time of lumpectomy, and 683 catheters (55%) were placed with a closed cavity after lumpectomy. Skin spacing ranged from 2 mm to 75 mm (median, 10 mm). In 89% of patients, there was a minimum balloon-to-skin distance of 7 mm (2% of patients had distances < 5 mm). In terms of cosmetic assessment, 95% of patients (1030 of 1084 patients) who had a cosmetic assessment had a good/excellent result (last follow-up visit). Cosmetic results at 12 months were good/excellent in 92% of 248 evaluable patients. The median skin spacing (> or = 7 mm vs. < 7 mm) was associated significantly with a good/excellent cosmetic result (96.1% vs. 86.8%; P = 0.0001) overall and at 6 months (P = 0.006). Increasing skin spacing was associated with a good/excellent cosmetic result as a continuous variable (P < 0.0001). In total, 92 of 1140 evaluable patients (8.1%) developed an infection in the breast, which was device-related in 5.3% of patients (60 of 1140 patients). Good/excellent cosmetic results were noted in 86% of these patients (last follow-up visit). Fifteen of 442 evaluable patients (3.4%) developed a radiation recall reaction. Good/excellent cosmetic results were noted in 93% of these patients at their last follow-up visit. One local recurrence (0.1%) was reported (new primary carcinoma). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical evaluation of the ability of the MammoSite breast brachytherapy catheter to deliver APBI demonstrated acceptable technical reproducibility between multiple institutions and use in appropriate groups of patients.

Material and methods: CT-based 3D planning with dose optimization was performed for all patients. For the study, new ideal dosimetric goals were developed: 1) > 95% of the prescribed dose (PD) covering > 90% of the target volume (TV), 2) a maximum skin dose < 125% of the PD, 3) maximum rib dose < 145% of the PD, and 4) the V150 < 50 cc and V200 < 10 cc. The frequency of concurrently achieving these dosimetric goals using the Contura<sup></sup> MLB was investigated. Results: 194 cases were evaluable. Employing the MLB, all ideal dosimetric criteria were achieved in 76% of cases. Evaluating dosimetric criteria separately, 90% and 89% of cases met the new ideal skin and rib dose criteria, respectively. In 96%, ideal TV coverage goals were achieved and in 96%, dose homogeneity criteria (V150 and V200) were met. For skin spacing > 5-7 mm, the median skin dose was 121% of the PD and when < 5 mm, the median skin dose was 124.4%. For rib distancees < 5 mm, the median rib dose was reduced to 136.4% of the PD. For skin spacing < 7 mm and distance to rib < 5 mm, the median skin and rib doses were concurrently limited to 121% and 142.8% of the PD, respectively. Conclusions: The Contura<sup></sup> MLB catheter provides potential improvements in dosimetric capabilities (i.e., reduced skin and rib doses and improved TV coverage) in many clinical scenarios.",,0

Martinez,1997.0,Long-term outcome with interstitial brachytherapy in the management of patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy,", ","PURPOSE: We reviewed our institution's experience with interstitial implant boosts to determine their long-term impact on local control and cosmetic results. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1987, 390 women with 400 cases of Stage I and II breast cancer were managed with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) at William Beaumont Hospital. All patients were treated with an excisional biopsy and 253 (63%) underwent reexcision. Radiation consisted of 45-50 Gy external beam irradiation to the whole breast followed by a boost to the tumor bed to at least 60 Gy using either electrons [108], photons [15], or an interstitial implant [277] with either 192Ir [190] or 125I [87]. Long-term local control and cosmetic outcome were assessed and contrasted between patients boosted with either interstitial implants, electrons, or photons. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 81 months, 25 patients have recurred in the treated breast for a 5- and 8-year actuarial rate of local recurrence of 4 and 8%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the 5- or 8-year actuarial rates of local recurrence using either electrons, photons, or an interstitial implant. Greater than 90% of patients obtained a good or excellent cosmetic result, and no statistically significant differences in cosmetic outcome were seen whether electrons, photons, or implants were used. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients with Stage I and II breast cancer undergoing BCT and judged to be candidates for boosts can be effectively managed with LDR interstitial brachytherapy. Long-term local control and cosmetic outcome are excellent and similar to patients boosted with either electrons or photons.",eng,0

Martinez,1998.0,Implementation of 3D-virtual brachytherapy in the management of breast cancer: a description of a new method of interstitial brachytherapy,", ","PURPOSE: We present the initial description of a new technique of interstitial breast brachytherapy in which a computer-generated image of an implant template is applied virtually to serial-computed tomography (CT) scan images of a patient's breast. Optimal placement of the virtual template around the CT images of the proposed target volume provides the physician with a preplan for improved positioning of implant needles around the actual target volume intraoperatively. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Since March of 1993, 110 patients with early-stage breast cancer were entered onto a protocol of low or high dose rate brachytherapy as the sole radiation modality for part of their breast-conserving therapy. To improve the accuracy and reproducibility of target volume coverage in patients with a closed lumpectomy cavity, 11 of these implants were performed using the virtual brachytherapy technique. The virtual implant procedure was performed by first placing radiopaque skin markers on the breast surface for reference on the CT image and ultimately as intraoperative landmarks for the placement of implant needles. A CT scan of the breast was then performed and the target volume outlined on each CT scan slice by the physician. A virtual image of the brachytherapy template was then positioned around the CT image of the target volume to achieve an idealized implant with optimal coverage. The projected entrance and exit points of all needles on the skin of the breast (from the idealized virtual implant) were then identified (by perspective rendering of multiple 3D views) and hard-copy images taken to the operating room. The implant was then constructed by referencing the virtual implant images (needle entrance and exit points) to the radiopaque skin markers on the breast. After the implant was completed, a CT scan of the breast with the template catheters or needles in position was taken for comparison of the actual target volume coverage with the virtual implant generated preoperatively. RESULTS: Intraoperative ultrasound was used to check the real-time position of the afterloading needles in reference to the chest wall and posterior border of the target volume. No adjustment of needles was required in any of the 11 patients. Assessment of target volume coverage between the virtual implant and the actual CT image of the implant showed excellent agreement. In each case, all target volume boundaries specified by the physician were adequately covered. The total number of implant planes, intertemplate separation, and template orientation were identical between the virtual and real implant. CONCLUSION: We conclude that 3D virtual brachytherapy may offer an improved technique for accurately performing interstitial implants of the breast with a closed lumpectomy cavity in selected patients. Although preliminary results show excellent coverage of the desired target volume, additional patients will be required to establish the reproducibility of this technique and its practical limitations.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 1,440 patients (1,449 cases) with early-stage breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving therapy were treated with balloon-based brachytherapy to deliver APBI (34 Gy in 3.4-Gy fractions). Cosmetic outcome was evaluated at each follow-up visit and dichotomized as excellent/good (E/G) or fair/poor (F/P). Follow-up was evaluated at 36 and 72 months to establish long-term cosmesis, stability of cosmesis, and factors associated with optimal results. RESULTS: The percentage of evaluable patients with excellent/good (E/G) cosmetic results at 36 months and more than 72 months were 93.3% (n = 708/759) and 90.4% (n = 235/260). Factors associated with optimal cosmetic results at 72 months included: larger skin spacing (p = 0.04) and T1 tumors (p = 0.02). Using multiple regression analysis, the only factors predictive of worse cosmetic outcome at 72 months were smaller skin spacing (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.99) and tumors greater than 2 cm (OR, 4.96, CI, 1.53-16.07). In all, 227 patients had both a 36-month and a 72-month cosmetic evaluation. The number of patients with E/G cosmetic results decreased only slightly from 93.4% at 3 years to 90.8% (p = 0.13) at 6 years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: APBI delivered with balloon-based brachytherapy produced E/G cosmetic results in 90.4% of cases at 6 years. Larger tumors (T2) and smaller skin spacing were found to be the two most important independent predictors of cosmesis.",eng,0
Journal Article,F. A. Vicini; L. Kestin; P. Chen; P. Benitez; N. S. Goldstein; A. Martinez,2003.0,Limited-field radiation therapy in the management of early-stage breast cancer,", ","BACKGROUND: Several phase III trials have demonstrated equivalent long-term survival between breast conserving surgery plus radiation therapy and mastectomy in patients with early-stage breast cancer but have not provided information on the optimal volume of breast tissue requiring post-lumpectomy radiation therapy. Therefore, we examined the 5-year results of a single institution's experience with radiation therapy limited to the region of the tumor bed (i.e., limited-field radiation therapy) in selected patients treated with breast-conserving therapy and compared them with results of matched breast-conserving therapy patients who underwent whole-breast radiation therapy. METHODS: A total of 199 patients with early-stage breast cancer were treated prospectively with breast-conserving therapy and limited-field radiation therapy using interstitial brachytherapy. To compare potential differences in local recurrence rates based on the volume of breast tissue irradiated, patients in the limited-field radiation therapy group were matched with 199 patients treated with whole-breast radiation therapy. Match criteria included tumor size, lymph-node status, patient age, margins of excision, estrogen receptor status, and use of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Local-regional control and disease-free and overall survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the statistical significance of differences between treatment groups was calculated using the log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Median follow-up for surviving patients was 65 months (range = 12-115 months). Five ipsilateral breast failures (i.e., recurrences) were observed in patients treated with limited-field radiation therapy. The cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0% to 2.8%). On matched-pair analysis, the rate of local recurrence was not statistically significantly different between the patient groups (1% [95% CI = 0% to 2.4%] for the whole-breast radiation therapy patients versus 1% [95% CI = 0% to 2.8%] for the limited-field radiation therapy patients; P =.65). CONCLUSIONS: Limited-field radiation therapy administered to the region of the tumor bed has comparable 5-year local control rates to whole-breast radiation therapy in selected patients.",eng,0

In the Breast Cancer Study Group of AIRO (Italian Society of Radiation Oncology) a survey has been carried on in the year 2013 (from the beginning of January to the end of September) to assess the use and the characteristics of hypofractionated regimens in Italy. Materials and Methods: A short questionnaire was sent to all Italian Radiotherapy Centers. First of all, it was asked to report if hypofractionated RT was applied. The other items investigated: the possibility of selection criteria, such as patient' age and tumour hystology; the schedule adopted (total dose, dose/fraction, number of fractions/week), the use of concomitant or sequential boost and its schedule. The data were compared with those collected in a previous survey, carried on in the years 2009-2010 in the Italian Radiotherapy Centers. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 132 Centers over 175, representing a large and significant proportion of the Italian Radiotherapy Centers. Hypofractionated RT is applied in 100 Centers (75.8%) and more than one regimen is used in some of them (overall 107 forms were collected). In 40 out of 107 forms (37.4%), age is not used as a selection criteria, in 5 (4.7%) it is not indicated, while in 62 (57.9%) different age cut-offs are specified (from 40 to 75 years). In 56 treatment regimens (52%) all hystological types are treated; in 36 (34%) only invasive cancers; in 11 (10%) only invasive ductal carcinomas. Total dose ranges from 28.5 to 50 Gy; dose per fraction varies from 2.25 to 5.70 Gy and the number of fractions varies between 5 and 22. The majority of the hypofractionated RT regimens include the boost (80/107), which is delivered sistematically in 61 of them (57%) and only according to specific criteria (age, margin status) in 14 of them (13.1%). Boost dose and fractionation show a wide range (from 0.25 Gy in case of concomitant boost up to 10 Gy for IORT). In the previous Italian survey (years: 2009-2010), only 33 Centers completed the questionnaire and 28 of them (84.8%) applied whole breast hypofractionation. The dose per fraction range is wider in the current survey (2.25 - 5.70 Gy vs. 2.25 - 3.40 Gy), indicating a trend toward dose escalation. Furthermore, more Centers now use the boost on the tumour bed in comparison with the previous study (74.8% vs. 60.7%). Conclusions: This survey is representative of the Italian radiation oncology reality and of the regional distribution and points out that whole breast hypofractionated RT is becoming more and more widespread in Italy. Apart from less protracted schedules being more convenient for patients, such a reduction in the number of fractions in a large group of cases, represents an advantage for Health Service and society, by decreasing the pressure on machine time and human resources, especially if they are limited.",,0

The purpose of this study was to quantify dose absorbed within the partial mastectomy cavity and surrounding tissue. STUDY DESIGN: This prospectively collected data was retrospectively reviewed to evaluate actual dose absorbed versus the intent of 20 Gy per treatment. Skin exposure to radiation was also evaluated above and below the applicator site using radiochromic film. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients have been treated with IORT since inception of the program in October of 2012. The first 11 patients were treated before the use of radiochromic film for in vitro measurement of dose absorbed by the tumor bed, and thus were ineligible for evaluation. Of the 67 remaining patients, one was excluded from analysis as a result of surgeon oversight in placing radiochromic film within the breast cavity. Another was excluded due to mechanical malfunction, resulting in less than one minute of radiation therapy. The measured dose of radiation absorbed by the breast cavity in the remaining 65 patients was 19.08 +/- 3.08 Gy, and the superior and inferior skin exposure was measured to be 2.36 +/- 1.29 Gy and 2.22 +/- 0.93 Gy, respectively. A final patient was excluded after being administered a radiation dose 4 standard deviations below the mean. Recalculating the data with this final patient excluded, the measured radiation mean within the breast cavity was 19.54 +/- 1.58 Gy, with skin measurements of 2.29 +/- 1.28 Gy and 2.23 +/- 0.89 Gy superiorly and inferiorly respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, it appears that IORT delivers the prescribed 20 Gy to the partial mastectomy cavity, while virtually eliminating tissue toxicity to surrounding skin with levels of radiation less than those currently accepted in conventional whole breast irradiation. The use of radiochromic film has been shown to be a practical, reproducible, and cost effective method of ensuring minimal tissue damage and establishing a permanent record of intracavity and skin dose delivery.",,0

AIMS: To conduct a case-control study comparing disease control, cosmesis, and complications in patients with EBC undergoing APBI using multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy vs those receiving conventional whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT). SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Women with EBC fulfilling the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) criteria were selected as 'cases' if treated with APBI or as 'controls' if offered WBRT during the period from May 2000 to December 2004. MATERIALS AND METHODS: APBI patients were treated with high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR) to a dose of 34 Gy/10#/6-8 days. WBRT was delivered to the whole breast to a dose of 45 Gy/25# followed by tumor bed boost, either with electrons (15 Gy/6#) or interstitial brachytherapy (HDR 10 Gy/1#). RESULTS: At the median follow-up of 43.05 months in APBI and 51.08 months in WBRT there was no difference in overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), late arm edema, and symptomatic fat necrosis between the two groups. However, APBI resulted in increase in mild breast fibrosis at the tumor bed. Telangiectasias were observed in three patients of the APBI group.

However, it must be acknowledged that any such treatment has no detectable impact upon survival, and the value of all such interventions must be considered in the context of the individual patient's non-cancer life expectancy and the complex psychosocial factors that affect older patients.If no impact on survival can be expected and the risk of local recurrence is high enough to warrant some post-operative treatment, the most powerful agent in this respect is radiotherapy. Whilst adjuvant endocrine treatment is becoming increasingly accepted as monotherapy in low risk patients, we propose that radiotherapy should not be forgotten as an alternative which, with its attendant benefits of shorter duration and high compliance, may be more suitable for a number of patients. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,0

Over the last century our understanding of the biology of radiation exposure as well as our ability to safely deliver extraordinarily high doses of radiation to specific targets has led to its routine use in both curative and palliative settings for most solid tumors. External radiation beam techniques invariably involve irradiating normal tissues that are located between the radiation source and the intended target. High-energy linear accelerators have greatly reduced skin and subcutaneous radiation-induced injury; however, radiation tolerances of organs adjacent to the target do frequently limit the total amount of radiation that can be used. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) can be delivered in a number of ways, with the ultimate intent of minimizing normal tissue exposure to potentially harmful doses of radiation. Multiple IORT delivery modalities are now available, all of which present potential advantages and disadvantages over other methods of treatment. The specific techniques, radiobiologic considerations, and clinical uses of IORT will be described. © 2012 Begell House, Inc.",,0

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 7 patients, totaling 11 implants, who underwent breast reconstruction with the DIEP flap and subsequent mammoplasty. All cases underwent previous mastectomies. No implant placement was offered at the time of their DIEP flap reconstruction. Immediate breast reconstruction with the DIEP flap was performed in 9 cases, whereas 2 required delayed reconstruction secondary to postmastectomy radiotherapy. No patients received postreconstruction radiotherapy. Breast asymmetry and inadequate volume were the primary indications for mammoplasty. For all cases, we used smooth, round silicone gel implants, which were placed in the subpectoral region. RESULTS: Mean age was 43 years. One patient was actively smoking. Four patients underwent bilateral implant placement. The mean time of delay between breast reconstruction and mammoplasty was 61 weeks. Average volume of silicone implants was 229 mL. A medial pedicle vertical mastopexy was performed in 1 patient on a nonreconstructed breast to achieve symmetry. Five patients underwent nipple reconstruction. All patients underwent delayed mammoplasty without intraoperative complications and good aesthetic results. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed mammoplasty following DIEP flap breast reconstruction is a safe and feasible procedure for patients who seek an aesthetic and natural-looking breast but lack adequate abdominal tissue.",eng,0

Perforator selection and flap design were based solely on preoperative multidetector-row computed tomographic angiography (MDCTA) of the areas adjacent to the soft tissue defects. METHODS: Between January 2009 and June 2014, 15 patients with large, unstable keloids subject to recurrent inflammation and infections and with a history of multiple failed treatments underwent surgical excision and early postoperative radiation therapy. The defects were located in the upper abdomen (n = 6) or lower sternum (n = 9). All patients underwent preoperative MDCTA for perforator localization. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients underwent keloid removal followed by IMAP (n = 10) and SEAP (n = 6) flap coverage combined with early postoperative low-dose radiation therapy (350 cGy/5 fractions/5 days or 400 cGy/4 fractions/4 days). Flap sizes ranged from 9 x 5 to 17 x 6 cm. Only one IMAP flap developed a 2 x 2 cm tip necrosis, which was managed with dressing changes. The remaining flaps healed uneventfully with no keloid recurrence at 23.4 months. In all cases, the perforator location determined by preoperative MDCTA was precisely consistent with the intraoperative findings. CONCLUSION: The sixth IMAP and SEAP flaps combined with early postoperative radiation therapy provided a valid and feasible approach for the surgical treatment of large keloids in the lower sternal and upper abdominal. MDCTA enabled detailed preoperative assessment of the perforators, facilitating both flap design and dissection, and saving operating time. Although longer follow-up is required, these preliminary results are encouraging.",eng,0

Positron emission tomography (PET) and/or optical imaging of LNs was performed in three different animal models including a hind limb inflammation model, an orthotropic breast cancer model, and a metastatic breast cancer model. In all three models, the LNs can be distinguished clearly by the apparent blue color and strong fluorescence signal from EB as well as a high-intensity PET signal from (18)F-AlF-NEB. The lymphatic vessels between the LNs can also be optically visualized.

The latest Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group systemic review confirmed 75% reduction of local recurrence risk after radiotherapy. A dose-response relationship has also been demonstrated in EORTC 22881-10882 boost versus no boost trial"" where significantly fewer local failure(p<0,0001). Intraopertive radiotherapy is one of the boost method base on irradiating the surgical field immediately after tumor is remove. Whereas often a geographic miss in covering the boost target occurs with external beam boost, the purpose of IORT is to cover the tumor bed safely. The aim of the study was to analyze the therapy and cosmetic effects, acute and late toxicity and analysis of the quality of live questionnaires made by the patients. Materials: Sixty patients with breast cancer in stage Tis-2N0-1A treated with IORT after conserving surgery were randomized. Definitive pathology results showed ductal-invasive histology in 49 patients (81,7%). The intraoperatively delivered dose was 10 Gy prescribe to the applicator surface, using 4-12 MV electrons. We use aluminum-lead shielding disc to protect the thoracic wall, heart and lung during radiotherapy. In 26 patients (43,3%) we also use 0,5-1cm bolus. Median of the dose dept was 1,97cm. In all cases IORT was followed by EBRT with total dose of 50Gy in 2 Gy fractions. During 12 months observation in 1, 6 and 12 month every patient was physical examinated with photos of the breast and analysis of acute and late toxicity. Every patient made also the quality of live questionnaires ( QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23) during observation. Six months after EBRT mammography with ultrasounds of the breast was made in all patients. Results: No local recurrence occurred during 12 months observation. The IORT combination with EBRT was well tolerated, with no Grade 3 and 4 skin acute and late toxicities. Acute reactions in Grade 1 and 2 of the skin were observed in 23,3% of patients. The cosmetic outcome in physical examination was good to excellent in 78,3% of patients after 12 months. In quality of live questionnaires after 1, 6 and 12 months of observation 83,3% of patients evaluated the effect of the therapy as good and very good. Pain in the breast and more sensitivity of the skin estimated in 35% of patient after 1, 6 and 12 months. Edema of the breast was observed in 14% of patients after 1 month and in 16% after 6 and 12 months. Changes in the skin were assessed in 36% of patients after 1 month and in 22% after 6 and 12 months of observation. Conclusions: Intraoperative radiotherapy is a comfortable, effective method of delivering a single high-dose to the tumor-bed as a boost. The external beam course afterwards is shortened by 1 week. After tumor resection the tumor bed can be ideally adapted to the applicator surface and then treated by electron. A miss of the boost target volume can be avoided through IORT, as it is often in EBRT.""",,0

Relevant studies that have contributed to guide the treatment of this heterogeneous disease in the field of breast screening, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are highlighted. Mammography and ultrasound are the main methods of breast screening. MRI and tomosynthesis are emerging as new screening tools for a selected group of breast cancer patients. From a surgical perspective, oncoplastic techniques and neoadjuvant chemotherapy are improving cosmetic results in breast-conserving surgery. For high-risk patients, controversies still remain regarding prophylactic mastectomies. Finally, the appropriate management of the axilla continues evolving with the increasing role of radiotherapy as an alternative treatment to axillary dissection.

All patients were included in routine follow-ups (>/=3 years) with mammography accompanied by ultrasound. By retrospective consensus reading the mammographic changes in the tumour bed were classified as absent, low or distinct. Using the same grading it was classified whether mammographic evaluation was complicated due to postoperative changes. Focusing the yearly follow-ups within a period of four years, distinct changes were found significantly more often after IORT (52-62% vs. 7-30%). After IORT the evaluation was significantly more often distinctly complicated in each follow-up, except for year 1 (16-21% vs. 0-8%). In the IORT group the distribution of findings was nearly stable over time. In the control group it changed over time and a distinctly complicated evaluation was no longer seen in the follow-ups of years 3 and 4. Overall, further non-routine diagnostic procedures due to unclear findings in the tumour bed became necessary in 7% (IORT) vs. 8% (control group) of the patients (p=0.86). Evaluation of mammograms is complicated after IORT. In contrast to conventionally treated patients postoperative changes and difficulties of evaluation do not decrease over time. Overall, after IORT the diagnostic uncertainty does not seem to be increased in ultrasound supported mammographic follow-ups. The topic needs further evaluation with larger study samples.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: MBT patient data were prospectively recorded into a quality assurance database. Departmental and electronic records were reviewed to extract patient-, treatment-, and outcome-specific data. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with development of any seroma including the subset of clinically significant seroma (CSS). CSS was defined as a symptomatic seroma requiring multiple aspirations, biopsy, and/or excision. Variables analyzed included age, weight, number of excisions, time from resection to catheter placement, placement technique, balloon volume, dosimetric factors, and postbrachytherapy infection. RESULTS: MBT was performed in 109 patients, of whom 97 had minimum 6 months (median, 36) post-MBT follow-up or earlier development of seroma. All patients received 34 Gy to 1cm depth from balloon surface, delivered twice daily in 10 fractions. Seroma developed in 41% of patients at a median of 3 months (range, 0.1-25) post-MBT. One-third of seromas (13% of all patients) were CSS. The only factor identified as statistically significant for development of any seroma was catheter placement on day of resection vs. > or =1 day later (59% vs. 33%; p = 0.0066). Post-MBT infection was highly statistically significant for development of CSS (64% vs. 7%; p<0.0001). Prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of post-MBT infection from 37.5% to 6% (p = 0.011).

The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect of ipsilateral arm position on postplan dosimetry. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients treated at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre were included in this study. Patients underwent two postimplant CT scans on the day of implant (Day 0) and two scans approximately 8 weeks later (Day 60). One scan at each time was taken with the ipsilateral arm raised, recreating the planning scan position, and the other with both arms down in a relaxed position beside the body, recreating a more realistic postimplant arm position. Postplans were completed on all four scans using deformable image registration (MIM Maestro). RESULTS: On the Day 0 scan, the V200 for the evaluation planning target volume was significantly increased in the arm-down position compared with the arm-up position. Lung, rib, and chest wall dose were significantly reduced at both time points. Left anterior descending coronary artery, heart, and skin dose showed no significant differences at either time point. CONCLUSIONS: Although some dosimetric indices show significant differences between the arm-up and arm-down positions, the magnitude of these differences is small and the values remain indicative of implant quality. Despite the delivery of the majority of dose with the arm down, it is reasonable to use CT scans taken in the arm-up position for postplanning.",eng,0

Journal Article,S. Weber; F. K. Storm; J. Stitt; D. M. Mahvi,1997.0,The role of frozen section analysis of margins during breast conservation surgery,", ","PURPOSE: The role of frozen section analysis during breast conservation surgery is undefined. Assessment of margins using permanent section evaluation is the standard method of ensuring complete tumor excision. If the margin is positive, however, surgical re-excision is necessary to reduce the likelihood of subsequent local recurrence. Therefore, biopsy of the surgical cavity with immediate pathological evaluation during lumpectomy was performed to evaluate the effect on local recurrence, the number of re-excisions, and cosmesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty patients underwent attempted lumpectomy with frozen section margin determination. One hundred forty patients were available for long-term follow-up (mean = 57 months, median = 46 months). All patients underwent attempted breast conservation surgery, which consisted of tumorectomy with excision of a greater than 1-cm rim of grossly normal tissue. Tumor margins were obtained by intraoperative biopsy with frozen section analysis of the lumpectomy cavity walls. RESULTS: In 21 patients (15%), frozen section analyses (FSA) revealed positive margins, resulting in immediate re-excision. In seven of these patients (5%), margins were persistently positive, and these patients therefore underwent mastectomy. Fourteen patients were successfully re-excised to a negative margin. The sensitivity and specificity of FSA were 91% and 100%, respectively. Five percent of patients definitively managed by lumpectomy with FSA of margins recurred locally. The mean cosmesis score after radiotherapy was 7.0 out of a possible 10, correlating with a good to excellent result. DISCUSSION: The accuracy of FSA, low recurrence rate, avoidance of reoperation, and good cosmesis indicate that intraoperative frozen section analysis should be adopted as a safe and effective method of margin analysis during breast conservation surgery.",eng,0

METHODS: A retrospective dosimetric comparison of interstitial HDR brachytherapy, MammoSiteTM balloon brachytherapy, and 3D-CRT was performed. Thirty patients including 10 from each treatment technique were included for a dosimetric comparison of the dose received by the ipsilateral breast, PTV, heart, and ipsilateral lung. Interstitial patients were treated with 4 Gy in 8 fractions to 32 Gy, and the MammoSiteTM patients were treated with 3.4 Gy in 10 fractions to 34 Gy. 3D-CRT patients were treated with 3.85 Gy in 10 fractions to 38.5 Gy using multiple isocentric beams. The CT images from simulation or implant evaluation were transferred into our 3D treatment planning software. The lumpectomy cavities were outlined for every patient, except the MammoSiteTM patients, where the cavity was defined by the balloon edge. The PTV was constructed as a uniform expansion of 1.5 cm for all interstitial HDR patients, 1.0 cm for the MammoSiteTM patients, and a 1.0 cm expansion in addition to the CTV expansion of 1.0 cm (n = 2), and 1.5 cm (n = 8) for the 3D-CRT patients. The CTV expansion for 3D-CRT and the PTV expansion for the brachytherapy patients were limited to the chest wall and skin. Normal structures including both ipsilateral lung and breast and heart for left-sided lesions were outlined. The lumpectomy cavity was subtracted from the PTV and normal breast tissue for evaluation. To evaluate dose to the ipsilateral breast and lung, PTV, and heart, a dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis was performed. All histograms were normalized to the volume of the structure (i.e., expressed as percent volume). RESULTS: The average percentage of the breast receiving 100% and 50% of the prescribed dose (PD) was higher in the 3D-CRT group (24% and 48%, respectively) compared with the MammoSiteTM (5% and 18%, respectively) and interstitial patients (10% and 26%, respectively). Improved coverage of the PTV was noted in the 3D-CRT plans compared with the MammoSiteTM and interstitial HDR plans. With the interstitial HDR technique, 58% of the PTV received 100% of the PD compared with 76% with MammoSiteTM and 100% with 3D-CRT techniques. The percentage of the PTV receiving 90% of the PD was 68%, 91%, and 100% for the interstitial HDR, MammoSiteTM, and 3D-CRT patients, respectively. The ipsilateral lung V20 was slightly higher for 3D-CRT at 5% compared with 0% for both brachytherapy techniques. CONCLUSION: In those treated with 3D-CRT, coverage of the PTV was better with 3D-CRT but varied with the definition used. At the coverage at 90% of the PD, no difference was observed between 3D-CRT and MammoSiteTM (which were both better than interstitial). 3D-CRT resulted in better coverage of the PTV compared with MammoSiteTM or interstitial brachytherapy techniques. Better PTV coverage with 3D-CRT came at the cost of a higher integral dose to the remaining normal breast. Dosimetrically, the best partial breast irradiation technique appears to depend on the clinical situation. Of the brachytherapy techniques, MammoSiteTM appears to be superior in PTV coverage. When comparing MammoSiteTM vs. 3D-CRT PTV coverage at 90% of the PD, the difference was not significantly different. © 2005 American Brachytherapy Society. All rights reserved.",,0

Fenster,2005.0,Oblique needle segmentation and tracking for 3D TRUS guided prostate brachytherapy,10.1118/1.2011108,"An algorithm was developed in order to segment and track brachytherapy needles inserted along oblique trajectories. Three-dimensional (3D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images of the rigid rod simulating the needle inserted into the tissue-mimicking agar and chicken breast phantoms were obtained to test the accuracy of the algorithm under ideal conditions. Because the robot possesses high positioning and angulation accuracies, we used the robot as a gold standard,"" and compared the results of algorithm segmentation to the values measured by the robot. Our testing results showed that the accuracy of the needle segmentation algorithm depends on the needle insertion distance into the 3D TRUS image and the angulations with respect to the TRUS transducer, e.g., at a 10 degrees insertion anglulation in agar phantoms, the error of the algorithm in determining the needle tip position was less than 1 mm when the insertion distance was greater than 15 mm. Near real-time needle tracking was achieved by scanning a small volume containing the needle. Our tests also showed that, the segmentation time was less than 60 ms, and the scanning time was less than 1.2 s, when the insertion distance into the 3D TRUS image was less than 55 mm. In our needle tracking tests in chicken breast phantoms, the errors in determining the needle orientation were less than 2 degrees in robot yaw and 0.7 degrees in robot pitch orientations, for up to 20 degrees needle insertion angles with the TRUS transducer in the horizontal plane when the needle insertion distance was greater than 15 mm.""",eng,0

Since the molecular causes for fibrosis are largely unknown, we analyse if epigenetic regulation might explain inter-individual differences in fibrosis risk. DNA methylation profiling of dermal fibroblasts obtained from breast cancer patients prior to irradiation identifies differences associated with fibrosis. One region is characterized as a differentially methylated enhancer of diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKA). Decreased DNA methylation at this enhancer enables recruitment of the profibrotic transcription factor early growth response 1 (EGR1) and facilitates radiation-induced DGKA transcription in cells from patients later developing fibrosis. Conversely, inhibition of DGKA has pronounced effects on diacylglycerol-mediated lipid homeostasis and reduces profibrotic fibroblast activation. Collectively, DGKA is an epigenetically deregulated kinase involved in radiation response and may serve as a marker and therapeutic target for personalized radiotherapy.",,0

IORT can be used either as a tumor bed boost followed by external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or as single treatment in prospective studies (eg, TARGIT). In a matched cross-sectional study, we assessed long-term quality of life (QoL) in patients with early breast cancer treated with BCS and/or IORT and/or EBRT. Methods: QoL was compared in 23 patients treated with IORT, 23 patients treated with IORT + EBRT, and 23 patients treated with EBRT. Patients were matched on age and time interval since BCS, and had similar demographic and clinical characteristics. IORT was given with 50-kV x-rays (INTRABEAM TM system, Carl Zeiss Surgical, Oberkochen/Germany) delivering 20 Gy at the applicator surface. EBRT (46-50 Gy in 2-Gy fractions in the IORT + EBRT group, and 56 Gy in 2-Gy fractions in the EBRT group) was initiated after completion of wound healing and/or chemotherapy. The mailed questionnaires included the EORTC QLQ-C30 (cancer- specific QoL; range, 0-100), EORTC QLQ-BR23 (breast-cancer-specific QoL; range, 0-100), FACT-F (fatigue), HADS (anxiety and depression), Rosenberg scale (global self-esteem), and body image scale (range, 0-30). With 18 to 70 months of follow-up, all patients were disease free. Results: There were only few differences between the 3 groups. In general, IORT + EBRT was not significantly different from EBRT. There was a nonsignificant trend toward more pain (42.8 +/- 32.9 vs 27.5 +/- 34.7) and reduced QoL (57.6 +/- 20.7 vs 70.3 +/- 23.9). IORT alone had a comparable QoL (70.3 +/- 23) and less breast symptoms (8.6 +/- 12.3 vs 19.2 +/- 23.8) and body image concerns (1.7 +/- 3.3 vs 2.3 +/- 3.7) compared to EBRT (P = n.s.). IORT alone induced significantly less breast symptoms (8.6 +/- 5.3 vs 26.1 +/- 27.6, P = 0.01) and pain (23.9 +/- 24.5 +/- 42.8 +/- 32.9, P = 0.04), compared to IORT + EBRT. Conclusions: Patients with breast cancer after BCS + IORT +/- EBRT present with comparable QoL like patients receiving EBRT without a boost.",,0

This study reports on the effects of IORT on radiation-related quality of life (QoL) parameters.Methods: Two hundred and thirty women with stage I-III breast cancer (age, 31 to 84 years) were entered into the study. A single-center subgroup of 87 women from the two arms of the randomized phase III trial TARGIT-A (TARGeted Intra-operative radioTherapy versus whole breast radiotherapy for breast cancer) was analyzed. Furthermore, results were compared to non-randomized control groups: n = 90 receiving IORT as a tumor bed boost followed by external beam whole breast radiotherapy (EBRT) outside of TARGIT-A (IORT-boost), and n = 53 treated with EBRT followed by an external-beam boost (EBRT-boost). QoL was collected using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires C30 (QLQ-C30) and BR23 (QLQ-BR23). The mean follow-up period in the TARGIT-A groups was 32 versus 39 months in the non-randomized control groups.Results: Patients receiving IORT alone reported less general pain (21.3 points), breast (7.0 points) and arm (15.1 points) symptoms, and better role functioning (78.7 points) as patients receiving EBRT (40.9; 19.0; 32.8; and 60.5 points, respectively, P < 0.01). Patients receiving IORT alone also had fewer breast symptoms than TARGIT-A patients receiving IORT followed by EBRT for high risk features on final pathology (IORT-EBRT; 7.0 versus 29.7 points, P < 0.01).

There are several technical approaches that are clinically established, e.g. brachytherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), or external-beam radiotherapy. The understanding of the underlying biology, optimal technical procedures, patient selection criteria, and imaging changes during follow-up has increased enormously. After completion of several phase III trials using brachytherapy or IORT, APBI is currently increasingly used either in phase IV studies, registries, or in selected patients outside of clinical studies. Consensus statements about suitable patients are available from several international and national societies like ASTRO, ESTRO, and DEGRO. One may expect that 15-25% of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery may qualify for APBI, i.e. patients with small invasive ductal breast cancer without clinical lymph node involvement.

The test was for non-inferiority with an acceptable margin of 2.5% in absolute terms. We reported that the Kaplan Meier estimate of local recurrence at 4 years was not statistically different in the two treatment policies.We have since had further 9 months of follow up (Feb 2011) and the total number of recurrences in the index breast has increased from 13 to 21. We performed a blinded analysis and calculated the Kaplan-Meier estimate of local recurrence for the whole cohort and compared it with a similar estimate in May 2010. The Kaplan- Meier estimate of local recurrence has remained stable but now has narrower confidence intervals: Feb 2011: 1.09% (95% CI 0.65 1.85) compared with May 2010: 1.08% (95% CI 0.33 -1.96) at 4 years and Feb 2011: 1.97% (95% CI 1.20 - 3.21) compared with May 2010: 1.85% (95% CI 0.93 - 3.69) at 5 years.Furthermore, radiation-related quality of life data was collected using two validated questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-BR23) in patients from one center (Mannheim). The response rate was 72% (n = 88). Compared to WBRT patients, IORT patients reported significantly less pain, breast and arm symptoms and better role functioning (mean 21+/-33 vs 41+/-32, 7+/-14 vs 19+/-20, 15+/-22 vs 33+/-29, and 79+/-35 vs 62+/-28 points).This update analysis demonstrates that the local recurrence rate has remained stable and the 5-year K-M estimates have not changed significantly with longer follow up. Furthermore, better quality of life was observed after IORT as compared to WBRT.",,0

We analyzed the German cohort of patients, which was supposed to be more homogeneous than the international cohort (older, low risk [smaller tumors] patients due to legal restrictions for radiation therapy studies in Germany, prepathology IORT only, homogeneous treatment in EBRT arm). Materials/Methods: TARGIT-A was a randomized trial in patients >50 years with invasive ductal carcinoma (<2 cm) undergoing breast conserving surgery comparing Standard fractionated whole breast EBRT (56 Gy) with single dose TARGIT (20 Gy) immediately after tumor excision / at the time of the primary operation. The experimental arm mandated additional EBRT (46 Gy, excluding a boost, n = 126) if adverse features were detected on final pathology (EIC, N+, margin <1 cm) making this a risk-adapted policy"". Median follow-up was 2 years and 5 months. Results: Seven hundred thirty-four patients recruited from 7 centers in Germany. Patient's ages were 70 years (12%).

We report the first 5 years of a single-center experience after introduction of a novel approach to deliver IORT as a tumor bed boost during BCS for breast cancer. Methods and Materials: A total of 155 breast cancers in 154 women (median age, 63 years; range, 30-83 years; T1/T2 = 100/55; N0/N+ = 108/47) were treated between February 2002 and December 2007 at the University Medical Center Mannheim, in whom IORT as tumor bed boost was applied using 50-kV X-rays (20 Gy) followed by 46-50 Gy whole-breast external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT).

We analyzed the influence of the interval between an IORT boost and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) on late toxicity. Methods: Forty-eight patients received 20 Gy IORT (50 kV X-rays (Intrabeam, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) followed by 46-50 Gy EBRT with a median interval of 36 days (14-197). Late toxicity was assessed with the modified LENT SOMA score after a median of 36 months. Results: Twelve patients developed a higher grade fibrosis (degreeII-III), three teleangiectases, one a breast edema grade degreeII, six retractions, four hyperpigmentations and five pain (degreeII-III). The median interval between IORT and EBRT was significantly shorter in these patients (n = 18) compared to the 30 patients without higher grade toxicity (29.5 days vs. 39.5 days, p = 0.023, Mann-Whitney U-test). Conclusion: Starting EBRT about 5-6 weeks after IORT appears to be associated with a decreased risk of chronic late toxicity compared with a shorter interval. The impact on local recurrence of prolonged gaps between IORT and EBRT is not known. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",,0

This prospective, multicentric single arm phase II study (NCT01299987 ) is based on the experimental arm of the randomized protocol of the international TARGIT A study. Here we present the first outcome analysis from the German centers. Methods: 273 patients from 20 German centers were recruited between February 2011 and September 2014. Forty-one patients were excluded from the analysis because of screening failure, drop-out or loss to follow-up. During breast conserving surgery a single dose of 20 Gy of intraoperative radiotherapy was given using the INTRABEAM system (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany). Additional postoperative WBRT (46 - 50 Gy) was prescribed only in patients with risk factors (larger size, other histology, free margin < 1 cm, lymphvessel invasion, positive nodes, multifocality/multicentricity, extensive intraductal component (EIC)). Systemic therapy was given according to international standards. The primary outcome was local relapse. Overall survival was a secondary outcome. Discontinuation of the trial is scheduled if rates of local relapse rates rise to 3/4/6% after 2.5/5/7.5 years. Results: After a median follow-up of 18.0 months in 232 patients, one ipsilateral in-breast recurrence and two deaths (non-breast cancer) were observed resulting in an actuarial local relapse free survival of 99.1% and actuarial overall survival of 98.4% after 2.5 years. Conclusions: The results of the prospective TARGIT E trial consolidate earlier reports from the randomized TARGIT A trial supporting the use of accelerated partial breast radiotherapy (APBI) in selected patients. The observed local relapse rate after 2.5 years is well below the prospectively defined stopping rules (Neumaier et al. BMC Cancer 2012). Further follow-up will be performed.",,0

Tissue compliance meter (TCM), a non-invasive applicator, may render a more reproducible tool for measuring RIF. In this study, we prospectively quantify RIF after intracavitary brachytherapy (IB) accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with TCM and compare it with LENT-SOMA. Thirty-nine women with American Joint Committee on Cancer Stages 0-I breast cancer, treated with lumpectomy and intracavitary brachytherapy delivered by accelerated partial breast irradiation (IBAPBI), were evaluated by two raters in a prospective manner pre-IBAPBI and every 6 months post-IBAPBI for development of RIF, using TCM and LENT-SOMA. TCM classification scale grades RIF as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe, corresponding to a change in TCM (DeltaTCM) between the IBAPBI and nonirradiated breasts of </=2.9, 3.0-5.9, 6.0-8.9, >/=9.0 mm, respectively. LENT-SOMA scale employs clinical palpation to grade RIF as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. Correlation coefficients-Intraclass (ICC), Pearson (r), and Cohen's kappa (kappa)-were employed to assess reliability of TCM and LENT-SOMA. Multivariate and univariate linear models explored the relationship between RIF and anatomical parameters [bra cup size], antihormonal therapy, and dosimetric factors [balloon diameter, skin-to-balloon distance (SBD), V150, and V200]. Median time to follow-up from completion of IBAPBI is 3.6 years (range, 0.8-4.9 years). Median age is 69 years (range, 47-82 years). Median breast cup size is 39D (range, 34B-44DDD). Median balloon size is 41.2 cc (range, 37.6-50.0 cc), and median SBD is 1.4 cm (range, 0.2-5.5 cm). At pre-IBAPBI, TCM measurements demonstrate high interobserver agreement between two raters in all four quadrants of both breasts ICC >/= 0.997 (95% CI 0.994-1.000). After 36 months, RIF is graded by TCM scale as 0, 1, 2, and 3 in 10/39 (26%), 17/39 (43%), 9/39 (23%), and 3/39 (8%) of patients, respectively. DeltaTCM >/=6 mm (moderate-severe RIF) is statistically different from DeltaTCM </=3 mm (none-mild RIF) (p < 0.05). At 36 months post-IBAPBI, TCM measurements for two raters render ICC = 0.992 (95% CI 0.987-0.995) and r = 0.983 (p < 0.0001), whereas LENT-SOMA demonstrates kappa = 0.45 (95% CI 0.18-0.80). SBD and V150 are the only factors closest to 0.05 significance of contributing to RIF. This prospective study indicates that TCM is a more reproducible method than LENT-SOMA in measuring RIF in patients treated with IBAPBI. This tool renders a promising future application in assessing RIF.",eng,0

Treatment records as well as hospital and outpatient charts of 49 patients with brain metastases between 2008 and 2012 who underwent S + Cs-131 (n = 24) and S + SRS (n = 25) were retrospectively reviewed. Hospital charges were compared for the single treatment in question. Means and curves of survival time were defined by the Kaplan-Meier estimator, with the cost analysis focusing on the time period of the relevant treatment. Quality adjusted life years (QALY) and Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated for each treatment option as a measure of cost-effectiveness. The direct hospital costs of treatments per patient were: S + Cs131 = $19,271 and S + SRS = $44,219. The median survival times of S + Cs-131 and S + SRS were 15.5 and 11.3 months, and the 12 month survival rates were 61 % and 49 % (P = 0.137). The QALY for S + SRS when compared to S + Cs-131 yielded a p < 0.0001, making it significantly more cost-effective. The ICER also revealed that when compared to S + Cs-131, S + SRS was significantly inferior (p < 0.0001). S + Cs-131 is more cost-effective compared with S + SRS based on hospital charges as well as QALYs and ICER. Cost effectiveness, in addition to efficacy and risk, should factor into the comparison between these two treatment modalities for patients with surgically resectable brain metastases.

Schwartz,2014.0,Phase I/II study of resection and intraoperative cesium-131 radioisotope brachytherapy in patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases,10.3171/2014.3.jns131140,"OBJECT: Resected brain metastases have a high rate of local recurrence without adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) remains the standard of care with a local control rate > 90%. However, WBRT is delivered over 10-15 days, which can delay other therapy and is associated with acute and long-term toxicities. Permanent cesium-131 ((131)Cs) implants can be used at the time of metastatic resection, thereby avoiding the need for any additional therapy. The authors evaluated the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a novel therapeutic approach with permanent (131)Cs brachytherapy at the resection for brain metastases. METHODS: After institutional review board approval was obtained, 24 patients with a newly diagnosed metastasis to the brain were accrued to a prospective protocol between 2010 and 2012. There were 10 frontal, 7 parietal, 4 cerebellar, 2 occipital, and 1 temporal metastases. Histology included lung cancer (16), breast cancer (2), kidney cancer (2), melanoma (2), colon cancer (1), and cervical cancer (1). Stranded (131)Cs seeds were placed as permanent volume implants. The prescription dose was 80 Gy at a 5-mm depth from the resection cavity surface. Distant metastases were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or WBRT, depending on the number of lesions. The primary end point was local (resection cavity) freedom from progression (FFP). Secondary end points included regional FFP, distant FFP, median survival, overall survival (OS), and toxicity. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 19.3 months (range 12.89-29.57 months). The median age was 65 years (range 45-84 years). The median size of resected tumor was 2.7 cm (range 1.5-5.5 cm), and the median volume of resected tumor was 10.31 cm(3) (range 1.77-87.11 cm(3)). The median number of seeds used was 12 (range 4-35), with a median activity of 3.82 mCi per seed (range 3.31-4.83 mCi) and total activity of 46.91 mCi (range 15.31-130.70 mCi). Local FFP was 100%. There was 1 adjacent leptomeningeal recurrence, resulting in a 1-year regional FFP of 93.8% (95% CI 63.2%-99.1%). One-year distant FFP was 48.4% (95% CI 26.3%-67.4%). Median OS was 9.9 months (95% CI 4.8 months, upper limit not estimated) and 1-year OS was 50.0% (95% CI 29.1%-67.8%). Complications included CSF leak (1), seizure (1), and infection (1). There was no radiation necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The use of postresection permanent (131)Cs brachytherapy implants resulted in no local recurrences and no radiation necrosis. This treatment was safe, well tolerated, and convenient for patients, resulting in a short radiation treatment course, high response rate, and minimal toxicity. These findings merit further study with a multicenter trial.",eng,0

A number of cohort studies suggest that hypofractionation may be given to the whole breast safely and with good local control. Recent randomized trials have confirmed that hypofractioned whole-breast irradiation is equivalent to more conventional whole-breast irradiation with respect to local recurrence and cosmetic outcome. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in hypofractionation for the delivery of partial-breast irradiation using a number of techniques including high-dose rate brachytherapy, 3-dimensional conformal radiation using external-beam techniques, and intraoperative therapy. Early cohort studies report good local control and acceptable morbidity. Randomized trials are now underway to compare this approach to conventional whole-breast irradiation.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligibility included stage I/II unifocal breast cancer <3 cm in size after lumpectomy with negative surgical margins and 0 to 3 positive axillary nodes without extracapsular extension. The APBI dose delivered was 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions over 5 days for high-dose-rate (HDR); and 45 Gy in 3.5 to 5 days for low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy. The primary endpoint was HDR and LDR MCT reproducibility. This analysis focuses on long-term ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR), contralateral breast cancer events (CBE), regional recurrence (RR), and distant metastases (DM), disease-free, and overall survival. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 12.1 years. One hundred patients were accrued from 1997 to 2000; 98 were evaluable; 65 underwent HDR and 33 LDR MCT. Median age was 62 years; 88% had T1 tumors; 81% were pN0. Seventy-seven percent were estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive; 33% received adjuvant chemotherapy and 64% antiendocrine therapy. There have been 4 isolated IBRs and 1 IBR with RR, for 5.2% 10-year IBR without DM. There was 1 isolated RR, 1 with IBR, and 1 with a CBE, for 3.1% 10-year RR without DM. The 10-year CBE rate was 4.2%, with 5 total events. Eleven patients have developed DM, 8 have died of breast cancer, and 22 have died from other causes. The 10-year DFS and OS rates are 69.8% and 78.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This multi-institutional, phase 2 trial studying MCT-APBI continues to report durable in-breast cancer control rates with long-term follow-up.",eng,0
Journal Article,J. R. White; J. F. Wilson,1997.0,Brachytherapy and breast cancer,", ","Brachytherapy has been an important component of radiation therapy for breast cancer. It played a historical role in the development of breast-conserving techniques for early-stage breast cancer. The primary use for brachytherapy in this setting has been to deliver a localized boost dose of radiation to the lumpectomy bed after whole breast radiation therapy. In recent years, there has been less utilization of brachytherapy as a boost technique. This is predominantly related to wider availability of electrons for delivering a boost dose. Another significant factor for the decline is the controversy of whether routine boosting of the tumor bed is necessary for all early-stage breast cancer patients after conservative surgery and whole breast radiation therapy. Despite this, brachytherapy is still the preferred boost technique in certain subsets of patients. Newer applications of brachytherapy for the treatment of breast cancer have emerged and have shown promise. For early-stage breast cancer, these include brachytherapy as the sole radiation modality after lumpectomy and in combination with local excision as an alternative to mastectomy for treatment of local recurrences after conservative surgery and radiation therapy. In selected locally advanced cases of breast cancer, brachytherapy has been used as part of a technique that attempts breast conservation. At this time, these newer uses of brachytherapy for the treatment of breast cancer remain investigational.",eng,0

The current TG-43 protocol ignores the effects of tissue heterogeneities on dose distributions from low energy sources (<50keV). One alternative dose calculation method is Monte Carlo (MC) dosimetry, which can accurately calculate dose distributions in realistic patient geometries such as those derived from CT imaging. A miniature low energy electronic x-ray source, Xoft Axxent, is currently used for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Recent literature indicates the importance of properly segmenting adipose and mammary tissue for breast dose calculation with low energy photons. The purpose of this study is to highlight the importance of proper tissue segmentation, applicator modeling and radiation transport in APBI by reporting the dose discrepancies stemming from the usage of TG-43 dosimetry. Materials and Methods: GEANT4.9.5 was used to simulate dose distributions in an APBI patient geometry. Patient CT images were voxelized and segmented into various tissues based on a breast modeling scheme. The balloon applicator was modeled using manufacturer's data. The source was a phase space file derived from the validated source model. The MC simulations were calculated using the original treatment parameters; source strength, dwell positions and times. The MC dosimetric indices (PTVand skin) were compared to the TG-43 treatment plan. Results: A validation simulation using a water-based geometry agreed to within 1% of the treatment plan's D90. The patient geometry was scored in dose to water in medium (Dw,m) and compared, as a ratio, against the TG-43 plan (Dw,w) (figure). All dose indices demonstrate a decrease in Dw,m compared to Dw,w on the order of 10-30%. The TG-43 D90 is reduced by 20% in Dw,m. The D0.1cc for the skin showed a 30% reduction when recalculated in MC. Individual tissues types segmented (Figure) show dose variations with closely neighboring tissues of different types, especially glandular and adipose. The wall of the balloon applicator reduces the dose fluence considerably due to the presence of barium sulfate (A high-Z material). Further inaccuracies can be attributed to replacement of water backscatter with air/lung tissue. Figure. Top Right: Isodose comparison of MC-based(solid lines) versus TG-43-based dosimetry(dashed lines) Bottom: Ratio of Dw,w to Dw,m Black line denotes PTV. Dose to air is reported as zero. Top left: HU-based tissue segmentation of the breast. Conclusions: Results indicate that effects of under-dosing on the dose distribution for Dw,m compared to Dw,w. This study demonstrates the need for more comprehensive dosimetry model to the current TG-43 dose formulation. (Figure Presented).",,0

TG-186 highlights shortcomings in the water-based approach in TG-43, particularly for low energy brachytherapy sources. The Xoft Axxent is a low energy (<50 kV) brachytherapy system used in accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Breast tissue is a heterogeneous tissue in terms of density and composition. Dosimetric calculations of seven APBI patients treated with Axxent were made using a model-based Monte Carlo platform for a number of tissue models and dose reporting methods and compared to TG-43 based plans. Methods: A model of the Axxent source, the S700, was created and validated against experimental data. CT scans of the patients were used to create realistic multi-tissue/heterogeneous models with breast tissue segmented using a published technique. Alternative water models were used to isolate the influence of tissue heterogeneity and backscatter on the dose distribution. Dose calculations were performed using Geant4 according to the original treatment parameters. The effect of the Axxent balloon applicator used in APBI which could not be modeled in the CT-based model, was modeled using a novel technique that utilizes CAD-based geometries. These techniques were validated experimentally. Results were calculated using two dose reporting methods, dose to water (D <inf>w,m</inf>) and dose to medium (D<inf>m,m</inf>), for the heterogeneous simulations. All results were compared against TG-43-based dose distributions and evaluated using dose ratio maps and DVH metrics. Changes in skin and PTV dose were highlighted. Results: All simulated heterogeneous models showed a reduced dose to the DVH metrics that is dependent on the method of dose reporting and patient geometry. Based on a prescription dose of 34 Gy, the average D<inf>90</inf> to PTV was reduced by between ~ 4% and ~ 40%, depending on the scoring method, compared to the TG-43 result. Peak skin dose is also reduced by 10%-15% due to the absence of backscatter not accounted for in TG-43. The balloon applicator also contributed to the reduced dose. Other ROIs showed a difference depending on the method of dose reporting. Conclusions: TG-186-based calculations produce results that are different from TG-43 for the Axxent source. The differences depend strongly on the method of dose reporting. This study highlights the importance of backscatter to peak skin dose. Tissue heterogeneities, applicator, and patient geometries demonstrate the need for a more robust dose calculation method for low energy brachytherapy sources. © 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",,0

Reniers,2012.0,Influence of high atomic number elements in human tissue in dosimetry for low energy photon brachytherapy,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed14&AN=70837126","Purpose/Objective: Low energy brachytherapy sources such as I-125, Pd-103 and electronic brachytherapy sources (EBS) interact with tissue via the photoelectric effect, which is highly dependant on atomic number (Z) of the tissue. Tissue is composed mostly of H, C, N, and O with higher Z trace elements (weight fraction below 1%), like Na, P and K. The amount of trace element varies not only from tissue to tissue but also from person to person. Cancerous tissue has shown a tendency to contain a higher concentration of trace elements compared to healthy tissue (Kwiatek et al., 2005). We aimed to determine the dosimetric impact of these trace elements in human tissues for low energy photon sources used in brachytherapy. Materials and Methods: Monte Carlo dose calculations were used to investigate the dosimetric effect of trace elements present in normal and cancerous human tissues. The effect of individual traces (atomic number Z=11 to 30) was simulated in a commonly cited healthy soft tissue composition (Woodard and White, 1986) for 3 low energy sources where a fixed concentration (0.5% w/w) of each trace element was added. Three other tissue types (prostate, adipose and mammary gland) were also simulated with each of their trace components excluded alternately to quantify the contribution of each trace to the dose distribution. Finally, the dose differences between cancerous and healthy prostate tissue compositions were calculated, using more precise trace compositions(Kwiatek et al., 2005). All results were compared against a zero-trace tissue composition (HCNO only). All calculations were reported as dose to medium. (Table presented) Results: The presence of traces in a tissue produces a difference in the dose profile versus distance from the source that is dependent on Z, the trace concentration and the source type. Pd-103 was the most sensitive source to concentration change, while the EBS was the least. Low-Z traces (Na) had a negligible effect (<0.3%) in all tissues while higher Z (K) had a larger effect (>3%). There is a considerable difference in the dose profile between cancerous and healthy prostate (figure 1). (Figure presented) Conclusions: Trace elements have a non-negligible effect on the dose in tissues irradiated with low energy photon sources. This study underlines the need for further investigation into accurate determination of the trace composition of tissues associated with low energy brachytherapy. Alternatively, trace elements could be incorporated as a source of uncertainty in dose calculations.",,0

The relative biological effectiveness of two electronic brachytherapy sources was explored to determine if spectral differences due to source design influenced radiation quality and if radiation quality decreased with distance in the breast. The RBE was calculated through the number of DNA double strand breaks (RBEDSB) using the Monte Carlo damage simulator (MCDS) in combination with other Monte Carlo electron/photon spectrum calculations. 50kVp photons from the Intrabeam (Carl Zeiss Surgical) and Axxent (Xoft) through 40-mm spherical applicators were simulated to account for applicator and tissue attenuation in a variety of breast tissue compositions. 40kVp Axxent photons were also simulated. Secondary electrons (known to be responsible for most DNA damage) spectra at different distance were inputted into MCDS to calculate the RBEDSB. All RBEDSB used a cobalt-60 reference. RBEDSB data was combined with corresponding average photon spectrum energy for the Axxent and applied to model-based average photon energy distributions to produce an RBEDSB map of an accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) patient. Both Axxent and Intrabeam 50kVp spectra were shown to have a comparable RBEDSB of between 1.4 and 1.6 at all distances in spite of progressive beam hardening. The Axxent 40kVp also demonstrated a similar RBEDSB at distances. Most RBEDSB variability was dependent on the tissue type as was seen in rib (RBEDSB=1.4), gland (=1.55), adipose (=1.59), skin (=1.52) and lung (=1.50). RBEDSB variability between both sources was within 2%. A correlation was shown between RBEDSB and average photon energy and used to produce an RBEDSB map of a dose distribution in an APBI patient dataset. Radiation quality is very similar between electronic brachytherapy sources studied. No significant reductions in RBEDSB were observed with increasing distance from the source.",,0

Intraoperative detection of microscopic residual cancer in the tumor bed could be used to decrease the risk of a positive surgical margin, reduce rates of reexcision, and tailor adjuvant therapy. We used a protease-activated fluorescent imaging probe, LUM015, to detect cancer in vivo in a mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and ex vivo in a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial. In mice, intravenous injection of LUM015 labeled tumor cells, and residual fluorescence within the tumor bed predicted local recurrence. In 15 patients with STS or breast cancer, intravenous injection of LUM015 before surgery was well tolerated. Imaging of resected human tissues showed that fluorescence from tumor was significantly higher than fluorescence from normal tissues. LUM015 biodistribution, pharmacokinetic profiles, and metabolism were similar in mouse and human subjects. Tissue concentrations of LUM015 and its metabolites, including fluorescently labeled lysine, demonstrated that LUM015 is selectively distributed to tumors where it is activated by proteases. Experiments in mice with a constitutively active PEGylated fluorescent imaging probe support a model where tumor-selective probe distribution is a determinant of increased fluorescence in cancer. These co-clinical studies suggest that the tumor specificity of protease-activated imaging probes, such as LUM015, is dependent on both biodistribution and enzyme activity. Our first-in-human data support future clinical trials of LUM015 and other protease-sensitive probes.",eng,0

Between February 2003 and January 2009, 173 women with unifocal pathological Tis, T1, or T2 (up to 30 mm), N0 or N1 carcinomas of the breast were treated with post-lumpectomy brachytherapy to 34 Gy in 10 fractions over 5-10 days. We treated 137 patients with MammoSite single-lumen balloon brachytherapy, and 36 patients with multi-catheter brachytherapy. Patients with small and/or nonspherical lumpectomy cavities were usually treated with multi-catheter brachytherapy using 4-12 interstitial catheters. Median follow-up was 33 months. Three-year ipsilateral breast tumor control, disease-free, and overall survival rates for MammoSite brachytherapy were 100%, 100%, and 99%, respectively. Similar rates were obtained with multi-catheter brachytherapy. Minimum distances from the planning target volume for plan evaluation to a rib were 10 +/- 8 mm (mean +/- standard deviation) and 8 +/- 4 mm (mean +/- standard deviation) for MammoSite brachytherapy and multi-catheter brachytherapy, respectively (p = 0.48). Maximum rib doses were 101 +/- 14% (mean +/- standard deviation) and 74 +/- 10% (mean +/- standard deviation) of the prescribed dose for MammoSite brachytherapy and multi-catheter brachytherapy, respectively (p = 0.001). Multi-catheter brachytherapy results in more conformal radiation dose delivery and a significantly lower rib dose than MammoSite single-lumen brachytherapy. Long-term follow-up is needed to determine if the delivery of a lower radiation dose to the ribs will translate into a lower incidence of rib pain and fractures. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred eighty-two women with early stage breast carcinomas were treated with postlumpectomy brachytherapy using a Contura multilumen catheter (n=45) or a MammoSite single-lumen catheter (Cytyc Corp, Marlborough, MA) (n=137). Hypothetical MammoSite catheter treatment plans were created for the Contura patients. Treatment planning goals were to (1) avoid a radiation hot spot"" in the skin and (2) have only a small air/fluid pocket next to the balloon. RESULTS: The median followup was 16 months. Eighty-nine percent (40 of 45) of Contura plans satisfied both treatment planning goals vs. only 36% (16 of 45) of MammoSite plans (p<0.0001). A Contura catheter did not require explantation in 16% (7 of 45) of patients where balloon-to-skin spacing was only 3-6mm and 11% (5 of 45) of patients where there was an air/fluid pocket >10% of the planning target volume for plan evaluation (PTV_EVAL). A MammoSite catheter was explanted in 10% of cases where the minimum balloon-to-skin distance was <7mm and in 13% of cases where there was a large air/fluid pocket next to the balloon. Our incidence rates of acute toxicity with a Contura catheter were similar to those with a MammoSite catheter. CONCLUSIONS: A Contura catheter provides important dosimetric advantages over a MammoSite catheter and does not require explantation in cases where balloon-to-skin spacing is only 3-6mm or an air/fluid pocket next to the balloon is >10% of PTV_EVAL.""",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: APBI was used to treat 2127 cases of early-stage breast cancer (WBH, n=678; ASBrS, n=1449). Three forms of APBI were used at WBH (interstitial, n=221; balloon-based, n=255; or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, n=206), whereas all Registry Trial patients received balloon-based brachytherapy. Patients were divided according to the ASTRO CS into suitable (n=661, 36.5%), cautionary (n=850, 46.9%), and unsuitable (n=302, 16.7%) categories. Tumor characteristics and clinical outcomes were analyzed according to CS group. RESULTS: The median age was 65 years (range, 32-94 years), and the median tumor size was 10.0 mm (range, 0-45 mm). The median follow-up time was 60.6 months. The WBH cohort had more node-positive disease (6.9% vs 2.6%, P<.01) and cautionary patients (49.5% vs 41.8%, P=.06). The 5-year actuarial ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), regional nodal failure (RNF), and distant metastasis (DM) for the whole cohort were 2.8%, 0.6%, 1.6%. The rate of IBTR was not statistically higher between suitable (2.5%), cautionary (3.3%), or unsuitable (4.6%) patients (P=.20). The nonsignificant increase in IBTR for the cautionary and unsuitable categories was due to increased elsewhere failures and new primaries (P=.04), not tumor bed recurrence (P=.93). CONCLUSIONS: Excellent outcomes after breast-conserving surgery and APBI were seen in our pooled analysis. The current ASTRO CS guidelines did not adequately differentiate patients at an increased risk of IBTR or tumor bed failure in this large patient cohort.",eng,0

This is performed by different techniques including intraoperative electron beam techniques and high-dose rate brachytherapy. IORT is usually given in combination with external-beam radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy and surgical resection. IORT excludes part or all dose-limiting sensitive structures, thereby increasing the effective dose to the tumor bed (and therefore local control) without significantly increasing normal tissue morbidity. Despite best contemporary therapy, high rates of local failure occur in patients with locally advanced or recurrent rectal cancer, retroperitoneal sarcoma, select gynecologic cancers, and other malignancies. The addition of IORT to conventional treatment methods has improved local control as well as survival in many disease sites in both the primary and locally recurrent disease settings. More recently, there has been interest in the use of IORT as a technique of partial breast irradiation for women with early breast cancer. Given newer and lower cost treatment devices, the use of IORT in clinical practice will likely grow, with increasing integration into the treatment of nonconventional malignancies. Optimally, phase III randomized trials will be carried out to prove its efficacy in these disease sites. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,0

There was a non-significant 45% increase in the odds of having an outcome of EG for patients in the TARGIT group relative to the EBRT group (OR=1.45, 95%CI 0.78 - 2.69, p=0.245) after adjusting for tumour size. The results were similar when adjusted for tumour grade and age of the patient. For year 1 only there was a statistically significant 2.35 fold increase in the odds of having an outcome of EG for patients in the TARGIT group relative to the EBRT group (OR=2.35, 95%CI 1.02 - 5.45, p=0.047) after adjusting for age of the patient, tumour size and grade. Conclusions: These results confirm a significantly better cosmetic outcome with TARGIT compared to EBRT in the first year after surgery.",,0

The majority of women with early breast cancer are given whole breast external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after lumpectomy (breast conservation). It has been demonstrated, using an objective assessment of aesthetic outcome in patients from a randomised trial, that redness"", a surrogate for radiation induced erythema grade I or II, is significantly greater after one year in patients receiving EBRT compared with those receiving intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) using TARGIT. However, it has been observed that not all women given EBRT have detectable erythema, which implies that there is a greater variability in this group. In order to test this hypothesis a test of unequal group variances was performed. Methods: 991 frontal digital photographs were analysed from women participating in the TARGIT A Trial (NCT00983684 ) at four sites (Lublin, Mannheim, Copenhagen and Perth). Photographs taken at baseline (before surgery), 1 and 2 years (after surgery and EBRT or IORT) were objectively assessed, blinded to treatment received, by BCCT.core software which produces overall Harris scores, and scores for various measures of symmetry, colour and scar. The scores for colour were analysed in SAS v9.4 using PROC GLM. Results: cEMDL, a colour score associated with ""lightness"", showed significant heterogeneity of variance (using Levene's and Welch's Tests, p < 0.0001) in the women treated with EBRT, but not in those treated with IORT (p = 0.4). However, cX2b (associated with ""redness"") showed significant heterogeneity of variance in both the EBRT and IORT treated groups (p < 0.0001), although the point estimates moved in different directions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that there are complex changes in skin colour following radiotherapy to the breast, provides further evidence that objective scoring using BCCT.core is a useful approach, and confirms the early beneficial effect of TARGIT on aesthetic outcome.""",,0

The main outcome measure is risk of local relapse within the treated breast. We report here the one-year data from a subeta-protocol assessing cosmesis in a subeta-set of 118 women over 50 years old participating in the TARGIT Trial from one centre (Perth, Australia). Materials and Methods: Frontal digital photographs from 118 patients (60 IORT, 58 EBRT) taken at baseline and one year after completion of breast conserving surgery were assessed blinded to randomised treatment using specialist software (BCCT.core 2.0, INESC Porto, Portugal) which produces a composite score (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor) based on symmetry, colour and scar. Statistical advice on logistic regression using Stata (StataCorp, USA) was given by the Biostatistics Group, The Joint UCL, UCLH, & Royal Free Biomedical Research Unit. Results: Median age at randomisation was 61 (IQR 56-67) years; photographs were taken before and after surgery (median 11 months, IQR 11-12); all patients were free from recurrence. The composite scores were combined into Excellent/Good and Fair/Poor, see Table 1. 77% (46/60) of patients randomised to IORT had Excellent/Good cosmetic outcome at one year, compared with 60% (35/58) randomised to EBRT. The odds of Excellent/Good outcome at one year, adjusted for the baseline composite score, was significantly higher in the IORT group compared to EBRT, adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.38 (95% CI 1.04-5.43), p =0.039. Conclusions: These results indicate that the cosmetic effects of targeted radiotherapy using Intrabeam are significantly improved compared to those obtained with conventional EBRT, one year after surgery.

This article reviews twelve reasons for the use of the technique, with a particular emphasis on targeted intra-operative radiotherapy (TARGIT) which uses X-rays generated from a portable device within the operating theatre immediately after the breast tumour (and surrounding margin of healthy tissue) has been removed. The delivery of a single fraction of radiotherapy directly to the tumour bed at the time of surgery, with the capability of adding EBRT at a later date if required (risk-adaptive technique) is discussed in light of recent results from a large multinational randomised controlled trial comparing TARGIT with EBRT. The technique avoids irradiation of normal tissues such as skin, heart, lungs, ribs and spine, and has been shown to improve cosmetic outcome when compared with EBRT. Beneficial aspects to both institutional and societal economics are discussed, together with evidence demonstrating excellent patient satisfaction and quality of life. There is a discussion of the published evidence regarding the use of IORT twice in the same breast (for new primary cancers) and in patients who would never be considered for EBRT because of their special circumstances (such as the frail, the elderly, or those with collagen vascular disease). Finally, there is a discussion of the role of the TARGIT Academy in developing and sustaining high standards in the use of the technique.",eng,0

The aim of this study was to determine if the single high dose of TARGIT is associated with impaired cosmesis within the first year after surgery. Materials/Methods: EBRT was given as 2 Gy per fraction over 23 or 28 fractions, without a boost. IORT was given as 20 Gy at the surface of the applicator for between 26 and 52 minutes (depending on applicator size). Frontal digital photographs were taken of women participating in the TARGIT Trial at a single center and analyzed, blinded to treatment received, by BCCT.core software which produced Harris scores, and individual scores for symmetry, color, and scar (LBC, cX2b and sEMDb). Results: Seventeen women (9 EBRT, 8 IORT) of median age 65 years (range 50 to 79) had photographs taken at baseline (no more than 5 days prior to surgery), and at one month (median 31 d), at 6m if given EBRT (median 87 d from start), and at one year (median 332 d).

At 6m there was a significant change from baseline in cX2b in the women given EBRT (P = 0.0247 by paired t-test, see Table); this change persisted to one year. No change was seen after IORT. There were no significant differences in LBC or sEMDb. Conclusions: This objective assessment of aesthetic outcome in patients from a randomized trial demonstrates that ""redness"" is significantly worse within 90 d of commencement of EBRT; this change was not seen in women treated with IORT. This study provides further evidence that the objective scoring of cosmesis from photographs using BCCT.core is feasible and may be an approach for standardization, and shows an early beneficial effect of TARGIT on cosmesis.

Suzanne Klimberg,2012.0,Long-term results of excision followed by radiofrequency ablation as the sole means of local therapy for breast cancer,10.1245/s10434-012-2476-2,"INTRODUCTION: Clinical trials have yet to find a size or grade of invasive cancer which can be treated with lumpectomy alone due to the higher local recurrence (LR) rate without radiation (XRT). Excision followed by radiofrequency ablation (eRFA) is an intraoperative method which utilizes heat to create an additional tumor-free zone around the lumpectomy cavity. We hypothesized that eRFA after lumpectomy for invasive breast cancer could reduce the need for re-excision in close margins and potentially maintain local control without the need for XRT. METHODS: This institutional review board-approved study from July 2002 to December 2010 involved patients undergoing eRFA. A standard lumpectomy was performed and then the RFA probe was deployed 1 cm circumferentially into the walls of the lumpectomy cavity and maintained at 100 degrees C for 15 min. Validated doppler sonography was used to determine final ablation size. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients (mean age of 68.8 +/- 10.9 years) with invasive cancer who had an average tumor size of 1.0 +/- 0.54 cm (range of 0.2-2.6 cm) underwent eRFA. Margins were negative in 54, close in 10, focally positive in 6, and grossly positive in 3 patients. Sixteen out of 19 (84 %) of patients with close or positive margins were spared of re-excision. Median follow-up was 55 +/- 21 months. Only one patient (1.3 %) developed an in site recurrence. There were three recurrences, elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up suggests that eRFA may reduce the need for re- excision as well as reduce LR for invasive breast cancer treated without XRT.",eng,0

This study determined the feasibility of this new technique using SPIOs and a handheld magnetometer to detect SLNs in prostate cancer (PC). METHODS: Enrolled 20 patients with intermediate and high-risk PC (PSA >10 and/or Gleason score >7) in a prospective study (12/2013-1/2014; DRKS00005473), following an ethics committee approval. After transrectal intraprostatic SPIOs injection a day earlier, patients (19/20) underwent magnetometer-guided sentinel lymphadenectomy (sPLND) and extended PLND, followed by radical prostatectomy. One patient was not operated because of an unrelated coagulation disorder. The ex vivo magnetic activity of all lymph nodes (LNs) removed was measured. The detection rate, rate of in vivo detected SLNs, and sensitivity of sPLND was established. RESULTS: No adverse events attributable to SPIOs injection were observed. Identified 126 SLNs (median 7, IQR 4-9) and resected 334 LNs (median 17, IQR 14-19); 37 % (7/19) of the patients had LN metastases (median 1, IQR 1-3.5). The detection rate and rate of in vivo detected SLNs were 90 % (17/19) and 94 % (118/126) respectively. Using sPLND, all LN metastases were detected (15/15, sensitivity 100 %) in all patients identified with SLNs. One LN + patient showed no SLNs following transurethral prostate resection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study using a magnetic tracer and magnetometer to detect SLNs in PC. Initial data indicate that this simple, radiation-free procedure is safe, feasible, and reliably identifies SLN and LN metastases in most patients.",eng,0

Materials and Methods: Between October 2010 and September 2011, a total of 154 early-stage breast cancers in 151 women were irradiated with IORT using 6-12 MeV electrons (10 Gy) followed by whole-breast EBRT (50.4 Gy). Patients were prospectively followed according to institutional standards for side effects (CTC-criteria) with regular clinical examination, photo-documentation and sonograpy when indicated. These data were retrospectively compared to a group of 150 patients with 153 breast cancers treated between January 2010 and September 2010 with 50.4 Gy WBI followed by an additional EBRT-boost of 16 Gy. When indicated, adjuvant chemotherapy was given after BCS (+IORT) but before EBRT of the whole breast Results: Median follow-up was 8 months [range: 2-14 months]. Both groups were comparable with respect to median age (IORT-group: 60 years; range: 33-87 years, EBRT-group: 60.3 years, range: 38-86 years) and median tumor size (16.4 vs. 16.9 mm). In the IORT-group slightly more patients (28%) received adjuvant chemotherapy as compared to the EBRT-Group (24%). Secondary resections due to positive resection margins was necessary in 15.7% of patients in the EBRT-group but only in 9.7% in the IORT-group. Cutaneous side effects were significantly reduced (p: 0.0466) in the group of patients receiving IORT as compared to the group receiving the EBRT boost. Whereas mastitis (0.7% vs. 2%) and seroma needing at least one aspiration (7.8% vs. 9.2%) occurred slightly less frequent in the IORT-group, fat tissue necrosis was more common in the IORT-group (7.9% vs. 3.9%, p: 0.1706). We did not observe any difference in the frequency of hematoma (1.3%) and local infections (3.2% vs. 3.9%). Conclusions: Tumor bed boost using IORT in women with early breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery and WBI was feasible. The incidence of acute side effects was scarce; most patients tolerated the IORT very well. Of importance, impaired healing was not more frequent after IORT. The study shows the potential advantage of IORT in reducing cutaneous side effects of adjuvant radiotherapy after BCS.",,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 692 patients were treated with APBI at a single institution between April 1993 and January 2012 using interstitial (n=195), balloon (n=292), and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (n=205) techniques. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by risk group and number of RFs. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 0-18.3 years). Most patients were classified as suitable (n=240, 34%) or cautionary (n=343, 50%) risk, whereas 16% (n=109) were unsuitable. In patients with increasing total RFs (1 RF, 2 RF, 3+ RF), higher rates of grade 3 histology (10% vs 18% vs 32%, P<.001), estrogen receptor negativity (0 vs 12% vs 29%, P<.001), close/positive margins (0 vs 6% vs 17%, P<.001), and use of adjuvant chemotherapy (3% vs 12% vs 33%, P<.001) were noted. When pooling cautionary and unsuitable patients, increased ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence/regional recurrence was most notable for patients with 3 or more combined RFs versus 2 or fewer combined RFs (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 3 or more cautionary or unsuitable RFs may be at risk for higher local, regional, and distant recurrence after breast-conserving therapy using APBI. Patients with 2 or fewer total RFs have 98% locoregional control at 5 years. Inclusion of total number of RFs in future risk stratification schemes for APBI may be warranted.",eng,0

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 2000 breasts (1990 women) were treated with APBI at William Beaumont Hospital (n=551) or on the American Society of Breast Surgeons MammoSite Registry Trial (n=1449). Techniques included multiplanar interstitial catheters (n=98), balloon-based brachytherapy (n=1689), and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (n=213). Clinicopathologic variables were gathered prospectively. A nomogram was formulated utilizing the Cox proportional hazards regression model to predict for LRR. This was validated by generating a bias-corrected index and cross-validated with a concordance index. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 5.5 years (range, 0.9-18.3 years). Of the 2000 cases, 435 were excluded because of missing data. Univariate analysis found that age <50 years, pre-/perimenopausal status, close/positive margins, estrogen receptor negativity, and high grade were associated with a higher frequency of LRR. These 5 independent covariates were used to create adjusted estimates, weighting each on a scale of 0-100. The total score is identified on a points scale to obtain the probability of an LRR over the study period. The model demonstrated good concordance for predicting LRR, with a concordance index of 0.641. CONCLUSIONS: The formulation of a practical, easy-to-use nomogram for calculating the risk of LRR in patients undergoing APBI will help guide the appropriate selection of patients for off-protocol utilization of APBI.",eng,0

The purpose of this analysis is to present long-term clinical outcomes between WBI and APBI. METHODS: A total of 3009 patients were treated with breast conserving therapy at a single institution between 1980 and 2012. Among them, 2528 patients received WBI and 481 received APBI (interstitial or balloon based). A matched-pair analysis was performed with patients matched by age (+/-3 years), stage (T-stage vs. T1 vs. T2), and estrogen receptor status (+/-). All patients had a minimum of 12 months follow-up. A total of 274 matches (ratio 1:1) were made. RESULTS: No differences between groups were noted with respect to clinicopathologic features; WBI patients demonstrated a trend for slightly larger tumors (1.3 vs. 1.1 cm, P=0.06). At 10 years, no differences were noted with respect to rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (4% vs. 4%, P=0.11), regional recurrence (1% vs. 1%, P=0.20), contralateral breast failure (9% vs. 3%, P=0.06), or distant metastases (3% vs. 6%, P=0.47) for WBI and APBI, respectively. In addition, 10-year disease-free survival (93% vs. 91%, P=0.10) and overall survival (83% vs. 75%, P=0.34) were similar.

Chen,2015.0,Comparison of chronic toxicities between brachytherapy-based accelerated partial breast irradiation and whole breast irradiation using intensity modulated radiotherapy,10.1016/j.breast.2015.09.004,"PURPOSE: Brachytherapy-based APBI (bAPBI) shortens treatment duration and limits dose to normal tissue. While studies have demonstrated similar local control when comparing bAPBI and whole breast irradiation using intensity modulated radiotherapy (WBI-IMRT), comparison of late side effects is limited. Here, we report chronic toxicity profiles associated with these two treatment modalities. METHODS: 1034 patients with early stage breast cancer were treated at a single institution; 489 received standard-fractionation WBI-IMRT between 2000 and 2013 and 545 received bAPBI (interstitial 40%, applicator-based 60%) between 1993 and 2013. Chronic toxicity was evaluated >/=6 months utilizing CTCAE version 3.0; cosmesis was evaluated using the Harvard scale. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 4.6 years (range 0.1-13.4) for WBI-IMRT versus 6.7 years (range 0.1-20.1) for bAPBI (p < 0.001). Compared to WBI-IMRT, bAPBI was associated with higher rates of >/=grade 2 seroma formation (14.4% vs 2.9%, p < 0.001), telangiectasia (12.3% vs 2.1%, p = 0.002) and symptomatic fat necrosis (10.2% vs 3.6%, p < 0.001). Lower rates of hyperpigmentation were observed (5.8% vs 14.5%; p = 0.001). Infection rates were similar (3.3% vs 1.3%, p = 0.07). There was no difference between rates of fair (6.1% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.30) or poor (0.2% vs. 0.5%, p = NS) cosmesis. Mastectomy rates for local recurrence (3.1% for WBI-IMRT and 1.2% for bAPBI, p = 0.06), or for other reasons (0.8% and 0.6%, p = 0.60) were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: With 5-year follow-up, WBI-IMRT and bAPBI are associated with similar, acceptable rates of toxicity. These data further support the utilization of bAPBI as a modality to deliver adjuvant radiation in a safe and efficacious manner.",eng,0

Tinger,2007.0,On-Board Imager-based MammoSite treatment verification,10.1007/s11517-007-0202-1,"Contemporary radiation oncology departments are often lacking a conventional simulator due to common use of virtual simulation and recent implementation of image guided radiation therapy. A protocol based on MammoSite method was developed using CT based planning, a Source Position Simulator (SPS) with a Simulator Wire and a linear accelerator based On-Board Imager (OBI) for daily verification. After MammoSite balloon implantation, the patient undergoes a CT study. The images are evaluated for tissue conformance, balloon symmetry, and balloon surface to skin distance according to the departmental procedure. Prior to the CT study the SPS is attached to the transfer tube that in turn is attached to the balloon catheter. The length from the indexer to the first dwell position is measured using the simulator wire with X-ray markers. After the CT study is performed, the data set is sent to the Varian Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS) and to the Nucletron PLATO brachytherapy planning system. The reference digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) of anterior and lateral setup fields are created using Eclipse TPS and are immediately available on the OBI console via the Varian Vision integrated system. The source dwell position coinciding with the balloon center is identified in the CT dataset, followed by the offset calculation, catheter reconstruction, dose points placement and dwell time calculation. OBI fluoroscopy images are acquired and marked as initial. Prior to each treatment fraction balloon diameter and symmetry are evaluated using OBI fluoroscopy and tools available on the OBI console. Acquired images are compared with reference DRRs and/or initial OBI images. The whole process from initial evaluation to daily verification is filmless and does not undermine the precision of the procedure. This verification time does not exceed 10 min. The balloon diameter correlates well (within 1 mm) between initial CT and OBI verification images. The balloon symmetry is defined with 1 mm accuracy using existing OBI console tools. It is feasible to use OBI based simulation for the MammoSite balloon placement evaluation, balloon integrity daily verification, and treatment dwell position coincidence with balloon center. This verification is a rapid process and is an alternative to the conventional simulator based technique. The simulator wire with X-ray markers for the SPS is the recommended tool for the CT based MammoSite procedure.",eng,0

The present paper focuses on the treatment planning, dosimetry, and quality assurance aspects of that treatment, based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0413 randomized prospective trial (RTOG 0413) protocol. We investigate the usefulness of evaluating implants for treatment appropriateness according to the full set of RTOG criteria as compared with the manufacturer's guidelines. We describe our methods to improve MammoSite balloon implants that would otherwise not comply with the protocol. The initially acquired computed tomography (CT) images are evaluated for tissue conformance, balloon surface-to-skin distance, and balloon symmetry. If the implant fails to meet the foregoing criteria, corrective action such as delay in the CT scan, balloon manipulation, or fluid volume adjustment is taken, and the patient is re-scanned. If the corrective action appears to be successful, three dimensional treatment planning and dose-volume histogram analysis is performed to evaluate the geometric and dosimetric parameters with regard to the RTOG 0413 protocol. The evaluated parameters include, volume ratio of the lumpectomy cavity to the ipsilateral breast, target volume coverage, tissue-balloon conformance, balloon symmetry, minimal balloon surface-to-skin distance, maximum skin dose, and normal breast tissue dose-volume parameters V150 and V200. Among our implants, 21.7% did not initially meet the RTOG 0413 acceptance criteria. Asymmetry and poor conformance values reduce the target volume coverage, and so an implant with moderate conformance and asymmetry can be within the manufacturer's guidelines, but still not meet the RTOG criteria. Our intervention corrected all but one of the implants that failed to meet the criteria. Manipulating the cavity and adjusting the balloon volume may salvage an implant and meet the strict geometric and dosimetric criteria imposed by the RTOG 0413 protocol.",,0

We performed a retrospective study to inform our current practice in anaesthesia procedures for radiotherapy application in children, brachytherapy and intraoperative radiation. The records of anaesthetized radiotherapy patients between January 2000 and September 2005 were analyzed. We analysed demographic data, type and localisation of neoplasm, radiotherapy data, type of anaesthesia and anaesthesia - related complications. In order to provide safe and efficient anaesthesia outside the Department of Anaesthesiology, we designed a mobile anaesthesia workstation. In total we performed 739 anaesthesia procedures: 267 in 16 children, 321 in 284 brachytherapy patients, and 151 as a part of intraoperative radiotherapy. Children age ranged from 2 - 8 years (median 4.6). All were given midazolam and atropine, then thiopental or ketamine. Neither muscle relaxants, nor propofol were used. Brachytherapy patients underwent: spinal block in 190 cases, general anaesthesia in 115, and deep sedation in 16 cases. General anaesthesia was inducted by propofol, followed by etomidate, thiopental and fentanyl. For spinal block the patients were given hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl. Deep sedation was performed with midazolam and fentanyl, and thiopental or propofol when needed. Intraoperative radiotherapy was applied immediately after breast conserving surgery. No serious complications in all 739 anaesthesia procedures occurred. In conclusion we demonstrated the feasibility and safety of anaesthesia applied in our radiotherapy patients. The custom designed mobile anaesthesia workstation allowed us to provide safe and efficient anaesthesia in any place outside the Department of Anaesthesiology.",,0

Intraoperative radiotherapy enables delivery of single fraction radiotherapy in the operating room immediately after surgical resection of the primary tumour. It requires general anaesthesia without direct presence of the anaesthetic team in the operating room. Methods. We have compared cardiovascular stabilily, level of anaesthesia, time of absence of an anaesthesiologist in the operating room and cost of anaesthesia in 82 adult women undergoing targeted intraoperative radiotherapy. Patients were randomly divided to receive propofol/remifentanil (25) propofol/fentanyl (22), thiopentone/fentanyl/ sevoflurane (29) and etomidate/fentanyl/sevoflurane anaesthesia (6). The Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were used for statistical analysis. Results. The clinically assessed level of anaesthesia, arterial blood pressure and heart rates were similar in all groups. The cost of anaesthesia was lower in the thiopentone and etomidate groups. Discussion and conclusion. As it has been described, the choice of the method of anaesthesia does not play an important role in intraoperative radiotherapy. Special attention should be paid to the adequacy of the monitoring system, and to vigilance during the absence of the anaesthetic team from the therapy suite. © PTAiIT, Borgis.",,0

Half of the women considered suitable for local excision of the breast cancer followed by radiotherapy (conservation) elected to have mastectomy, and intraoperative findings dictated mastectomy in about 20% of those electing conservation.

Journal Article,W. H. Wolberg; M. A. Tanner; E. P. Romsaas; D. L. Trump; J. F. Malec,1987.0,Factors influencing options in primary breast cancer treatment,", ","Primary breast cancer treatment is determined by tumor factors and by patient preference. Breast cancer treatments that preserve the cosmetic appearance of the breast are appealing and effective for appropriately selected patients; long-term survival following tumor excision and breast irradiation appears to be comparable to that for mastectomy. Since April 1981, when a protocol was developed and treatment options were offered, factors influencing treatment selection have been analyzed in 206 consecutive primary breast cancer patients. Mastectomy was dictated by tumor-related factors in 96 patients (47%); 110 patients (53%) had the option of mastectomy or conservation--tumor excision plus radiotherapy to the breast. Among these 110 eligible patients, 54 chose conservation (49%) and 56 chose mastectomy (51%). Intraoperative findings for ten patients electing conservation necessitated mastectomy, so conservation was accomplished for 44 (21%) of those treated for breast cancer. Beginning in July 1982, breast cancer patients took a battery of psychosexual assessments before any operation (Profile of Mood States [POMS], Health Locus of Control Scale [HLCS] Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test [MAT], Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale [PAIS], Derogatis Sexual Function Inventory [DSFI], Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory [MCMI], and a Breast Cancer Information Test [BCIT]). Comparisons of psychologic and demographic variables were made between patients who chose mastectomy and those who chose conservation. No demographic variable was statistically significantly related to choice, although older women tended to select mastectomy more than younger women. Compared with those who elected conservation, women who elected mastectomy were more tense and anxious (P less than .01), more introverted (P less than .01), felt more depressed and dejected (P less than .05), and reported more sexual problems (P less than .05). Those who elected conservation valued their physical appearance more highly (P less than .01) and were generally more self-interested (P less than .05). Mastectomy was dictated by medical considerations for approximately half of patients with breast cancer. Among candidates for breast conservation, the importance of retaining the breast appeared to be determined to a significant degree by measurable psychological factors.",eng,0

We conducted a phase II study for patients with T1/T2 N0 breast cancers in which a single fraction of IOERT was used as the boost, thus shortening the treatment duration by 1-2 weeks. Materials/Methods: Patients underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. If the surgical margin and lymph nodes were free of disease by frozen section, 10 Gy of IOERT using 6-12 MeV electrons was delivered to the tumor bed by a dedicated mobile linear accelerator in the operating room. After adequate wound healing, 48 Gy EBRT was given to the whole breast in 24 fractions. Results: Fifty-two patients (pts) were enrolled between 2/2003 and 1/2005. The median age was 68. There were 44 T1 and 8 T2 tumors. Adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy was given to 11 and 27 patients, respectively.

Two of these pts required incision and drainage.A cost analysis showed a mean savings of > 1524/case in the cost of treatment compared to standard external electron beam boost. Conclusions: Our study shows that 10 Gy of IOERT can be used as the tumor bed boost in lieu of 6-8 days of standard electron beam treatment with excellent local control of disease at 5 years, allowing a shortened treatment time and lower cost. Late complications included fat necrosis in 10% of patients and 8% late infections.

A retrospective review was conducted 195 procedures in which mastectomy and SLNB were performed in a single stage with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) over a 10-year period. Long-term outcomes were analyzed within the context of patient characteristics and SLNB results. Intraoperative SLNB analysis was found to be a reliable method for planning IBR, as there were no patients noted to have untoward sequelae as a result of a false-negative SLNB, and the probability of postmastectomy radiation therapy was predictable based on the intraoperative SLNB results. We advocate that SLNB be performed in a single stage with mastectomy and IBR.",eng,0

A recent phase III trial has shown the non-inferiority of intraoperative radiotherapy compared with external beam radiotherapy (Vaidya J et al. Lancet 2010) with a reduction in radiotherapy toxicity in the intraoperative radiotherapy group (0.5% vs 2.1%; p = 0.002). Intraoperative radiotherapy also has advantages in cost saving and patient convenience, particularly for those living some distance from a cancer centre. There are data to suggest an increase in morbidity and mortality from stroke and heart disease in those exposed to radiation and this includes late effects from breast radiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy uses low energy x-rays (50 KV) and is therefore likely to reduce the radiation exposure of the cardiovascular system compared with external beam radiotherapy. We are using -H2AX foci formation in peripheral blood lymphocytes as a surrogate marker of radiation dose to the heart and great vessels. The phosphorylated histone H2AX protein (-H2AX) is a very sensitive assay for the induction of double strand breaks caused by ionising radiation, which will be created as the lymphocytes pass through, and adjacent to, the irradiated field.

A recent phase 3 trial has shown the non-inferiority of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) compared with EBRT in terms of short-term safety and efficacy (TARGIT A Trial; Lancet 2010). IORT also has advantages in cost saving and patient convenience. Radiation exposure of the heart and cardiac vessels is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality following EBRT for breast cancer and has been shown to increase the rate of major coronary events by 7.4% per gray of exposure to the heart (Darby; NEJM 2013). IORT uses low energy x-rays (50 kV) and is likely to reduce the radiation exposure of the cardiovascular system compared with EBRT. We have used gamma-H2AX foci formation in peripheral blood lymphocytes as a surrogate marker of radiation dose to the heart and great vessels. The phosphorylated histone H2AX protein (gamma-H2AX) is expressed after induction of DNA double strand breaks caused by ionising radiation, created as the lymphocytes pass through and adjacent to the irradiated field. Methods 34 patients were recruited, having either EBRT or IORT as part of a randomised controlled trial. The main inclusion criteria were adult females with early breast cancer suitable for breast conserving surgery and the main exclusion criteria were previous malignancy, recent exposure to radiation (excluding CT planning scan) and prior chemotherapy. Blood samples were taken immediately prior to and 30 minutes after either first fraction of EBRT or after IORT treatment, and then rapidly processed to allow quantification of the gamma-H2AX biomarker in lymphocytes (Rothkamm; Radiology 2007). This study had approval from the Local Research and Ethics Committee. Results Data were available for 31 patients. Means and standard deviations for the change in gamma-H2AX foci number per cell for each group are summarised in table 1. Following IORT there was an increase of 0.203 foci per cell (range -1.436 to 1.275) compared with an increase of 0.935 foci per cell (range -0.679 to 2.216) in the EBRT group; this difference was highly significant (p = 0.009). Conclusions These data show a significantly greater change in gamma-H2AX foci number per cell following one fraction of EBRT compared to IORT. IORT is a single treatment (20Gy at the applicator surface) whereas EBRT is repeated 15 times (2.67Gy x 15 fractions) multiplying the effect on the patients' cardiovascular system. It may be hypothesised that this reduced radiotherapy dose from IORT will reduce the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared to EBRT. This is the first study to demonstrate the real time effect of radiotherapy to the heart and great vessels using a biomarker and demonstrates a proof of concept methodology for similar applications.",,0

Correlation in the EBRT group between heart dose in gray and change in mean gamma-H2AX foci number per cell showed a correlation coefficient of -0.154 (p = 0.542). Using previously estimated doses to the heart from IORT (0.01 Gy) correlation coefficient for all patients was 0.375 (p = 0.037). Conclusions: Biological dosimetry with the gamma-H2AX biomarker is useful to differentiate large dose differences such as between EBRT and IORT and suggests a higher cardiac dose from EBRT. However this study did not demonstrate a correlation between planned dose to the heart and change in the gamma-H2AX foci within EBRT patients. One possible reason for this is that the increase in gamma-H2AX foci number detected is due to an increased whole body radiation dose rather than a greater volume of blood from the heart being within the radiation field.",,0

Keshtgar,2014.0,Biological dosimetry for breast cancer radiotherapy: a comparison of external beam and intraoperative radiotherapy,10.1186/2193-1801-3-329,"PURPOSE: External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is the gold standard adjuvant treatment after breast conserving surgery although a recent phase 3 trial has shown the non-inferiority of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT). Radiation exposure of the heart and cardiac vessels causes an increase in morbidity and mortality following EBRT for breast cancer. We have used gamma-H2AX foci formation in peripheral blood lymphocytes as a surrogate marker of dose delivered to the heart and great vessels and have assessed the feasibility of using this technique for biological dosimetry. METHODS: 34 patients were recruited, having either EBRT or IORT as part of a randomised controlled trial (TARGIT). Blood samples were taken prior to and after first fraction of radiotherapy, and the gamma-H2AX biomarker then quantified. RESULTS: Data were available for 31 patients. Following TARGIT-IORT there was an increase of 0.203 foci per cell (range -1.436 to 1.275) compared with 0.935 foci per cell (range -0.679 to 2.216) in the EBRT group; this difference was highly significant (p = 0.009). As TARGIT-IORT treatment is completed with a single fraction, whilst EBRT requires at least 15 fractions, the actual difference is estimated to be many times more. CONCLUSIONS: These data show a significantly greater change in gamma-H2AX foci number per cell following one fraction of EBRT compared to TARGIT-IORT. This is the first study to demonstrate this effect using a biomarker and demonstrates a proof of concept methodology for similar applications.",eng,1

Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) with low energy photons as boost is currently evaluated. Data on normal tissue toxicity and local relapse rates are presented. Materials/Methods: Between December 2008 and January 2012, 546 pts. with invasive breast cancer received an intraoperative boost with 50 kV photons immediately after surgical excision. Surgery was performed at two community breast cancer centers (K.F., O.K., C.U.). All pathology specimens were centrally examined (A.N.). The radiation dose was 20 Gy at the surface of the applicator, and 5 to 7 Gy at 1cm surrounding tissue. After completion of breast conserving surgery, patients received external beam irradiation (EBRT) of mean 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions over 5 weeks starting 5 to 7 weeks after surgery or 2 to 3 weeks after end of chemotherapy. Endocrine and chemotherapy was given according to St. Gallen and AGO (national German) guidelines. In EBRT, a field-in-field technique was applied avoiding wedges. Data were collected prospectively. Kaplan-Meier survival plots were created. Normal tissue toxicity was scored by the treating radiation oncologists (F.W., C.G., C.D., C.P.) according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 3.0 (CTCAE 2003). Results: Invasive ductal carcinomas comprised 87.5%, lobular cancer 5.8%, and 6.7% of various other types. No DCIS were included. The mean tumor size was 14mm (range: 2mm to 35 mm).Triple negative histology was found in 51/546 (9%), G3 tumors in 104/546 (19%), and node positive cancer in 81/546 (14.8%). Twenty patients (3.6%) were < 40 years. Secondary mastectomies due to final pathology report (risk factors of multicentricity or EIC) had to be performed in 5 pts. (0.9%). After a mean follow up of 18 months (2 to 38,8 months) grade 3/4 side effects occurred in 5/546 (0,9%). Two patients developed serious infections 3 and 12 months after IORT with severe pain (grade 4) necessitating secondary mastectomies. One local recurrence occurred 12 months after treatment (actuarial local relapse rate 0.3%). The overall survival rate is 100%. Preliminary results of an ongoing quality-of-live evaluation in a subset of pts. shows very high rates of satisfaction with the procedure. Conclusions: IORT boost is a safe and well-tolerated technique with very low risk of serious side effects. Follow up is short but the local relapse rates seem to be very low.",,0

The quality of a radiation can be determined by the microscopic distribution of energy transfers along and across the charged particle tracks. The lineal energy, y, serves as an accurate measure of local energy concentration. The dose mean lineal energy, yD, is an indicator of radiation quality. For low linear energy transfer radiation, the ratio of its dose mean lineal energy to that of (60)Co gamma rays can serve as a good indicator of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) at low doses. In this study, microdosimetric simulations are performed for soft tissue irradiated by 50 kV X rays generated from the IORT device, with a 4-cm breast applicator attached. All energy transfers are recorded with the location coordinates in the tissue. Microdosimetric single events in a sphere of 1 micro m in diameter are scored as a function of radial distances from the applicator surface. Single-event spectra are then constructed. From those single-event spectra, dose mean lineal energy is calculated. Compared with dose mean lineal energy of (60)Co gamma rays, the estimated RBEs at low doses are given for the X rays at different depths in the tissue. The RBEs at clinically relevant doses, as a function of depth, are also presented. Copyright © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Journal Article,S. Xu; J. Lu; O. Zhou; Y. Chen,2015.0,Statistical iterative reconstruction to improve image quality for digital breast tomosynthesis,10.1118/1.4928603,"PURPOSE: Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a novel modality with the potential to improve early detection of breast cancer by providing three-dimensional (3D) imaging with a low radiation dose. 3D image reconstruction presents some challenges: cone-beam and flat-panel geometry, and highly incomplete sampling. A promising means of overcome these challenges is statistical iterative reconstruction (IR), since it provides the flexibility of accurate physics modeling and a general description of system geometry. The authors' goal was to develop techniques for applying statistical IR to tomosynthesis imaging data. METHODS: These techniques include the following: a physics model with a local voxel-pair based prior with flexible parameters to fine-tune image quality; a precomputed parameter lambda in the prior, to remove data dependence and to achieve a uniform resolution property; an effective ray-driven technique to compute the forward and backprojection; and an oversampled, ray-driven method to perform high resolution reconstruction with a practical region-of-interest technique. To assess the performance of these techniques, the authors acquired phantom data on the stationary DBT prototype system. To solve the estimation problem, the authors proposed an optimization-transfer based algorithm framework that potentially allows fewer iterations to achieve an acceptably converged reconstruction. RESULTS: IR improved the detectability of low-contrast and small microcalcifications, reduced cross-plane artifacts, improved spatial resolution, and lowered noise in reconstructed images. CONCLUSIONS: Although the computational load remains a significant challenge for practical development, the superior image quality provided by statistical IR, combined with advancing computational techniques, may bring benefits to screening, diagnostics, and intraoperative imaging in clinical applications.",eng,0

Wang,2012.0,Risk factors for surgical site infections after breast surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1016/j.ejso.2012.02.179,"BACKGROUND: Breast surgical site infections (SSIs) are major sources of postoperative morbidity and mortality, and it's established that surveillance of risk factors is effective in reducing hospital-acquired infections. However, studies about risk factors for breast SSIs were still under controversy because of limited data, contradictory results and lack of uniformity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the electronic database of PubMed for case-control studies about risk factors for breast SSIs, and a meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Eight studies including 681 cases and 2064 controls were eligible, and data was combined if the risk factor was studied by at least two studies. Of the 20 possible risk factors involved, 14 were proved significant for SSIs as follows: increased age, hypertension, higher body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, American society of anesthesiologists (ASA) 3 or 4, previous breast biopsy or operation, preoperative chemoradiation, conservation therapy versus other surgical approaches, hematoma, seroma, more intraoperative bleeding, postoperative drain, longer drainage time and second drainage tube placed. However, other factors like smoking habit, immediate reconstruction, axillary lymph node dissection, preoperative chemotherapy, corticosteroid usage and prophylactic antibiotic didn't show statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provided a list of predictable or preventable factors that could be taken measures to reduce the rate of breast SSIs and excluded some negligible factors. This could be useful for developing effective prevention and treatment policies for patients with SSIs and improving the overall quality of life.",eng,0

Gong,2014.0,[The value of chest X-ray and cervical vascular ultrasound in predicting the presence of non-recurrent laryngeal nerves],", ","OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of chest X-ray and cervical vascular ultrasound in predicting the presence of non-recurrent laryngeal nerves (NRLN) in patients with thyroid disorders. METHODS: Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative documents of 2 251 patients with various thyroid disorders between January 2006 and December 2013 were reviewed. All of the patients underwent preoperative chest X-ray examinations. The patients who had confirmed NRLN during surgery were given a cervical vascular ultrasound examination postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients (2. 18%, A group) were identified having NRLN by preoperative chest X-ray as they showed aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA). Of those suspected cases of NRLN, 23 (46.94%) were confirmed during subsequent surgeries and no NRLN injury was inflicted. In the 2 202 unsuspected cases (B group), 5 (0. 23%) were discovered having NRLN during surgeries, and one (20. 00%) NRLN injury occurred. ARSA were found in postoperative cervical vascular ultrasound examination in all of the 28 cases of NRLN confirmed during surgeries. The postoperative cervical vascular ultrasound suggested a normal right subclavian artery (RSA) for the 26 chest X-ray revealed but surgically dismissed cases of NRLN. The 23 X-ray predicted NRLN were revealed more quickly in surgeries than those that had been failed to show in X-ray (t= -18. 867 2, P=O. 000 0). CONCLUSION: Chest X-ray of patients scheduled for thyroid surgery should be reviewed carefully and cervical vascular ultrasound should be allied for predicting ARSA before surgery. Detection of ARSA can accurately predict the existence of NRLN, preventing NRLN injury and shorten the duration of subsequent operations.",chi,0

Materials/Methods: Eleven pediatric sarcoma patients with primary tumors in the thorax and pulmonary metastases underwent DP-IMRT with chemotherapy for definitive treatment. Five patients had Ewing sarcoma (ES) and six had rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Median age was 12 (2-29) years. Five patients had multiple pulmonary metastases while 2 had solitary and 4 had malignant pleural effusions with or without pleural-based disease. Eight patients (5 ES, 3 RMS) had resection of their primary tumors and 1 ES patient also underwent a pulmonary metastasectomy removing 6 nodules. Median time to RT was 21 (15-31) weeks. Eight patients received 45-50.4Gy in 1.8Gy fractions to the primary tumor and 14-16.8Gy in 0.53-0.75Gy fractions to the whole lungs. Two patients, ages 2 and 4, received 12Gy intraoperative radiation therapy and 30.6-36Gy IMRT postoperatively. One adolescent with an 11cm mediastinal tumor received 36Gy to the primary tumor because of unacceptable risk of cardiac and pulmonary toxicity with full-dose RT. A representative case of a child with ES of a right upper rib was re-planned with IMRT plus standard AP/PA whole lung irradiation (WLI) for dosimetric comparison. Results: With 27-month median follow-up, 3-year pulmonary failure-free survival in all patients was 61%: 80% for RMS and 40% for ES. Five patients (4 ES and 1 RMS) experienced pulmonary failure at median 16 (9- 41) months. All of these patients received salvage chemotherapy with or without wedge resection. Only one of these patients, a 2-year-old with ES, achieved clinical remission and is alive and well 8 years from diagnosis. Of note, the only ES patient who did not experience pulmonary relapse had undergone pulmonary metastasectomy. There were no failures in patients with malignant pleural effusions. Our sample case demonstrated more homogeneous target volume coverage of the whole lungs and decreased mean dose to esophagus (15%), heart (31%), spinal cord (15%), and liver (19%) with DP-IMRT. Conclusions: The treatment of children with a primary tumor in the thorax and pulmonary metastases poses a significant challenge to radiation oncologists as normal tissue such as cardiac, esophageal, breast, and unaffected lung tissue will be exposed to radiation. DP-IMRT to treat the primary tumor and whole lungs is one solution to this technical problem. Initial data from this small series suggest DP-IMRT is feasible and produces superior sparing of critical normal tissues compared to traditional AP/PA WLI plus IMRT to the primary tumor.",,0

APBI delivers higher doses of radiation in fewer fractions to the post-lumpectomy tumor bed with a 1-2 cm margin, targeting the area at the highest risk of local recurrence while sparing normal breast tissue. However, there are inherent challenges in defining accurate target volumes for APBI. Studies have shown that significant interobserver variation exists among radiation oncologists defining the lumpectomy cavity, which raises the question of how to improve the accuracy and consistency in the delineation of tumor bed volumes. The combination of standardized guidelines and surgical clips significantly improves an observer's ability in delineation, and it is the standard in multiple ongoing external-beam APBI trials. However, questions about the accuracy of the clips to mark the lumpectomy cavity remain, as clips only define a few points at the margin of the cavity. This paper reviews the techniques that have been developed so far to improve target delineation in APBI delivered by conformal external beam radiation therapy, including the use of standardized guidelines, surgical clips or fiducial markers, pre-operative computed tomography imaging, and additional imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Alternatives to post-operative APBI, future directions, and clinical recommendations were also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",,0

Rivard,2011.0,Treatment planning of a skin-sparing conical breast brachytherapy applicator using conventional brachytherapy software,10.1118/1.3552921,"PURPOSE: AccuBoost is a noninvasive image-guided technique for the delivery of partial breast irradiation to the tumor bed and currently serves as an alternate to conventional electron beam boost. To irradiate the target volume while providing dose sparing to the skin, the round applicator design was augmented through the addition of an internally truncated conical shield and the reduction of the source to skin distance. METHODS: Brachytherapy dose distributions for two types of conical applicators were simulated and estimated using Monte Carlo (MC) methods for radiation transport and a conventional treatment planning system (TPS). MC-derived and TPS-generated dose volume histograms (DVHs) and dose distribution data were compared for both the conical and round applicators for benchmarking purposes. RESULTS: Agreement using the gamma-index test was > or = 99.95% for distance to agreement and dose accuracy criteria of 2 mm and 2%, respectively. After observing good agreement, TPS DVHs and dose distributions for the conical and round applicators were obtained and compared. Brachytherapy dose distributions generated using Pinnacle for ten CT data sets showed that the parallel-opposed beams of the conical applicators provided similar PTV coverage to the round applicators and reduced the maximum dose to skin, chest wall, and lung by up to 27%, 42%, and 43%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy dose distributions for the conical applicators have been generated using MC methods and entered into the Pinnacle TPS via the Tufts technique. Treatment planning metrics for the conical AccuBoost applicators were significantly improved in comparison to those for conventional electron beam breast boost.",eng,0

Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) involves twice-daily treatments more than 4 to 5 days, which could potentially improve convenience and adherence for women undergoing treatment. METHODS: We studied local therapies in about one-third of a million female breast cancer patients who were diagnosed between January 2000 and June 2011. RESULTS: We found that the use of APBI brachytherapy increased rapidly from .2% in 2000 to about 3.1% in 2008 and leveled off after 2009. The increased use of APBI did not reduce the percentage of early-stage breast cancer patients who improperly forego radiation (about 14% over the whole study period).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were treated using the strut-based brachytherapy device with conventional dose and fractionation of 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions. Planning goals for the planning target volume were V90 > 90%, V150 < 50 cc, and V200 < 20 cc. Toxicity was graded based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. Recurrence rates were also calculated. RESULTS: Median followup was 59.5 months for the 250 patients. Grade 2 or higher adverse events at any time for hyperpigmentation, induration, erythema, telangiectasia, breast pain, seroma, and fat necrosis were 0.4%, 3.0%, 3.0%, 3.0%, 3.9%, 4.8%, and 1.3%, respectively. The median V90 was 97%, V95 was 95.1%, V150 was 28.7 cc, and V200 was 14.2 cc. For those patients with a less than a 5-mm or 3-mm-skin bridge, the median skin max doses were 272 and 289 cGy, respectively.

There are four sizes with 6, 8, or 10 peripheral struts available for source dwell positions providing excellent dosing flexibility. Since the sizes were designed to fit multiple cavity sizes, a study was undertaken to evaluate the amount of target breast tissue treated with each device, and compare that to published data for other available devices. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 294 patients treated at five centers was undertaken to evaluate the size of the treated target breast tissue. Mean sizes and ranges of the PTV-eval (1 cm expansion of the cavity excluding the cavity volume, 5 mm below the skin and chest wall) were evaluated for each SAVI size. The data was further subdivided into patients with no normal tissue restrictions on the PTV-eval, and those with chestwall and/or skin restrictions. Results: A symmetrical expansion of 1 cm from the 6, 8 and 10 SAVI gives ideal PTV-evals of approximately 59, 74, and 110 cc. In this patient population, the 6 mini, 6, 8, and 10 strut device treated a mean and standard deviation (with range in parentheses) of 42.1 +/- 8.7 cc (20.5e55 cc), 58 +/- 15.3 cc (38.3e97.9 cc), 83.3 +/- 26.7 cc (20.6e138.9 cc), and 125.9 +/- 34.9 cc (53.5e212.9 cc). Review of the data confirms that proximity to the skin, chestwall, or both can reduce the PTV-eval. Published data on the Contura catheter demonstrates a mean PTV-eval of 89.7 cc (71.9e108.9 cc) and 94.9 +/- 12 cc (74.4e119.8 cc) for the Mammosite. Of the patients treated with the 6 mini or 6 SAVI with skin or chestwall data (235 of the 249 patients), 49.2% had the PTV-eval reduced secondary to either proximity of skin or chestwall. Of all patients treated, 54% had skin bridges less than 7 mm, 43% less than 5 mm, and 30% less than 3 mm. Dosimetry for the entire cohort demonstrated a V90% (volume receiving 90% of the dose) of 96% and V200 (volume of tissue receiving 200% of the dose) of 7.0cc. (Table presented) Conclusions: As expected, the size of the PTV-eval increases with size of SAVI catheter device. In this study, the 8 and 10 strut device treat an equivalent PTV-eval size well within the ranges published for MammoSite and Contura. The 6 mini and 6 devices, while treating less normal tissue, were usually chosen secondary to normal tissue proximity restrictions, limiting the amount of target tissue necessary. In fact, many of these patients would not be eligible for balloon brachytherapy only based on skin proximity of <5 mm and <3 mm, disregarding chestwall proximity.",,0

Overall dosimetry is outstanding (median percent of target volume receiving 90% of the prescription dose was 95.9%, volume of target receiving 150% of the prescription dose was 27.8 mL, and volume of target receiving 200% of the prescription dose was 14.0 cm<sup>3</sup>). No devices were pulled prior to treatment completion. For patients with a skin bridge of less than 7 mm, the maximum median skin dose was 280 cGy (median percent of target volume receiving 90% of the prescription dose was 95.2%, volume of target receiving 150% of the prescription dose was 25.8 cm<sup>3</sup> and volume of target receiving 200% of the prescription dose was 12.7 mL). For patients with both chest wall and skin of less than 7 mm, the maximum median lung dose was 205 cGy with simultaneous skin dose of 272 cGy. The rate of telangiectasia was 1.9%. Grade 1 hyperpigmentation developed in 10 patients (9.8%) and Grade 2 fibrosis in 2 patients (1.9%). There were 2 symptomatic seromas and 2 cases of asymptomatic fat necrosis (1.9%). Of the patients, 27% were not eligible for MammoSite balloon brachytherapy (Hologic, Inc., Marlborough, MA) and 5% were not eligible for any balloon brachytherapy. The recurrence rate was 1%. Conclusions: The SAVI appears to safely allow an increase in eligibility for APBI over balloon brachytherapy or three-dimensional conformal radiation, highlighting the outstanding device flexibility to maximize the target dose and minimize the normal tissue dose. The device was well tolerated by patients. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",,0

Patients with advanced urologic disease are often treated with multimodal therapy, including surgical excision and postoperative radiotherapy. Delivery of intraoperative brachytherapy at the time of surgery is limited in part by the radiation source and a means of delivering the brachytherapy in a minimally-invasive fashion. The Xoft electronic brachytherapy device is portable and does not require operative room shielding. A minimallyinvasive intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) technique has been developed which utilizes the robotic platform, the Xoft electronic brachytherapy source, and minimally-invasive applicators. The feasibility of applying this system to a pelvic target in the porcine model was explored. METHODS: In-vivo trials were conducted at the David Jurist Research Institute at Hackensack University Medical Center after obtaining IACUC Board approval. A DaVinci standard Robotic Surgical System was used to manipulate minimally-invasive brachytherapy applicators and Axxent electronic brachytherapy catheters (Xoft Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). A porcine pelvic target was identified that served as a surrogate for periprostatic tissue in the human patient. RESULTS: Trocars were placed in a fashion similar to a prostatectomy template, with three robotic arms (8 mm trocars) and one 12 mm assistant trocar utilized. Two of the robotic arms were equipped with grasping instruments, and the third robotic arm was equipped with a forceps to manipulate the GafChromic paper. The Axxent electronic brachytherapy applicator was advanced through the 12 mm assistant trocar. While the minimally-invasive applicator was held in position with the robotic instruments, the brachytherapy catheter was used to deliver a prescribed brachytherapy treatment plan to the target. The minimallyinvasive applicator could access the targeted site. Optimal stability of the applicator required two robotic arms. On average, five minutes were required to introduce, place, and stabilize the applicator. CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive IORT system described above can be reproducibly deployed in-vivo. Additional in-vivo studies are needed to further characterize systematic and operator dependent variance and perform quantitative dose analysis.",,0

Kim,2004.0,Dose errors due to inhomogeneities in balloon catheter brachytherapy for breast cancer,10.1016/j.ijrobp.2004.05.039,"PURPOSE: To evaluate dose errors in balloon catheter brachytherapy of breast cancer due to inhomogeneities, such as iodine-containing radiographic contrast medium in the balloon, the lack of scattering medium, and the low density of lung that are not considered by commercial treatment planning systems (TPS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: By accounting for these inhomogeneities in breast/lung phantoms, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to calculate doses in the breast and lung. Doses were also calculated by a commercial TPS. The Monte Carlo doses and the TPS doses were compared along the transverse and longitudinal axes of the source. RESULTS: The Monte Carlo doses were lower by 4-10% on the prescription line than the TPS doses, depending on the concentration (5-25% by volume) of the contrast medium, and on the direction from the source. The lack of scattering medium around the breast contributes to the differences more than the attenuation by the contrast medium. Attenuation contributed approximately 1.0-4.8% at the concentrations investigated in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Current treatment planning systems, which assume a source in a large homogeneous water-equivalent medium, significantly overestimate doses in breast brachytherapy.",eng,0

Aim: The purpose of this work is to check the dose delivered to the patients during intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IOERT) in the conservative treatment of breast cancer, by means of reference dose measurement using radiochromic (EBT-2) films. Material and methods: Ninety patients with early-stage breast cancer underwent exclusive IOERT to the tumour bed using a LIAC linear accelerator. Absolute dose measurements were done with film pieces. After irradiation, the pixel values of the films were obtained via MATLAB and ImageJ softwares. Calibration curve was also used for calculating net optical density. Expected dose was compared to the patient delivered dose. Results: The mean deviation of the delivered dose from the expected one was 2.56% that is well in the accepted criteria. Only in one case, there was a larger deviation due to barometer miscalibration. Findings: EBT-2 film response is independent from dose-per-pulse and as it was shown in this study it can be robustly used during breast IOERT for dosimetric and also positioning verifications.

METHODS: The 1973-2004 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was examined for patients with T3N0M0 ductal, lobular, or mixed ductal and lobular carcinoma of the breast who underwent MRM, treated from 1988-2003. Patients who were men, who had positive lymph nodes, who survived < or =6 months, for whom breast cancer was not the first malignancy, who had nonbeam radiation, intraoperative or preoperative radiation were excluded. The average treatment effect of PMRT on mortality was estimated with a propensity score case-matched analysis. RESULTS: In all, 1777 patients were identified; 568 (32%) patients received PMRT. Median tumor size was 6.3 cm. The median number of lymph nodes examined was 14 (range, 1-49). Propensity score matched case-control analysis showed no improvement in overall survival with the delivery of PMRT in this group. Older patients, patients with ER- disease (compared with ER+), and patients with high-grade tumors (compared with well differentiated) had increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The use of PMRT for T3N0M0 breast carcinoma after MRM is not associated with an increase in overall survival. It was not possible to analyze local control in this study given the limitations of the SEER database. The impact of potential improvement in local control as it relates to overall survival should be the subject of further investigation.",eng,0

Despite the correlation between bone marrow micrometastases and poor outcome in breast cancer patients, bone marrow status does not yet have an established role in patient management. In this prospective study, adjuvant therapy recommendations for 43 patients with stage I, II, or III breast cancer treated with lumpectomy or mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillary dissection, and intraoperative bone marrow aspiration were recorded. Recommendations were made by a multidisciplinary tumor board both blinded and unblinded to the results of the bone marrow aspiration. In our study, 10 of the 43 breast cancer patients were found to have bone marrow micrometastases. Four of these patients (40%) had axillary lymph node metastases. When blinded to the results of the bone marrow aspiration, the tumor board recommended adjuvant chemotherapy for these four node-positive patients, as well as two node-negative patients. When unblinded to the results of the bone marrow aspiration, the tumor board did not change its recommendations for any of these six patients. The remaining four node-negative, bone marrow-positive patients were not advised to have adjuvant chemotherapy by the tumor board when blinded to bone marrow status. However, once the tumor board was informed of the presence of bone marrow micrometastases, adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended for all of these patients. The results of this pilot study indicate that the presence of bone marrow micrometastases in breast cancer patients with stage I, II, or III disease does influence recommendations for adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly in patients with node-negative disease.",eng,0

We report our experience with the opportunistic harvest of IMLNs during FFBR. Therapeutic implications and patient outcomes are explored. METHODS: All IMV anastomoses for delayed (DBR) or immediate breast reconstruction (IBR), between 1997 and 2009 were recorded. Opportunistic IMLN harvests were identified and patient characteristics and outcomes recorded from review of case records. RESULTS: Of the 293 FFBRs, 43 patients had 46 IMLNs harvested during 20 immediate and 26 delayed FFBRs. Six patients had positive nodes (4 IBR and 2 DBR), and were offered post operative chemotherapy. Four received radiotherapy to the internal mammary chain. Three of the four IMLN+ve IBR patients have died of metastatic disease at 23, 33 and 55 months after reconstruction. The two IMLN+ve DBR patients were alive at 4 and 20 months. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Although routine biopsy of IMLNs for staging in breast cancer is not standard practice, if identified during IMV recipient site preparation for microvascular anastomosis, opportunistic biopsy should be performed due to the additional staging information provided and subsequent effect upon the predicted prognosis.",eng,0

METHODS: From December 2008 to March 2012, 75 breast cancer patients (ages 34-66 years) were treated with IOERT during breast conservative surgery. IOERT was delivered using a mobile linear accelerator. Suitable energy and applicator size were chosen to ensure coverage of the tumor with anterior and posterior margins of 1 cm and lateral margins of 2 cm. Patients with sentinel node metastases or younger than 40 years received 8 Gy as boost followed by post-operative external beam radiation therapy of 50 Gy/25F; the others had 15 Gy, prescribed to the 90% isodose depth. Adjuvant treatment consisted of chemotherapy (55 patients), hormonal therapy (59 patients), or combined chemotherapy and hormonal therapy (41 patients). The safety, cosmesis, and short-term outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 54 months (range: 30-66 months). Two (2.7%) patients developed post-surgical hematoma. Six (8.0%) patients developed mild breast fibrosis. Eight (10.7%) patients suffered from local pain. One (1.2%) patient experienced a post-operative infection. Sixteen (21.3%) patients developed Grade 1 pulmonary fibrosis. Forty-three (57.3%) patients had an excellent cosmetic result and 23 (30.7%) had a good cosmetic result. Three patients had an ipsilateral breast recurrence, with an actual 3-year local recurrence rate of 4.0%. One patient had an ipsilateral axillary recurrence, resulting in a 3-year regional recurrence rate of 1.3%. No distant metastases or deaths were observed. The 3-year disease free survival was 94.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative electron radiation therapy delivered prior to lumpectomy is safe and feasible for selected patients with early-stage breast cancer. Early side effects, cosmesis and short-term efficacy are acceptable, but a longer follow-up is needed for evaluation of late side effects and long-term outcome.",eng,1

The device can be inserted into the breast using 3 different techniques. This report describes these methods of insertion and correlates the technique with outcome data collected in a multi-institutional registry trial. METHODS: In the registry trial, MammoSite catheters were inserted either (1) at the time of lumpectomy into an open cavity, (2) after surgery with ultrasound guidance through a separate small lateral incision into a closed cavity, or (3) after surgery by entering directly through the lumpectomy wound (the scar entry technique). Device placement techniques in 1403 patients with early stage breast cancer treated at 87 institutions by 223 different investigators were documented in the registry. Data collected included number of cases of each technique, age of patient, tumor size, skin spacing, catheter pull rates and reasons, infection, radiation recall, cosmesis, and recurrence. RESULTS: Catheter placement at the time of lumpectomy was performed in 619 patients (44%), after surgery with ultrasound guidance in 576 patients (41%), and the scar entry technique technique in 197 patients (14%). The type of technique was not associated with age of patient, tumor size, bra size, catheter size, skin spacing, infection, radiation recall, cosmesis, or recurrence. There was a statistically significant increased incidence of premature catheter removals for pathologically related reasons with the open-cavity technique compared with the 2 postoperative methods secondary to final histology reports disqualifying the patient after MammoSite placement. CONCLUSIONS: These registry data show that the MammoSite catheter can be inserted with any 1 of 3 different techniques. A postoperative placement, after the final pathology report is issued, decreases the incidence of premature removal of the catheter because of disqualifying pathology.",eng,0

Surgical techniques and principals have evolved during recent experiences with APBI, and these are described in this review.

METHODS: Patients who met eligibility requirements for breast brachytherapy were implanted with the MammoSite device utilizing percutaneous ultrasound-guided technique. Additionally, to study optimal timing, a historical cohort of patients operated upon for breast cancer by two of the authors were analyzed to compare the intraoperative and postoperative candidacy for MammoSite placement. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 23 patients successfully completed brachytherapy after implantation, with only 2 (9%) requiring catheter removal secondary to unfavorable balloon positioning. There were no serious complications. Of 343 historical patients with breast cancer, 137 were intraoperative candidates for brachytherapy, but final postoperative histology disqualified 40 (29%).

However, subsets of patients remain at higher risk for inbreast relapse, yielding the need for identification of prognostic markers beyond classical risk classifications. Recently, miRNAs - non-coding RNA sequences of 20 - 25 nucleotides - have been described as potential prognosticators / predictors for breast cancer. The aim of this study is to correlate miRNA-profiles with local control after BCT. Materials and Methods: Between 01/1996 and 06/2008, 4371 patients were irradiated after breast conserving surgery (BCS) with total doses of 50 - 54 Gy (single dose 1.8 - 2 Gy ICRU ), in the vast majority either followed by a fractionated electron boost (10 - 16 Gy) or in 1355 cases preceeded by an intraoperative electron boost (IOERT) with 10 Gy (Dmax). From our institutional data base 85 patients with local relapse could be identified. In order to find three suitable matches for each of these relapse-patients, 622 charts were reviewed. Patients were matched according to tumor stage (TNM, UICC), grading, hormonal receptors, age at diagnosis (+/- 5 years), type of radiotherapy (IOERT versus or percutaneous boost), year of treatment (+/- 5 years). The study is divided into a pilot phase and a validation phase. Tumor and treatment related data were equally distributed in relapse and control groups (non-parametric testing, p-values 0.7 - 1.0). In the pilot study 16 patients with local recurrence were compared with 16 patients who remained free from relapse. After isolation of total RNA from FFPE samples, a screen of >1250 miRNAs was performed. Local control data were correlated to the median fold changes of differentially expressed miRNAs, thereby selecting candidate miRNAs for further validation by means of quantitative real-time PCR (qrtPCR). In the ongoing validation study 30 patients with local relapse are compared with 85 control patients. Results: The pilot study revealed a pattern of eight miRNAs that could differentiate patients with local recurrence from healthy matched controls (log-rank-test, p = 0,002). These eight miRNAs showed significant fold changes in the comparison relapse versus non-relapse patients (limma t-test, p = 0,05). Four of these eight candidate miRNAs were tested by qrtPCR so far. One miRNA could be validated. The qrtPCR success rate for each of these miRNAs was between 91,3% and 100%. The remaining four candidate miRNAs are currently investigated. Conclusions: MiRNAs could be potential predictors for local control after breast conserving therapy. Further translational studies combining the relationship between miRNA-profiles and clinical outcome are warranted.",,0

MicroRNAs (miRs) - short non-coding RNA sequences (21 to 25 nucleotides) - have been recently described as potential prognosticators and predictors for breast cancer. The aim of this explorative study is to correlate miR-profiles with local control after breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy. Methods: This explorative study is designed as a matched pair analysis that compares 16 patients who had local recurrence with 16 patients who had no local failure. Patients were matched based on tumor stage, age, type of surgery, year of treatment and type of boost application (IOERT or percutaneous). For each patient >1200 miRs were screened. To select the most de-regulated miRs the profile differences were quantified as median fold change (t-test). On top of that every single miR was tested (log-rank) for its predictive potential in regards local control. Results: The comparison by fold change revealed a pattern of 14 differentially expressed miRs (raw p<0.05, unadjusted for multiple testing). Another 10 miRs showed their predictive potential when tested individually (raw p<0.05). Conclusions: In the future, miRs could be possibly added to the panel of predictive and prognostic markers to individualize breast cancer therapy.

Methods: The SLNs were identified in 150 breast cancer patients between May 2000 and May 2007. <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled dextran (<sup>99m</sup>Tc-DX) was injected pre-operatively, then the localization of SLN was identified by gamma-detecting probe intraoperatively, finally the removed SLNs were confirmed by routine pathological examination. Results: The detection rate of SLN biopsy was 96%. The sensitivity, specificity, false negative rate, false positive rate, and accuracy of SLN detection were 93.4%, 100%, 6.6%, 0%, and 97.2%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value were 100% and 95.4%, respectively. Youden's index was 0.934. The false negative rate was associated with the selection of indication, anatomic variation, preoperative biopsy and radiotherapy, appearance of internal mammary SLN, multifocality, incomplete pathological examination and inexperienced skills. Conclusion: The false negative rate could be reduced to an acceptable degree gradually by strictly selecting indications for SLN biopsy, probing SLN location according to standard operating procedure, keeping seriousness, performing post-operative pathological examination.",,0

The use of radiotherapy to treat early stage breast cancer following breast-conserving surgery has markedly increased. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical practice of radiotherapy in China. Materials and methods. A survey concerning the characteristics of breast-conserving radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer was distributed to all radiotherapy departments in mainland China in 2009. The results were analyzed. Results. Three hundred and ninety-six departments replied (41.6%), and 328 (34.4%) launched breast-conserving radiotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy was the most common combination and was performed in 55.2% of the responding centers. The median time from surgery to radiotherapy was 9 weeks. Three hundred and nineteen (97.3%) centers treated the whole breast, 273 (83.2%) the supraclavicular area, 138 (43.3%) the axilla, and 85 (26.8%) the internal mammary region; 97.5% (310/319) of all centers performed irradiation of the whole breast in all candidates. One hundred and fourteen (41.8%) treated the supraclavicular area, and 37 (26.8%) treated the axilla in 1-3 positive lymph nodes. Eighty-six (31.5%) and 40 (29.0%) performed the corresponding irradiation in N2-3 patients. Fifty-six (72.9%) treated the internal mammary region for tumors of the center or inner quadrant. The conformal technique was used in 51.8% of the centers. Conclusions.

However, traditional WBI has a large radiation field and lengthy course of treatment. Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) has been recognized as an alternative treatment to WBI. Three main techniques constitute APBI: intraoperative radiation therapy, external radiation therapy, and brachytherapy. Intraoperative radiation therapy involves the application of therapeutic levels of radiation during surgery. This technique allows for the exact delivery of radiation beams to the tumor bed; strict precision is observed for equipment in this technique. External radiation therapy is performed by radiotherapists and physicists. This technique is easy to implement. Furthermore, the target dose distribution can be achieved because of the implementation of a treatment planning system. Brachytherapy includes multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy and mammosite therapy. Presently, mammosite therapy is widely used because of its facile procedure. However, clinical follow-up data are limited because of the short duration of APBI therapy. The selection of appropriate patients and optimal dosimetric distribution is needed before APBI application to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence.",,0

Journal Article,Z. Zhang; E. I. Parsai; J. J. Feldmeier,2007.0,Three-dimensional quantitative dose reduction analysis in MammoSite balloon by Monte Carlo calculations,", ","Current treatment planning systems (TPSs) for partial breast irradiation using the MammoSite brachytherapy applicator (Cytyc Corporation, Marlborough, MA) often neglect the effect of inhomogeneity, leading to potential inaccuracies in dose distributions. Previous publications either have studied only a planar dose perturbation along the bisector of the source or have paid little attention to the anisotropy effect of the system. In the present study, we investigated the attenuation-corrected radial dose and anisotropy functions in a form parallel to the updated American Association of Physicists in Medicine TG-43 formalism. This work quantitatively delineates the inaccuracies in dose distributions in three-dimensional space. Monte Carlo N-particle transport code simulations in coupled photon-electron transport were used to quantify the changes in dose deposition and distribution caused by the increased attenuation coefficient of iodine-based contrast solution. The source geometry was that of the VariSource wire model VS2000 (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). The concentration of the iodine-based solution was varied from 5% to 25% by volume, a range recommended by the balloon's manufacturer. Balloon diameters of 4, 5, and 6 cm were simulated. Dose rates at the typical prescription line (1 cm away from the balloon surface) were determined for various polar angles. The computations showed that the dose rate reduction throughout the entire region of interest ranged from 0.64% for the smallest balloon diameter and contrast concentration to 6.17% for the largest balloon diameter and contrast concentration. The corrected radial dose function has a predominant influence on dose reduction, but the corrected anisotropy functions explain only the effect at the MammoSite system poles. By applying the corrected radial dose and anisotropy functions to TPSs, the attenuation effect can be reduced to the minimum.",eng,0

Emerging evidence suggests that the efficacy of IR may also be attributed to its ability to engage the tissue microenvironment. IR induces extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and deposition. Here we investigated whether radiation therapy induces ECM stiffening and how and whether ECM tension influences the effect of IR in mammary tissue. Material/Methods: We studied the effect of IR in paired human breast tissue sampled before and after a single dose of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) using a 50kV X-ray device, prescribed to 5Gy at 1 cm depth. IR effects were assessed using IHC to monitor changes in DNA repair and mechanosignaling (H&E, 53BP1, YAP-TAZ; p-STAT3). Biomechanical changes in the ECM were also measured (Atomic Force Microscopy). To explore the relationship between ECM tension and IR response, we modeled nonmalignant structures in 3-dimensional culture using MCF10A human epithelial cells on basement membrane conjugated to polyacrylamide gels of varying stiffness (140-5000Pa). These exponentially growing acini were treated with single fractions of 0-14Gy IR. IR response was analyzed by assessing levels of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), clonogenic survival as well as changes in metabolic status (MTT assay). Results: The ECM within human breast tissue was rapidly stiffened after IORT. The increase in ECM tension was associated with enhanced p-STAT3 signaling, suggesting IR treatment may increase ECM tension by stimulating inflammation and enhancing chemokine signaling. Preliminary culture data indicated that MCF10A acini interacting with a stiff ECM (5000Pa) showed an IR dose dependent decrease in cellular metabolism, increase in apoptosis and significantly reduced clonogenic survival, independent of cell cycle and proliferation status. Thus, the effect of IR may be functionally linked to its ability to induce ECM stiffening. Conclusions: Our study shows that (1) IR rapidly stiffens the ECM in human breast tissue; (2) ECM stiffness sensitizes mammary tissue to IR; and (3) perhaps IR-induced ECM stiffening may be linked to tissue inflammation. These investigations will lead to a deeper understanding of the effect of IR on the breast microenvironment and the role of ECM in response to radiation therapy.",,0

This study compares the subcutaneous expander placement to the traditional submuscular placement and describes our early experience with the expander insertion plane-choosing algorithm. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients who underwent two-stage immediate breast reconstruction from May 2012 to October 2014 was conducted. All expander insertion planes were chosen using the same algorithm. Expansion, pain, and complications were compared between two groups. RESULTS: The study included 88 patients (158 expanders; 50 subcutaneous and 108 submuscular). The subcutaneous group had a higher intraoperative expansion ratio (p < 0.001), high first postoperative expansion ratio (p < 0.001), shorter duration of expansion (p = 0.02), less number of expansion visits (p = 0.002), and less average pain during admission (p = 0.004). Significant differences in the intraoperative and first postoperative expansion ratios in patients with postmastectomy radiation therapy were also found between the two groups (p = 0.005 and 0.01, respectively). Complications during expansion and after second-stage autologous flap reconstruction were comparable between two groups. CONCLUSION: The subcutaneous expander placement was associated with greater intraoperative and first postoperative expansion, shorter expansion duration, less expansion visits, and less pain. With the expander insertion plane-choosing algorithm, subcutaneous expander placement could be performed with comparable complications rates with the submuscular placement during expansion and after second-stage autologous flap reconstruction. Further studies can be performed due to the lack of long-term complications following second-stage implant reconstruction in the subcutaneous approach.",eng,0

METHODS: Data of 38 APBI patients were studied. Dosimetry for the treatment plans was performed using both the TG43 and TG186 dose calculation methods of the Oncentra Brachy v4.4 treatment planning system (TPS). Analysis included indices of clinical interest for the planning target volume (PTV coverage, dose homogeneity, conformity) as well as dose volume histograms (DVH) for the breast, lung, heart, rib and skin. Significance testing of observed differences between TG43 and TG186 results was carried out and the effect of target location to these differences was studied. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in the values of clinically relevant DVH parameters for the PTV and the organs at risk (OAR), except for the heart. Differences for the PTV are relatively small (<1% for coverage, on the order of 2% for homogeneity and conformity) with a slight TG43 overestimation except for the dose homogeneity. Percentage differences are larger for the rib and lung (on the order of 4% for Dmax and 5% for V10Gy, respectively) and maximum for the skin (on the order of 6% for D10cc), with a correlation of the observed differences with target location.

We retrospectively analyzed more than 500 SN cases, to suggest more precise indications for the technique. METHODS: 99mTc-labeled colloid was injected close to the tumor; lymphoscintigraphy was then performed to reveal the SN. The next day, during surgery, the SN was removed by using a gamma probe. Complete axillary dissection followed, except in later cases recruited to a randomized trial. The SN was examined intraoperatively by conventional frozen section, in later cases by sampling the entire node and using immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: In the first series, the SN was identified in 98.7% of cases; in 6.7%, the SN was negative but other axillary nodes were positive; in 32.1%, the SN was negative by intraoperative frozen section but metastatic by definitive histology, prompting introduction of the exhaustive method. In the randomized trial, the SN was identified in all cases so far, the false-negative rate is approximately 6.5%, and in 15 cases, internal mammary chain nodes were biopsied. CONCLUSIONS: SN biopsy can reliably assess axillary status in selected patients. The problems are the SN detection rate, false negatives, and the intraoperative examination, which can miss 30% of SN metastases. Our exhaustive method overcomes the latter problem, but it is time consuming.",eng,0

Accelerated partial breast irradiation is increasingly used in the hope of increasing convenience, decreasing sequelae and maintaining cure rates. Intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons is an attractive accelerated partial breast irradiation technique because collimator placement is under the direct control of the surgeon who removes the tumor, the skin is spared, shielding protects the chest wall and complete irradiation can be given in a single intraoperative session (avoiding 5-7 weeks of whole breast irradiation). Intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons seems as safe as whole breast irradiation; however, long-term results on local control and survival are not available yet. © 2012 Future Medicine Ltd.",,0

Journal Article,S. Zurrida; U. Veronesi,2015.0,Milestones in breast cancer treatment,10.1111/tbj.12361,"Modern treatment started in the 1880s with Halsted's mastectomy. The next milestone-a century later-was breast-conserving surgery, with equivalent survival but better esthetic outcomes than mastectomy. Sentinel node biopsy, introduced in the 1990s, was a milestone that permitted avoidance of axillary dissection if the sentinel node was disease-free. Chemotherapy was established for early breast cancer in the 1980s and its efficacy continues to improve; however side effects remain a concern, particularly since chemotherapy does not benefit most patients. External whole breast irradiation was introduced with conservative surgery, as it reduces recurrences. By the 2000s, 3-week regimens had been shown equivalent to standard 6-week regimens-easing pressure on patients and radiation centers. Intraoperative partial breast irradiation is potentially more beneficial as it permits complete local treatment in a single session; however, trials show that patients must be very carefully selected. From the 1990s irradiation technology was combined with imaging and computer technologies to produce equipment that directs radiation to more precisely defined target volumes, allowing increased dose to the target and markedly reduced dose to nearby tissues. Irradiation systems are evolving rapidly but are being implemented without data on long-term morbidity or efficacy, while costs rise steeply. The first targeted treatment was tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor inhibitor. Since its widespread use starting in the 1980s, tamoxifen has saved the lives or prolonged the survival of millions with estrogen-positive disease; it is cheap and has limited (but not negligible) side effects. The same cannot be said of newer targeted treatments like trastuzumab and pertuzumab, which, although effective against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive cancer, come with important side effects and huge costs. Breast cancer mortality is declining in rich countries, but treatments have become more demanding and more expensive, so the outlook for the increasing numbers of women worldwide who develop the disease is uncertain.",eng,0

The radiotherapy typically consists of 45 to 50 Gy delivered with external beam irradiation, followed by boost irradiation of 15 to 20 Gy to the tumor bed using electron beams or interstitial implantation. Pathological evaluation of the excised tumor, clinical assessment, and mammography are used to determine the tissue volume potentially containing a residual tumor burden and therefore requiring boost irradiation. In this paper we describe planning and implantation procedures for Quimby-type breast implants using Ir-192 seeds encapsulated in nylon tubing. This system deviates in several important respects from the requirements of the standard brachytherapy systems. For double-plane implants, optimized values of the interplanar spacing are given for a range of implant sizes, along with the corresponding target dose rates for 1.0 mCi seeds. We also describe a modification of the angiocatheter implantation technique, which allows the radioactive sources to be secured in place by a magnetic cap and washer, thus greatly facilitating the removal of the sources at the end of treatment.",eng,0

Radiation was given to a single or to multiple fields in a single dose of 10-20 Gy to each field. Location of the radioactive source in the operating room proved technically, economically and medically advantageous since it was cheaper, assured a shorter period of the treatment and delivered from patient transportation to a radiotherapy department and ensuing complications. The procedure did not interfere with postoperative period. The efficacy of the treatment modality will be evaluated as soon as sufficient end results have been obtained.",rus,0
