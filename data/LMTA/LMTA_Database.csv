Luketich,2009,Radiofrequency and microwave ablation of lung tumors,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jso.21334,"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Surgical resection remains the standard treatment for early stage, non-small cell lung cancer, and limited pulmonary metastases. However, many patients with resectable disease have significant comorbidities which preclude surgical resection. Radiofrequency and microwave ablation are emerging modalities of treatment for these high-risk patients. Here, we review the principles, common devices in use, and treatment results of ablative therapy for lung tumors. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",English,0

Huge progress in recent years has resulted from a variety of factors including improved systemic cytotoxic therapies, improvements in modern imaging techniques, safer surgery and better perioperative care. A multi-disciplinary team approach within high volume centres has individualised patient care and undoubtedly led to better overall survival for a variety of hepatobiliary malignancies. As well as this, the perioperative mortality rate associated with major hepatic resection has significantly reduced. Here, we examine some of the recent advances in the field of hepatobiliary surgery. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",English,0

Goldberg,2012,Synergy in cancer treatment between liposomal chemotherapeutics and thermal ablation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2011.12.002,"Minimally invasive image-guided tumor ablation using short duration heating via needle-like applicators using energies such as radiofrequency or microwave has seen increasing clinical use to treat focal liver, renal, breast, bone, and lung tumors. Potential benefits of this thermal therapy include reduced morbidity and mortality compared to standard surgical resection and ability to treat non-surgical patients. However, improvements to this technique are required as achieving complete ablation in many cases can be challenging particularly at margins of tumors > 3 cm in diameter and adjacent to blood vessels. Thus, one very promising strategy has been to combine thermal tumor ablation with adjuvant nanoparticle-based chemotherapy agents to improve efficiency. Here, we will primarily review principles of thermal ablation to provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of combination therapy, and review the studies on combination therapy, including presenting preliminary data on the role of such variables as nanoparticle size and thermal dose on improving combination therapy outcome. We will discuss how thermal ablation can also be used to improve overall intratumoral drug accumulation and nanoparticle content release. Finally, in this article we will further describe the appealing off-shoot approach of utilizing thermal ablation techniques not as the primary treatment, but rather, as a means to improve efficiency of intratumoral nanoparticle drug delivery. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",English,0

In this study, cirrhotic patients with ARDS after MCT were compared with others without ARDS. Methods: Four patients with ARDS after open MCT and 17 other patients without ARDS were compared in terms of preoperative status, intraoperative findings, and postoperative management. Results: The preoperative Child-Pugh score and intraoperative amount of irradiation showed no significant differences were observed. The postoperative cumulative water balance until the third day was 1,692 +/- 1,315 mL for the ARDS group and 165 +/- 1,524 mL for the non-ARDS group (P = .079), and by the fourth day the respective values were 1,992 +/- 1,585 mL and 66 +/- 1,685 mL, showing a significant difference (P = .049). The postoperative cumulative sodium administration until the third day was 510 +/- 132 mEq for the ARDS group and 362 +/- 122 mEq for the non-ARDS group with a significant difference (P = .044), and by the fourth day the respective values were 642 +/- 141 mEq and 477 +/- 160 mEq (P = .073). Of the 17 patients in the non-ARDS group, 6 were given aldosterone antagonist until the fourth postoperative day, but it was not administered to any of the patients in the ARDS group. Conclusions: The water balance and sodium administration have to be closely monitored to prevent cirrhotic patients undergoing MCT from developing ARDS. Aldosterone antagonist appears to be useful for the prevention of ARDS. © 2005 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.",English,0

Abtin,2013,"Interventions for thoracic metastases: Review of current strategies for treatment of pulmonary, pleural, and chest wall disease",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2013.03.027,"Objectives: To review current treatment strategies for thoracic metastases. Various forms of thermal ablation therapies will be discussed for management of pulmonary and chest wall disease including microwave, cryo-, laser, and radiofrequency ablation. Topics to be covered for management of pleural disease include chemical pleurodesis and indwelling catheter placement. Methods: Each modality of thermal ablation will be closely examined, including relative strengths/weaknesses. Case examples will be used to discuss the management of pleural disease, specifically malignant effusions. Adjunctive techniques will be included as needed. Results: Ablation therapies provide a quality alternative to metastatectomy in patients who are poor surgical candidates. The main goal of ablation treatment for chest wall lesions is to provide local palliation of painful lesions. Management of pleural effusions is accomplished through the use of temporary and/or indwelling catheters with or without chemical pleurodesis. Conclusions: Management of thoracic metastatic disease is complex and involves the use of multiple modalities and treatment strategies. To achieve total treatment in this location, the interventionalist should not only address metastases to the lung parenchyma, but also the pleural space and chest wall. (Figure presented).",English,0
Journal Article,Q. Z. Al-Tariq,2014,"Percutaneous strategies for the management of pulmonary parenchymal, chest wall, and pleural metastases",http://dx.doi.org/10.2214/AJR.14.12615,"OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this article are to review the indications for and technical aspects of various percutaneous strategies available for the treatment of intrathoracic metastases involving the parenchyma, pleura, and chest wall and to describe the relative merits of one of these strategies over another to determine the best approach to use. CONCLUSION. The thorax is a common site of metastatic disease with frequent involvement of the lungs, pleura, and osseous structures. A variety of interventional procedures and techniques are available for treatment and for palliative care of patients with this disease. Imaging-guided interventions include thermal ablation of metastatic disease of the lungs and pleura, catheter placement and sclerosis of malignant pleural effusions, and palliative pain management for osseous and soft-tissue metastases.",English,0

Tumor ablation has emerged as an important and efficacious treatment option for nonsurgical lung cancer patients. This localized minimally invasive therapy is best suited for small oligonodular lesions or favorably located metastatic tumors. Radiofrequency ablation has been in use for over a decade, and newer modalities including microwave ablation, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation have emerged as additional treatment options for patients. Ablation therapies can offer patients and clinicians a repeatable and effective therapy for palliation and, in some cases, cure of thoracic malignancies. This article discusses the available technologies and techniques available for tumor ablation of thoracic malignancies including patient selection, basic aspects of procedure technique, imaging follow-up, treatment outcomes, and comparisons between various therapies.",eng,0

Traditionally, BPFs are treated with surgery; however, patients receiving ablation are often poor surgical candidates and require minimally invasive treatment. The present report describes four cases of BPFs following ablation, which were treated with endobronchial valves (EBVs). In three of the four patients, the pneumothoraces resolved after valve placement. One patient required further treatment with pleurodesis. EBVs can selectively block inspiratory airflow while allowing expiratory flow with drainage of air and secretions. In select patients, EBVs are a viable treatment option for BPFs. © 2012 SIR.",English,0

Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. From December 2003 to May 2012, 64 patients were treated with MWA for a single hepatic lesion, in 64 sessions. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was treated in 25 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 3.33-cm; 95% CI, 2.65-4.18-cm; range, 1.0-12.0-cm), metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) was treated in 27 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 2.7-cm; 95% CI, 2.20-3.40-cm; range, 0.8-6.0-cm), and other histological-types were treated in 12 patients (geometric mean tumor size, 3.79-cm; 95% CI, 2.72-5.26-cm; range, 1.7-8.0-cm). Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method was used to analyze time event data. Chi-square and correlation evaluated the relationship between tumor size and treatment parameters. Results Technical success rate was 95.3% (61/64). Treatment parameters were tailored to tumor size; as size increased more antennae were used (p < 0.001), treatment with multiple activations increased (p < 0.028), and treatment time increased (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant relationship between time to recurrence and tumor size, number of activations, number of antennae, and treatment time. At one-year, K-M analysis predicted a likelihood of local recurrence of 39.8% in HCC patients, 45.7% in CRC metastases patients, and 70.8% in patients with other metastases. Median cancer specific survivals for patients were 38.3 months for HCC patients, 36.3 months for CRC metastases, and 13.9 months for other histological-types. Complications occurred in 23.4% (15/64) of sessions. Conclusion In our sample, tumor size did not appear to impact complete ablation rates or local recurrence rates for focal hepatic malignancies treated with MWA.",English,0

Intrahepatic recurrence after hepatectomy can be treated with repeated hepatectomy, transhepatic arterial embolization (TAE), percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT), or microwave coagulo-necrotic therapy. However, treatment for extrahepatic recurrence is also important in prolonging survival in some patients. METHODOLOGY: after radical hepatectomy in 155 patients, extrahepatic recurrences were found in 15 patients that underwent subsequent treatment. The interval between completing treatment for the primary tumor and the discovery of metastasis, the location and made of treatment of the metastasis, and the outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Distant metastasis was detected at a mean of 7 months after radical resection of the primary tumor. Location of the metastasis included lung, bone, and adrenal gland. Four patients had no intrahepatic recurrence and 11 patients had simultaneous intrahepatic recurrence. Six patients with intrahepatic and extrahepatic recurrence that underwent systemic chemotherapy had poor prognoses, and all died within 12 months as a result of progression of the intrahepatic tumor. Five patients with intra- and extrahepatic recurrence that underwent systemic chemotherapy combined with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy had relatively good outcomes; all survived for more than 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that to obtain a good prognosis for extrahepatic metastasis coexisting with intrahepatic recurrence, intrahepatic recurrence should be controlled by locoregional therapy, and extrahepatic metastasis should be controlled by systemic chemotherapy and/or irradiation therapy.",English,0

Smirniotopoulos,2014,Safety and feasibility of percutaneous microwave ablation (MVA) of lung tumors,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2013.12.189,"Purpose: Percutaneous ablation of lung tumors is a minimally invasive therapy for patients with primary or metastatic cancer who are not surgical candidates or in whom standard therapy fails. We present our experience with percutaneous MWA of lung tumors. Materials and Methods: 14 consecutive patients (3 male, 11 female), aged 64-89, underwent 17 treatments of 17 target lesions. 9/17 tumors were primary non-small cell lung carcinomas and 8/17 were metastatic (Colon n=2, Hepatobiliary n=1, Neuroendocrine n=1, Head and Neck n=4). Clinical evaluation was performed at baseline, 2 weeks, 30 days and 6 months. Response was assessed using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (n=13) at 6 months and classified as: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Progressive Disease (PD). Complications were reported according to Society of Interventional Radiology Grading System [1,2]. Results: Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status average was 0.9 (range 0-3). Mean tumor size for 2.4 cm (N=17, 1.2 cm-5.8 cm); mean tumor size was 2.6 cm (Primary N=9, 1.4 cm-4.5 cm) and 2.1cm (Metastatic n=8, 1.2 cm-5.8 cm). 16/17 treatments were technically successful with one unsuccessful case secondary to inability to place the probe safely through the tumor. 30 day, 6 month and 1 year survival was: 100% (n=14), 100% (n=11) and 100%(n=7). Response rates for primary and metastatic tumors were as follows: (Primary, n=6) CR 83%, PR 17%, PD 0 %, (Metastatic, n=7) CR 100%, PR 0.0%, PD 0%. One case of locally progressive disease was initially treated with palliative intent. Three major and 2 minor complications: pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement (3/17), pneumothorax without chest tube (1/17), self-resolved hemoptysis (1/17). Conclusion: Percutaneous microwave ablation is a feasible and potentially safe technique for lung tumor ablation with promising response rates.",English,0
Electronic Article,M. Bala Malgorzata; P. Riemsma Robert; R. Wolff; J. Kleijnen,2013,Microwave coagulation for liver metastases,10.1002/14651858.CD010163.pub2,"Background: Primary liver cancer and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma are the two most common malignant tumours to affect the liver. The liver is second only to the lymph nodes as the most common site for metastatic disease. More than half of patients with metastatic liver disease will die from metastatic complications. Microwave coagulation involves placing an electrode into a lesion under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance. The microwave coagulator generates and transmits microwave energy to the electrode. Coagulative necrosis causes cellular death and destroys tissue in the treatment area, resulting in reduction of tumour size.Objectives: To study the beneficial and harmful effects of microwave coagulation compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in patients with liver metastases.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) inThe Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, and CINAHL up to December 2012.Selection criteria: We included all randomised clinical trials assessing beneficial and harmful effects of microwave coagulation and its comparators, irrespective of the location of the primary tumour.Data collection and analysis: We extracted relevant information on participant characteristics, interventions, and study outcomes and data on outcome measures for our review, as well as information on design and methodology of the studies. Bias risk assessment of trials, determination of whether they fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and data extraction from retrieved for final evaluation trials were done by one review author and were checked by a second review author.Main results: One randomised clinical trial fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the review. Forty participants with multiple liver metastases of colorectal cancer and no evidence of extrahepatic disease were randomly assigned. Thirty of these participants (14 females and 16 males) were included in the analysis: 14 participants received microwave coagulation and 16 underwent conventional surgery (hepatectomy or liver resection). The diagnosis of colorectal cancer (Stage IB to IIIC; tumour (T)2 node (N)0 to T3N2) and liver metastases was confirmed by histological assessment. Mean participant age was 61 years. The tumours were resectable. The risk of bias in the trial was judged to be high.Participants were followed for three years. Mortality at the last follow-up was 64% (9/14) in the microwave group and 75% (12/16) in the conventional surgery group (risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.39), that is, no significant difference was observed. In the microwave coagulation group, 71%, 57%, and 14% survived 1, 2, and 3 years, and in the conventional surgery group, the percentages were 69%, 56%, and 23%. The hazard ratio calculated using the Parmar method was 0.91 (0.39 to 2.15).Mean survival time was 27 months in the microwave group and 25 months in the conventional surgery group, and the mean disease-free interval was 11.3 months in the microwave group and 13.3 months in the hepatectomy group. Differences for both outcomes were not statistically significant. Reported frequency of adverse events was similar between the microwave coagulation and conventional surgery groups, except for the required blood transfusion, which was more common in the conventional surgery group. No intervention-related mortality was observed. After treatment, the carcinoembryonic antigen level decreased significantly in both groups.Authors' conclusions: On the basis of one randomised clinical trial, which did not describe allocation concealment or blinding, and which excluded from analysis 25% of participants after random assignment, evidence is insufficient to show whether microwave coagulation brings any significant benefit in terms of survival or recurrence compared with conventional surgery for participants with liver metastases from colorectal cancer. The number of adv rse events, except for the requirement for blood transfusion, which was more common in the liver resection group, was similar in both groups. At present, microwave therapy cannot be recommended outside randomised clinical trials.",,0

Kleijnen,2013,Cryotherapy for liver metastases,10.1002/14651858.CD009058.pub2,"Background: Primary liver tumours and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma are the two most common malignant tumours to affect the liver. The liver is second only to the lymph nodes as the most common site for metastatic disease. More than half of the patients with metastatic liver disease will die from metastatic complications. In cryoablation, liquid nitrogen or argon gas is delivered to the liver tumour, guided by ultrasound using a specially designed probe. Ice crystal formation during the rapid freezing process causes destruction of cellular structure and kills the tumour cells.Objectives: To study the beneficial and harmful effects of cryotherapy compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in patients with liver metastases.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, and CINAHL up to December 2012.Selection criteria: We included all randomised clinical trials assessing the beneficial and harmful effects of cryotherapy and its comparators, irrespective of the location of the primary tumour.Data collection and analysis: We extracted relevant information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcomes, and data on the outcomes for our review, as well as information on the design and methodology of the trials. Bias risk assessment of and data extraction from the trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria were done by one author and checked by a second author.Main results: One randomised clinical trial fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the review. The trial was judged as a trial with high risk of bias due to the unclear report on the generation of the allocation sequence and allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data and the selective outcome reporting domain. The trial included 123 consecutive patients with solitary or multiple unilobar or bilobar liver metastases who were randomised into two groups, 63 received cryotherapy and 60 received conventional surgery. There were 36 females and 87 males. The primary sites for the metastases were colorectal (66.6%), stomach (7.3%), breast (6.5%), melanoma (4.9%), ovarian adenocarcinoma (4.1%), uterus (3.3%), kidney (3.3%), intestinal (1.6%), pancreatic (1.6%), and unknown (0.8%). The tumours were resectable and non-resectable.The patients were followed for up to 10 years (minimum five months). Mortality at the last follow-up was 81% (51/63) in the cryotherapy group and 92% (55/60) in the conventional surgery group (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.02); that is, no statistically significant difference was observed. In the cryotherapy group, 60%, 44%, and 19% of the participants survived 3, 5, and 10 years respectively, while in the conventional surgery group the percentages were 51%, 36%, and 8%. The hazard ratio calculated using the Parmar method was 0.71 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.09). Recurrence in the liver was observed in 86% (54/63) of the patients in the cryotherapy group and 95% (57/60) of the patients in the conventional surgery group (relative risk (RR) 0.9; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.01); that is, no statistically significant difference was observed. Frequency of reported complications was similar between the cryotherapy group and the conventional surgery group except for postoperative pain. Both insignificant and pronounced pain were reported to be more common in the cryotherapy group while intense pain was reported to be more common in the control group. However, it was not reported by the authors whether the differences were significant. No intervention-related mortality and no bile leakage were observed.Authors' conclusions: On the basis of one randomised clinical trial with high risk of bias, there is insufficient evidence to conclude if in patients with liver metastases from various primary sites cryotherapy brings any significant benefit in terms of survival or recurrence compared with conventional surgery In addition, there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cryotherapy when compared with no intervention. At present, cryotherapy cannot be recommended outside randomised clinical trials.",,0

Electronic Article,E. Bandeira-Echtler; K. Bergerhoff; B. Richter,2014,Levothyroxine or minimally invasive therapies for benign thyroid nodules,10.1002/14651858.CD004098.pub2,"Background: Thyroid nodules (TN) are common in the adult population. Some physicians use suppressive levothyroxine (LT4) therapy to achieve a reduction in the number and volume of TN. In addition, minimally invasive treatments, such as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) sclerotherapy, laser photocoagulation (LP), and microwave (MW), radiofrequency (RF) and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation, have been proposed, especially for pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints, as an alternative to surgery. However, the risk to benefit ratio of all treatments for benign TN is currently unknown.Objectives: To assess the effects of LT4 or minimally invasive therapies (PEI, LP, and RF/HIFU/MW ablation) on benign TN.Search methods: We identified studies from computerised searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS (all performed up to April 2014). We also searched trial registers, examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted study authors.Selection criteria: We included studies if they were RCTs of LT4, PEI, LP, RF, HIFU or MW therapy in participants with an established diagnosis of benign TN. We excluded trials investigating the prevention of recurrence of thyroid disease after surgery, irradiation or treatment with radioiodine.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of included studies by visually inspecting forest plots and quantifying the diversity using the I² statistic. We synthesised data using random-effects model meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.Main results: Thirty-one studies randomised 2952 outpatients to investigate the effects of different therapies on benign TN. Studies on LT4, PEI, LP and RF ablation therapy randomised 2083, 607, 192 and 70 participants, respectively. We found no RCTs of HIFU or MW ablation therapy in benign TN. The duration of treatment varied according to the applied therapies: up to five years for LT4 and one to three PEI ablations, one to three LP sessions and one or two RF sessions. Median follow-up was 12 months for LT4 and six months for minimally invasive therapies. Evidence was of low-to-moderate quality, and risk of performance and detection bias for subjective outcomes was high in most trials.No study evaluated all-cause mortality or health-related quality of life. Only one LT4 study provided some data on the development of thyroid cancer, reporting no abnormal cytological findings. One LP study provided limited information on costs of treatment.LT4 compared with no treatment or placebo was associated with a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in 16% compared with 10% of participants after 6 to 24 months of follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 2.38); P = 0.03; 958 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints were not investigated in LT4 studies. LT4 therapy was generally well tolerated: three studies provided quantitative data on signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which were observed in 25% of LT4-treated versus 7% of placebo-treated participants at 12 to 18 months of follow-up (269 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).PEI compared with cyst aspiration only was associated with a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in 83% compared with 44% of participants after 1 to 24 months of follow-up (RR 1.83 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.54); P = 0.0003; 105 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence). Improvements in neck compression symptoms after 6 to 12 months of follow-up were seen in 78% of participants receiving PEI versus 38% of those in comparator groups. No reliable summary effect estimate could be established, RR ranged from 1.0 to 3.06 in favour of PEI (370 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). In all trials, participants experienced periprocedural cervical tenderness and light-to-moderat pain usually lasting from minutes to several hours. As a result of the PEI procedure, 26% of participants reported slight-to-moderate pain compared with 12% of those receiving cyst aspiration only (RR 1.78 (95% CI 0.62 to 5.12); P = 0.28; 104 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence).One study comparing LP with LT4 showed a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in favour of LP after 12 months of follow-up in 33% of LP participants versus 0% of LT4 participants, respectively (62 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence). A total of 82% of LP-treated versus 0% of untreated participants showed improvements in pressure symptoms after 6 to 12 months of follow-up (RR 26.65 (95% CI 5.47 to 129.72); P < 0.0001; 92 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). Around 20% of LP-treated participants reported light-to-moderate cervical pain lasting 48 hours or more (97 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).One trial with 40 participants, comparing RF with no treatment, resulted in a mean nodule volume reduction of 76% in the RF group compared with 0% of those in the no-treatment group at six months of follow-up (low-quality evidence). These RF-treated participants had fewer pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints after 12 months of follow-up compared with untreated participants (a 2.8 decrease versus a 1.1 increase on a six-point scale, respectively, with higher values indicating more severe symptoms; low-quality evidence). All participants complained of pain and discomfort during RF, which disappeared when the energy was reduced or turned off (low-quality evidence).Authors' conclusions: No study evaluated all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life or provided systematic data on the development of thyroid cancer. Longest follow-up was five years and median follow-up was 12 months. Nodule volume reductions were achieved by PEI, LP and RF, and to a lesser extent, by LT4. However, the clinical relevance of this outcome measure is doubtful. PEI, LP and RF led to improvements in pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints. Adverse events such as light-to-moderate periprocedural pain were seen after PEI, LP and RF. Future studies should focus on patient-important outcome measures, especially health-related quality of life, and compare minimally invasive procedures with surgery. RCTs with follow-up periods of several years and good-quality observational studies are needed to provide evidence on the development of thyroid cancer, all-cause mortality and long-term adverse events.",,0

Candinas,2014,"Computer planned, image-guided combined resection and ablation for bilobar colorectal liver metastases",http://dx.doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v20.i40.14992,"For patients with extensive bilobar colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), initial surgery may not be feasible and a multimodal approach including microwave ablation (MWA) provides the only chance for prolonged survival. Intraoperative navigation systems may improve the accuracy of ablation and surgical resection of so-called vanishing lesions"", ultimately improving patient outcome. Clinical application of intraoperative navigated liver surgery is illustrated in a patient undergoing combined resection/MWA for multiple, synchronous, bilobar CRLM. Regular follow-up with computed tomography (CT) allowed for temporal development of the ablation zones. Of the ten lesions detected in a preoperative CT scan, the largest lesion was resected and the others were ablated using an intraoperative navigation system. Twelve months post-surgery a new lesion (Seg IVa) was detected and treated by trans-arterial embolization. Nineteen months post-surgery new liver and lung metastases were detected and a palliative chemotherapy started. The patient passed away four years after initial diagnosis. For patients with extensive CRLM not treatable by standard surgery, navigated MWA/resection may provide excellent tumor control, improving longer-term survival. Intraoperative navigation systems provide precise, real-time information to the surgeon, aiding the decision-making process and substantially improving the accuracy of both ablation and resection. Regular follow-ups including 3D modeling allow for early discrimination between ablation zones and recurrent tumor lesions.""",English,0

Olivier,2013,Stereotactic body radiation therapy after other minimally-invasive local therapies for liver tumors,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2013.06.830,"Purpose/Objective(s): Several minimally-invasive local therapy (MILT) options are available to treat primary or metastatic liver tumors, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), chemoembolization (CE), cryotherapy, and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT); however, the safety and efficacy of SBRT after other local therapies is unknown. We retrospectively reviewed records of patients treated with liver SBRT after a previous MILT. Materials/Methods: Twenty-three patients with 25 liver lesions underwent SBRT after MILT. Common histologies were colorectal adenocarcinoma (n = 9, 36%), melanoma (n = 8, 32%), and non-small cell lung cancer (n = 3, 12%). Fifteen lesions (60%) received SBRT for local recurrence after MILT, and the other 10 (40%) were de novo lesions. Previous MILT procedures included RFA (n = 18; 72%), CE (n = 4; 16%), cryotherapy (n = 1, 4%), laser ablation (n = 1, 4%), and microwave ablation (n = 1, 4%). Median tumor size prior to MILT was 2.0 cm (range, 1.0-10.0 cm), and the median time elapsed between MILT and SBRT was 10.8 months (range, 0.4-71.5 months). For locally recurrent lesions after MILT, the median pre-MILT tumor size was 2.9 cm (range, 1.0-10.0 cm). Median SBRT dose was 60 Gy in 3 fractions (range, 28-60 Gy in 1-5 fractions). All but 4 patients (84%) received -1 cycle of chemotherapy prior to SBRT, and 15 patients (60%) received -1 cycle of chemotherapy after SBRT. Results: Median follow-up time after SBRT was 21.5 months (range, 0.1- 51.0 months). Three patients (12%) experienced bowel injury (ulceration/ perforation) after SBRT, all of whom had also received a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor immediately following SBRT. One patient died from liver failure. That patient had previously received CE for unresectable cholangiocarcinoma but also had a remote history of stem cell transplant for metastatic breast cancer. Local control (LC) at 12 months was 91%. For the 15 lesions treated with SBRT for local recurrence after MILT, 12-month LC was 100%. Twelve of the 23 patients (52%) had not experienced any liver recurrence, local or otherwise, at last follow-up. Overall survival (OS) at 12 months was 81%. Conclusions: SBRT provides excellent local control for liver tumors, even after other minimally-invasive local therapies have failed. While uncommon, serious late toxicity may occur, including bowel injury and death. Extra precaution should be taken in patients with prior risk factors for compromised liver function, even if baseline function is normal.",English,0

The importance of optimization relates to the observation that the cryosurgical treatment of tumors yields success only equivalent to alternative therapies. This is also true of all existing therapies of cancer, which while applied with curative intent; provide only disease suppression for periods ranging from months to years. Recent research has led to an important new understanding of the nature of cancer, which has implications for primary therapies, including cryosurgical treatment. We now recognize that a cancer is a highly organized tissue dependent on other supporting cells for its establishment, growth and invasion. Further, cancer stem cells are now recognized as an origin of disease and prove resistant to many treatment modalities. Growth is dependent on endothelial cells essential to blood vessel formation, fibroblasts production of growth factors, and protective functions of cells of the immune system. This review discusses the biology of cancer, which has profound implications for the diverse therapies of the disease, including cryosurgery. We also describe the cryosurgical treatment of diverse cancers, citing results, types of adjunctive therapy intended to improve clinical outcomes, and comment briefly on other energy-based ablative therapies. With an expanded view of tumor complexity we identify those elements key to effective cryoablation and strategies designed to optimize cancer cell mortality with a consideration of the now recognized hallmarks of cancer.",English,0

Methods: We performed a retrospective single-center evaluation of 64 microwave thermoablations of liver tumors in 46 patients (10 female, 36 male, mean age 66 years) between June 2014 and February 2015. Thirty ablations were carried out with manual guidance, while 34 ablations were performed using robotic guidance. A 6-week follow-up (ultrasound, computed tomography and MRI) was performed on all patients. Results: The total procedure time and dose-length product were significantly reduced under robotic guidance (18.3 vs. 21.7 min, (Formula presented.); 2216 vs. 2881 mGy(Formula presented.)cm, (Formula presented.)). The position of the percutaneous needle was more accurate using robotic guidance (needle deviation 1.6 vs. 3.3 mm, (Formula presented.)). There was no significant difference between both groups regarding the complication rate and the ablation success. Conclusion: Robotic assistance for liver tumor ablation reduces patient dose and allows for fast positioning of the microwave applicator with high accuracy. The complication rate and ablation success of percutaneous microwave thermoablation of malignant liver tumors using either CT fluoroscopy or robotic guidance for needle positioning showed no significant differences in the 6-week follow-up.",English,0

Methods: Between sept 2004 and feb 2013, 25 patients (mean age 62 years) treated for metastatic thyroid cancer (14 papillary,7 follicular, 1 medullary, 3 anaplastic) had thermal ablation for lung metastases by RFA or MW and were followed prospectively. The median delay between initial treatment of the thyroid cancer and the first interventional radiology session was 6 years (range 0.7-30.5y). The end points were local efficacy (assessed by computed tomography +/- PET/CT during the follow-up period), complications, and overall survival after thermal ablation. Results: A total of 58 lung metastases (1-16/patient, mean 1.5;1-4/session) were treated with RFA(33) or MW(6) during 39 sessions(1-7 sessions/ patient, mean 1.6). Median follow-up time was 32 months. The median duration of hospital stay was short (2.3 days). Moderate pneumothorax was the most frequent complication and occurred in 39% of the procedures. Infection occurred 4 times. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 90.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 78-100) and 85.7% ([CI]70-100), respectively. Only 2 recurrences on RFA or MW sites were noted during follow-up: one relapse at 3 months for an anaplastic carcinoma and one incomplete treatment for one lesion on four treated during one session for a follicular carcinoma. Conclusions: RFA is safe and efficient in the treatment of lung metastasis originating from thyroid cancer. RFA or MW may provide a low-morbidity alternative to surgery, being less invasive and preserving the patient's ability to undergo possible repeated operations. It could be a useful option when lung metastases are slowly progressive.",English,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All experiments were approved by an institutional animal care and use committee. A total of 18 ablations were performed in vivo in normal porcine lungs. By using computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic guidance, a 17-gauge cooled triaxial microwave antenna (n = 9) and a 17-gauge cooled radiofrequency (RF) electrode (n = 9) were placed percutaneously. Ablations were performed for 10 minutes by using either 125 W of microwave power or 200 W of RF power delivered with an impedance-based pulsing algorithm. CT images were acquired every minute during ablation to monitor growth. Animals were sacrificed after the procedure. Ablation zones were then excised and sectioned transverse to the applicator in 5-mm increments. Minimum and maximum diameter, cross-sectional area, length, and circularity were measured from gross specimens and CT images. Comparisons of each measurement were performed by using a mixed-effects model; P < .05 was considered to indicate a significant difference. RESULTS: Mean diameter (3.32 cm +/- 0.19 [standard deviation] vs 2.70 cm +/- 0.23, P < .001) was 25% larger with microwave ablation and mean cross-sectional area (8.25 cm(2) +/- 0.92 vs 5.45 cm(2) +/- 1.14, P < .001) was 50% larger with microwave ablation, compared with RF ablation.

Journal Article,C. L. Brace; J. L. Hinshaw; M. G. Lubner,2011,Thermal ablation for the treatment of abdominal tumors,10.3791/2596,"Percutaneous thermal ablation is an emerging treatment option for many tumors of the abdomen not amenable to conventional treatments. During a thermal ablation procedure, a thin applicator is guided into the target tumor under imaging guidance. Energy is then applied to the tissue until temperatures rise to cytotoxic levels (50-60 degrees C). Various energy sources are available to heat biological tissues, including radiofrequency (RF) electrical current, microwaves, laser light and ultrasonic waves. Of these, RF and microwave ablation are most commonly used worldwide. During RF ablation, alternating electrical current (~500 kHz) produces resistive heating around the interstitial electrode. Skin surface electrodes (ground pads) are used to complete the electrical circuit. RF ablation has been in use for nearly 20 years, with good results for local tumor control, extended survival and low complication rates. Recent studies suggest RF ablation may be a first-line treatment option for small hepatocellular carcinoma and renal-cell carcinoma. However, RF heating is hampered by local blood flow and high electrical impedance tissues (eg, lung, bone, desiccated or charred tissue). Microwaves may alleviate some of these problems by producing faster, volumetric heating. To create larger or conformal ablations, multiple microwave antennas can be used simultaneously while RF electrodes require sequential operation, which limits their efficiency. Early experiences with microwave systems suggest efficacy and safety similar to, or better than RF devices. Alternatively, cryoablation freezes the target tissues to lethal levels (-20 to -40 degrees C). Percutaneous cryoablation has been shown to be effective against RCC and many metastatic tumors, particularly colorectal cancer, in the liver. Cryoablation may also be associated with less post-procedure pain and faster recovery for some indications. Cryoablation is often contraindicated for primary liver cancer due to underlying coagulopathy and associated bleeding risks frequently seen in cirrhotic patients. In addition, sudden release of tumor cellular contents when the frozen tissue thaws can lead to a potentially serious condition known as cryoshock. Thermal tumor ablation can be performed at open surgery, laparoscopy or using a percutaneous approach. When performed percutaneously, the ablation procedure relies on imaging for diagnosis, planning, applicator guidance, treatment monitoring and follow-up. Ultrasound is the most popular modality for guidance and treatment monitoring worldwide, but computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used as well. Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI are typically employed for diagnosis and follow-up imaging.",eng,0

To discuss what is the role of imaging in patient selection 3. To clarify the complementary role of ablation in the management of lung cancer as compared with other treatments Lung tumour represents the neoplasm with the major incidence and mortality rates worldwide (1.35 million new cases annually and 1.18 million of deaths), with the highest frequency in Europe and the United States of America [1]. In Italy, from 1998 to 2002, lung cancer was found to be the fourth tumour in frequency among cancers diagnosed in women (4.6% of all female cancers) and third in males (14.2% of all male cancers), establishing the most frequent cause of cancer death in men [2]. Among the different histological types, the most common are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and among these, adenocarcinoma is the most frequent (30-40%) [2, 3]. The lung is a frequent site also for metastases, which occur in 30% of all cancers, especially from haematogenous spread. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a median survival of 6 to 8 months, and 1-year survival rate for only 10-20% [4]. The standard treatment for stages I, II and IIIa NSCLC is surgical resection, the unique approach with cure prospective and long-term survival [5]. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are frequently used as adjuvant and/ or neoadjuvant therapies to surgery [6, 7, 8]. However, only about one-third of the patients are eligible for surgery, and most of them have advanced disease at diagnosis [9]. Almost all patients have some comorbidities as poor pulmonary function, poor clinical conditions or advanced age and do not have sufficient clinical reserves to withstand a lobectomy or pneumonectomy [10]. Therefore, these patients are often treated with radiation therapy or palliative treatment [11,12]. Unfortunately, chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy did not influence significantly the outcomes of patients with unresectable disease; in addition, greater efficacy in these therapies is often accompanied by significant toxicity, especially for patients with associated comorbidities. There is no gold standard treatment for inoperable patients both, thanks to their advanced disease and also owing to high surgical risk due to poor clinical conditions [13]. Therefore, the use of alternatives to conventional therapies such as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), thermal laser ablation, cryoablation, radiofrequency (RFA) and microwave (MWA), proves to be a good treatment option. Among these different therapies, the RFA has enjoyed a longer application and greater success, and was promptly introduced into clinical practice [14,15]. The latest advancements in minimally invasive treatment for lung cancer are the MWA, which offer many of the RF benefits associated with theoretical advantages [16]. Rose et al. [17] proposed guidelines for papers about lung tumours thermal ablation. Patient selection was emphasized once thermal ablation is not a gold standard treatment of lung cancer; the patient selection criteria should always be clearly described. The first point is regarding biopsy; that should always be performed to confirm the diagnosis of malignancy [18]. In our study, biopsy was performed in all patients as for the majority of papers in Literature, though some of them use only clinical evidence as disease confirmation in case of metastatic lesions histologically known or recurrences, without performing biopsy [19- 30]. Coagulation disorders may exclude patients from selection for thermal ablation therapy [31-33], as reported in 9 papers, and some of them defined also an maximum INR value. CLINICAL CRITERIA: All patients who are supposed to undergo ablative therapies should not be subjected to conventional treatment or should have not answered to these treatments [32,34,35]. This decision is usually undertaken by a multidisciplinary team; in our case, the reference clinician (oncologist or pneumologist), the thoracic surgeon, the interventional radiologist an the anesthesiologist. Of the 24 studies analyzed, this information is found only in 12 studies [13,23,27-30,36-40]. The clinical criteria fundamentally consist in poor lung function (for which most centres establish an inferior limit of 1 L,), the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the different comorbidities changeable from Centre to Centre, responsible, in most of the cases, for ascertaining inoperability; the detected comorbidities were cardiopathies, haepatic cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, hemodynamic disorders, multiple sclerosis, aortic aneurysm, carotid stenosis, congestive heart failure, low performance status"", stable angina, valvular heart disease and high cardiac risk [13,19,20,24,26-30,36,39,41-46]. It is paramount that the decease risk for comorbidities do not exceed the decease risk for the tumour; otherwise, the patient automatically cannot be considered a candidate for thermal ablation [47]. Advanced age is considered in few studies [13,21,22,47] as an inoperability criterion; in our study it is indirectly considered. The employment of thermal ablation for lung metastasis is widespread and shows excellent results [13,20,48,49], in accordance with our study results. None of our patients underwent the thermal ablation procedure for surgical refuse; this ""inoperability"" reason was present in 18 [19,20,22,23,26-30,36-45] of the 24 reported studies. RADIOLOGICAL CRITERIA: Radiological selection criteria are lesions diameter, disease extension (number of lesions per hemithorax and extrapulmonary lesions) and adjacency to large vessels (>3 mm), heart and trachea [9,49,50]. The lesion diameter should not overcome 6cm if with a curative purpose, and when lager than 3 cm, it is preferable the MWA employment [20-22,51-57]. There are some divergences about the maximum number of lesions accepted for hemithorax; some centres accept until 9 lesions, our centre until 4 [34,35]. Extrapulmonary lesions are another divergence issue; some centres consider it as an inclusion criterion [13,19,28,30,32,34,3644,58,59] and other ones, as an exclusion criterion [27,40-42,46,60]. Our centre understands that, if controlled and recent, the extrapulmonary lesion does not exclude thermal ablation therapy, even if with palliative purpose, in accordance with findings of other studies [9,32,34,58,59]. The majority of the Centres exclude the patients with lesions in adjacency to heart, large vessels and trachea [13,19,22,29,30,38,39,47,60]; some studies report central ablations with success [60] as our study, which reports the success of a case in adjacency to supra-aortic trunks. In our study, there is the choice between RFA and MWA. Multiple are the advantages offered by microwave technology: lager volume of necrosis, reduction of procedure duration, mayor temperature to target lesions, the possibility to employ multiple antenna simultaneously, efficacy in lesions with cystic component and/or in adjacency to vessels > 3cm and less intraprocedural pain [49,51,61,62,63]. For minor lesions (< 3 cm) not close to vessels > 3 mm, it is immaterial whether one or the other technique [51] is employed. The failure of conventional therapies is another indication to thermal ablation [13,20-22,24,26,29,37- 39,41,42,45,48,59,64]. The refusal to undergo surgery [31,35] is another important thermal ablation criterion related in Literature despite there being no cases in our study.A clear exposition of selection criteria is still not a routine for Authors. For that reason is not momentarily possible to establish unambiguous thermo ablative therapies indications criteria. Whereas, it is necessary a randomized controlled study to comparing RFA and MWA to evaluate the best choice for the patient. In a near future, could be interesting to perform a randomized study comparing surgery and thermal ablation.""",,0

The latest advancements in minimally invasive treatment for lung cancer are the MWA, which offer many of the RF benefits associated with theoretical advantages [16]. Rose et al. [17] proposed guidelines for papers about lung tumours thermal ablation. Patient selection was emphasized once thermal ablation is not a gold standard treatment of lung cancer; the patient selection criteria should always be clearly described. The first point is regarding biopsy; that should always be performed to confirm the diagnosis of malignancy [18]. In our study, biopsy was performed in all patients as for the majority of papers in Literature, though some of them use only clinical evidence as disease confirmation in case of metastatic lesions histologically known or recurrences, without performing biopsy [19- 30]. Coagulation disorders may exclude patients from selection for thermal ablation therapy [31-33], as reported in 9 papers, and some of them defined also an maximum INR value. CLINICAL CRITERIA: All patients who are supposed to undergo ablative therapies should not be subjected to conventional treatment or should have not answered to these treatments [32,34,35]. This decision is usually undertaken by a multidisciplinary team; in our case, the reference clinician (oncologist or pneumologist), the thoracic surgeon, the interventional radiologist nd the anesthesiologist. Of the 24 studies analyzed, this information is found only in 12 studies [13,23,27-30,36-40]. The clinical criteria fundamentally consist in poor lung function (for which most centres establish an inferior limit of 1 L,), the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the different comorbidities changeable from Centre to Centre, responsible, in most of the cases, for ascertaining inoperability; the detected comorbidities were cardiopathies, haepatic cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, hemodynamic disorders, multiple sclerosis, aortic aneurysm, carotid stenosis, congestive heart failure, low performance status"", stable angina, valvular heart disease and high cardiac risk [13,19,20,24,26-30,36,39,41-46]. It is paramount that the decease risk for comorbidities do not exceed the decease risk for the tumour; otherwise, the patient automatically cannot be considered a candidate for thermal ablation [47]. Advanced age is considered in few studies [13,21,22,47] as an inoperability criterion; in our study it is indirectly considered. The employment of thermal ablation for lung metastasis is widespread and shows excellent results [13,20,48,49], in accordance with our study results. None of our patients underwent the thermal ablation procedure for surgical refuse; this ""inoperability"" reason was present in 18 [19,20,22,23,26-30,36-45] of the 24 reported studies. RADIOLOGICAL CRITERIA: Radiological selection criteria are lesions diameter, disease extension (number of lesions per hemithorax and extrapulmonary lesions) and adjacency to large vessels (>3 mm), heart and trachea [9,49,50]. The lesion diameter should not overcome 6cm if with a curative purpose, and when lager than 3 cm, it is preferable the MWA employment [20-22,51-57]. There are some divergences about the maximum number of lesions accepted for hemithorax; some centres accept until 9 lesions, our centre until 4 [34,35]. Extrapulmonary lesions are another divergence issue; some centres consider it as an inclusion criterion [13,19,28,30,32,34,3644,58,59] and other ones, as an exclusion criterion [27,40-42,46,60]. Our centre understands that, if controlled and recent, the extrapulmonary lesion does not exclude thermal ablation therapy, even if with palliative purpose, in accordance with findings of other studies [9,32,34,58,59]. The majority of the Centres exclude the patients with lesions in adjacency to heart, large vessels and trachea [13,19,22,29,30,38,39,47,60]; some studies report central ablations with success [60] as our study, which reports the success of a case in adjacency to supra-aortic trunks. In our study, there is the choice between RFA and MWA. Multiple are the advantages offered by microwave technology: lager volume of necrosis, reduction of procedure duration, mayor temperature to target lesions, the possibility to employ multiple antenna simultaneously, efficacy in lesions with cystic component and/or in adjacency to vessels > 3cm and less intraprocedural pain [49,51,61,62,63]. For minor lesions (< 3 cm) not close to vessels > 3 mm, it is immaterial whether one or the other technique [51] is employed. The failure of conventional therapies is another indication to thermal ablation [13,20-22,24,26,29,37- 39,41,42,45,48,59,64]. The refusal to undergo surgery [31,35] is another important thermal ablation criterion related in Literature despite there being no cases in our study.A clear exposition of selection criteria is still not a routine for Authors. For that reason is not momentarily possible to establish unambiguous thermo ablative therapies indications criteria. Whereas, it is necessary a randomized controlled study to comparing RFA and MWA to evaluate the best choice for the patient. In a near future, could be interesting to perform a randomized study comparing surgery and thermal ablation.""",English,0

To discuss indications and contraindications of interventional treatment 2. To analyse results of clinical trials 3. To understand the role of interventional therapies in the management of lung cancer The evolving field of pulmonary interventional oncology can be considered as a small integrative part in the complex area of oncology. The development of image-guided percutaneous techniques for local tumor ablation has been one of the major advances in the treatment of solid tumors. In patients who are deemed not to be candidates for surgery, various treatment strategies are available, including observation, conventional fractionated radiotherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy and RF ablation. While it is generally accepted that observation and conventional radiotherapies offer survival rates that are inferior to the other therapeutic strategies, respectively - 5-year survival rates in the range of 6-14% and 10-27% - there is no standardized, clearly established therapy to offer patients in this situation (1,2,3,4). According to the American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) either stereotactic radiation therapy or percutaneous thermal ablation should be offered to patients who are medically inoperable (5). For selected patients, these technologies offer an optimal treatment option given their availability in the outpatient setting and low associated morbidity and mortality. In the category thermal ablation"" all energy sources that destroy a tumor with thermal energy are included, either by heat (hyperthermal ablation) which include radiofrequency (RF), laser and microwave (MW) or by cold (cryoablation or hypothermal ablation). The main objectives of pulmonary tumor ablation therapy (and other malignancies) are: 1) to eradicate all viable malignant cells in the target volume, with a safety margin to ensure complete eradication, 2) minimizing the damage to certain targeted volume will provide a good functioning reserve of the rest of the lung. This is particularly important for patient with limited pulmonary functions due to extensive underlying emphysema and fibrosis (6,7). The potential advantages of local tumor ablation therapy over surgical resection might include: 1) selective damage, 2) minimal treatment morbidity and mortality, 3) less breathing impairment in patients with borderline lung function through sparing healthy lung tissue, 4) repeatability, 5) fairly low costs, 6) excellent imaging during the procedure and for follow-up and last but not least, 7) the gain in quality of life with less pain, much shorter hospitalization times with the interventions performed on an outpatient base or with overnight stays and thus a quicker re-access to social life (8,9). Lung ablation can be a reasonable therapy even for selected patients with more advanced cancer. Such patients would include those with stage IIIb disease (based on a second nodule within the same tumor lobe) or stage IV disease based on a satellite nodule within another lobe. In addition, patients with advanced stage disease who may be treated with RF ablation include those who have responded to definitive radiation and chemotherapy but have a persistent solitary peripheral focus of cancer, and those who present with a recurrent isolated cancer after previous lung resection (10). Percutaneous thermal ablation is generally indicated for nonsurgical patients with metastatic cancer limited pulmonary metastatic burden. Approximately 30% of patients with colorectal cancer have pulmonary metastases, and in about 2-4%, these metastases are isolated (11). The number of lesions should not be considered an absolute contraindication to RF ablation if successful treatment of all metastatic deposits can be accomplished. Nevertheless, most centres preferentially treat patients with five or fewer lesions (12). The target tumor should not exceed 3-3.5 cm in longest axis to achieve best rates of complete ablation with most of the currently available devices 6. Radiofrequency ablation is considered contraindicated in the presence of tumors locat d <1cm main bronchi and when tumors are associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis (12,6). Thermal injury of hilar structures must be avoided because of the risk of a severe hemopthysis (13). In experienced hands, thermal ablation of tumors located in the vicinity of major vessels, like the aorta, and the heart has been shown to be feasible. In these cases, however, the risk of incomplete treatment of the neoplastic tissue close to the vessel may increase because of the heat loss by convection (14). In contrast to existing thermo-ablative technologies, however, microwave treatment offers several key theoretical advantages in this and in similar situations. These include efficacy on lesions with a cystic component and/or in proximity to vascular structures >3 mm in diameter with a reduction in the heatsink effect, a larger volume of cellular necrosis, reduction in procedure times, greater temperatures delivered to the target lesion, the possibility of using multiple antennae simultaneously and less intraprocedural pain (15,16,17). In addition, MWA does not require placement of grounding pads (15). Patients with untreatable or unmanageable coagulopathy or with performance status >2 are not candidates for thermal ablation of lung tumors. The treatment is possible but at a higher risk of complication and should be performed by an experienced operator in patients that have undergone previous pneumonectomy or when lesions are adjacent to major vessels or to the heart (18,14). Patient records, complete history, physical examination, and prior imaging studies should be evaluated to determine the indication and the feasibility of RF ablation. Biopsy should be performed before RF ablation in patients suspected to have a NSCLC, to confirm the diagnosis of cancer; however, in some highrisk patients, it is better that the patient undergo the risk of the biopsy and RF ablation in one setting (19). In case of lung metastases, histopathologic or cytologic confirmation should be obtained whenever there is atypical presentation or very late presentation after the primary tumor (20,21). Pretreatment imaging must carefully define the location of each lesion with respect to surrounding structures. Lesions located near or adjacent to pleura can be treated with RF ablation, although their treatment may be associated with pleural effusion caused by pleurisy brought on by the heat conducted. However, pleural effusion is usually small in amount, asymptomatic, and thus clinically insignificant (22). Treatment of subpleural lesions may be also more painful, and an adequate pain relief strategy must be foreseen (22,23). Pretreatment imaging is also aimed in evaluating the planned trajectory and the conditions of pulmonary parenchyma. In fact, it has been shown that the length of needle trajectory through aerated lung and the presence of severe emphysema represent important factors for the development of peri and postprocedural pneumothorax (22,24). Therefore, the electrode trajectory should be chosen to avoid fissures, to minimize the amount of aerate lung that needs to be traversed, avoid larger vessels and bullae (12). Preprocedural laboratory tests should include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in patient with colorectal lung metastases and a careful patient's coagulation status. This includes measurement of the complete blood count, including platelet count, prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR). In some institutions the activated partial thromboplastin time, and/or cutaneous bleeding time are requested. An important issue surrounds management of antiplatelet (i.e., aspirin, ticlodipine, clopidogrel, IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and/or anticoagulant drugs (i.e., warfarin) before and after the time of RF ablation. Antiplatelet medications should be discontinued several to 10 days before RF ablation. Antiplatelet therapy may be restarted 48-72 h after RF ablation. Even anticoagulant medications should be discontinued prior to RF ablation. Warfarin should generally be discontin ed at least 5 days prior to RF ablation. Heparin and related products should be discontinued 12-24 h prior to RF ablation. Warfarin may be restarted the day following RF ablation. Clinical and imaging findings associated with a multidisciplinary team evaluation are the most important features to obtain high clinical efficacy and to avoid complications.""",English,0

Material and Methods: Between 2009 and 2012, 52 patients (62 tumors) were treated with lung percutaneous RFA under general anesthesia, using a conebeam CT (Philips Allura XperFD20) and fluoroscopic guidance. Xperguide software was used to plan a virtual needle trajectory. Tumor ablation was performed with multitine radiofrequency electrodes for 60 tumors (Leveen Boston Scientific), or microwaves, for 2 tumors (Amica). 21 patients were treated for primary lung carcinoma and 31 for lung metastasis from different origin. Primary endpoint was the local efficacy evaluated by CT or TEP CT. Secondary endpoints were technical success, evaluation of complications. Results: Median tumor diameter was 19 mm (range 7 to 50 mm). At the moment, median follow-up is 6,2 months IC95% [3.3-7 months]. During this period 2 local recurrences were depicted for 2 patients. Secondary endpoints: all the cases were technically successful and none procedure was cancelled. Pneumothorax was the most common complication and occurred in 13 procedures; 7 of them underwent additional chest tube insertions. The median time of hospitalization was 2 days. Conclusion: Cone-beam CT and live3D needle guidance is a useful technique for percutaneous lung ablation (RFA and microwaves).",English,0

Unfortunately, only about 20% of patients are eligible for resection. There are a number of options for extending resection to more advanced patients including systemic chemotherapy, portal vein embolization (PVE), two stage hepatectomy, ablation and hepatic artery infusion (HAI). There are few phase III trials comparing these treatment modalities, and choosing the right treatment is patient dependent. Treating hepatic metastases requires a multidisciplinary approach and knowledge of all treatment options as there continues to be advances in management of CLM. If a patient can undergo a treatment modality in order to increase their potential for future resection this should be the primary goal. If the patient is still deemed unresectable then treatments that lengthen disease-free and overall-survival should be pursued.

Materials and Methods: Over a 28 month period, 147 patients with unresectable liver tumors (39 women, 108 men; mean age 67) underwent 164 percutaneous CT guided MWA procedures using the Certus 140 2.45GHz gas cooled probe (Neuwave Medical, Madison, WI). A retrospective analysis was performed to review tumor characteristics as well as technical and clinical outcomes. Follow-up consisted of a clinic visit and CT or MRI at 1 month and every 3-4 months thereafter. Chisquare analysis and two sample t-test were performed to identify whether any tumor or patient related variables were associated with development of major complications. Results: A total of 164 tumors were treated (median size 1.8 cm; 0.6-8.2). Tumor size included: < 3cm - 142/164 (87%), 3- 5cm -20/164 (12%), >5cm - 2/164 (1%). Tumor pathology included: 148/164 (90%) hepatocellular carcinoma and 16/164 (10%) liver metastases. Mortality was 0% at 30 and 90 days. Median length of hospital stay was 1 day (range 0-17 days). The most common major complication was pneumothorax requiring chest tube in 7/147 (5%) patients.The second most common major complication was post procedure pulmonary edema requiring intubation in 3/147 (2%) patients.

Inoperability is due to poor either respiratory function in relation do COBP in primary tumours, and iterative surgery or general comorbidities. Pre-ablation imaging work-up must be equivalent to a pre-surgical one, namely with PET-CT. Because, size is strong redictive factor of success, the largest diameter f the tumour should be ideally smaller than 3 cm, and in any manner larger than 5 cm. A review of 17 of the most recent publication demonstrated a median reported rate of complete ablation of 90%, even if high variability exists between publications with a range from 38% to 97% [1]. Most studies report a statistically significant lower success rate of ablation with tumours larger than 2 to 3 cm in diameter [2 - 5]. Oversizing ablation relative to the tumour improve complete ablation rate up to 96% at 18 months ablation when the ratio between the area of post-RFA ground glass opacity and the tumour area before treatment was at least 4 [2].

The 27 patients with the largest tumours received external beam radiation (66 Gy) and the 14 patients with tumours less than 3 cm received brachytherapy through the puncture tract used for RFA. Combination treatment seems to improve results in NSCLC with 57% survival at 3 years. The median survival was 34.6+/-7 months for tumours larger than 3 cm and 44.4+/-5.4 months for tumours 3 cm or smaller (p = 0.08) [9]. Difference between overall survival [70% (95% CI 51 - 83%) at 1 year and 48% (30 - 65%)] at 2 years and Cancer-specific survival [92% (78 - 98%) at 1 year and 73% (54 - 86%) at 2 years] in patients with NSCLC highlight the comorbidities in the NSCLC patients treated with RFA [10]. The possibility to ablate larger volume gives hope for better rate of complete ablation for larger tumour even if datas about outcomes of MWA of pulmonary malignancies remain relatively scarce. Early reports are promising with the largest available clinical study includes 50 patients, including 30 with a non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with MWA during 66 ablation sessions for tumours 5 cm or smaller with a mean size of 3.5 cm+/-1.6 [11]. Tumour smaller than 2 cm were treated with a single antenna (53%), two antennae were used in 5%, 3 antennae in 27%, four antennae in 9%, and multi-probe loop antenna in 6%. 26% of patients had recurrent disease at the ablation site. This recurrent disease was most commonly found inn tumour large than 3 cm (p = 0.01). It is noteworthy that after MWA, on follow-up imaging cavitary changes were found in 43% of ablation and 6% results in documented infectious complications including one abscess and one pneumonia [11].",English,0

Journal Article,T. De Baere,2012,Results and complications,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00270-012-0437-6,"Learning Objectives 1. To present the results of RFA for primary and secondary lung cancer 2. To give an update on the complementary role of RFA with other treatments 3. To present the complications of RFA for lung cancer RFA provides 80 to 90% complete ablation at 2 years for tumors of less than 2 cm in most reports. The rate of complete ablation decreases when size of the tumor increases to be around 60% for tumors measuring 4 cm. For primary NSCLCC, the treatment is applied in non surgical candidates and the overall survival reported after RFA is in between 36 and 58%. The 3-year overall survival is reported to be better for small-size tumor (stage 1A) than for Stage IB or II NSCLC. Comorbidities and patient selection have high impact on survival. For lung metastases, there is growing evidence of survival after RFA, close to what was reported in large surgical series even if no comparative data exist. Age, disease-free interval, tumor size and tumor numbers which have been reported as predictive of survival after surgical metastasectomy are as well independent predictors of survival after RFA of lung metastases. The ideal candidate has less than 3 tumors of less than 3 cm. One of the beauties of RFA is that it can be easily repeated in case of occurrence of new metastases which is difficult with surgery due to the aggressiveness of the procedure. The same applies to stereotaxic radiation therapy where multiple irradiation results in toxicity to lung parenchyma, skin or mediastinum. The role of RFA is debated and its role in conjunction with chemotherapy and targeted therapy has to be evaluated. Follow-up with CT led to some delayed discovery of incomplete treatment, 4 to 12 months (mean+/-SD = 7.66 +/-2.77) after RFA. PET-CT appears promising to provide early evaluation of treatment response, but timing of PET after ablation is a key factor because G6PD uptake is highly increased 1 to 3 weeks after ablation with an SUV ratio of 5 and higher between RF ablation zone to muscle. Side effects and complications of RFA remain minor and allows treating patients with poor pulmonary function and comorbidities. Minor changes are found in patients with larger tumors or emphysema. After RFA there is no or very minor changes in post-ablation respiratory test and consequently major benefit of lung RFA to treatment of NSCLC is that it allows curative treatment in non-surgical early NSCLC. Moreover, this excellent tolerance allows safe treatment of single lung patients. New ablation techniques are under evaluation to overcome major limitation of RFA, namely heat sink effect close to large vessels or steep decrease in efficacy for tumor larger than 3 to 4 cm. These techniques include microwave ablation that allows to destroy larger tumor, cryotherapy that is less painful and allow treatment of tumor close to the pleura under conscious sedation, and IRE that due to non thermal destruction has specific features such as no heat sink effect, preservation of the vascular and tracheo-bronchial tree and nerve. The exact role of each of these ablation techniques has to be further evaluated in the spectrum of local treatment of lung tumors. No comparative data exist with other local therapy, namely stereotaxic body radiation, and such studies are needed to have evidence-based medicine supporting the use of lung RFA in primary and metastatic disease.",English,0

Today, RFA is a valid option for primary NSCLCC in nonsurgical candidates, with overall survival reported of 36%-58% at 3 years. For lung metastases, there is growing evidence of survival after RFA similar to that reported in large surgical series even if no comparative data exists. Age, disease free interval, tumor size, and tumor numbers, which have been reported as predictors of survival after surgical metastasectomy are independent predictors of survival after RFA of lung metastases. The ideal candidate should have less than 3 tumors that are less than 3 cm. One advantage of RFA is that it can be easily repeated in case of occurrence of new metastases, which is difficult with surgery because of the aggressive nature of the procedure. The same applies to stereotaxic radiation therapy where multiple irradiation results in toxicity to lung parenchyma, skin, or mediastinum. Consequently, today, RFA is part of routine practice armamentarium against lung cancers. However, many fields need to be investigated to improve efficacy and to better determine the role of RFA relative to other therapies. Investigation will be needed for the following: - To determine the role of various ablation technologies such as microwaves, cryotherapy, and irreversible electroporation in comparison with RFA, which is the most reported technique. - To evaluate the need and benefit of combining local ablation and systemic therapy. - To compare RFA with other local therapy, namely stereotactic body radiation therapy that has indications very close to percutaneous thermal ablation. These comparisons will help to determine the best treatment option in a given situation. Future trends in cancer treatment will favor minimally aggressive treatments and percutaneous ablation as well as any percutaneous thermal ablation. Such studies are required to use evidence-based medicine supporting the use of RFA in lungs in primary and metastatic diseases and to define the best target population for each therapy.",English,0

Such metastases can be the dominant part of the disease aswell due to the tumor burden itself or the symptoms related to such liver metastases. Intra-arterial therapies are commonly used in liver only or liver-dominant disease and encompass trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), trans-arterial embolization (TAE), and radioembolization (RE). TACE performed with drug emulsified in Lipiodol has been used for the past 20 years with reported overall survival in the range of 3-4 years, with objective response up to 75%. Response to TACE is higher when treatment is used as a first-line therapy and degree of liver involvement is lower. Benefit of TACE over TAE is unproven in randomized study, but reported in retrospective studies namely in pancreatic NETs. RE provides early interesting results that need to be further evaluated in terms of benefit and toxicity. Radiofrequency ablation allows control of small size and numbered liver metastases, with low invasiveness. Ideal metastases to target are one metastasis <5 cm, or three metastases <3 cm, or a sum of diameter of all metastases below 8 cm. Ablation therapies can be applied in the lung or in the bones when needed, and more invasive surgery should be probably saved for large-sizemetastases. Even if the indication of image-guided therapy in the treatment of GEP-NET liver metastases needs to be refined, such therapies allow for manageable invasive set of treatments able to address oligometastatic patients in liver, lung, and bones. These treatments applied locally will save the benefit and the toxicity of systemic therapy for more advanced stage of the disease.",English,0

Journal Article,T. J. De Baere,2010,Image guided therapy of metastases from colorectal cancer,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdq509,"High quality medical imaging available today allows the guided delivery of anticancer therapy for local treatment, including intra-arterial chemotherapy and percutaneous thermal ablation techniques such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA). RFA of colorectal lung metastases provides complete destruction in 93% [IC95% = 86-97] of tumors at 18 months. Overall survival and lung disease-free survival at 18 months were 71% and 34 % respectively. Tumor size remains a predictive factor of success, with the best results obtained in tumors less than 3 cm. In our experience, the rate of incomplete local treatment at 18 months was 5% for tumors measuring 2 cm or less, and 13% for tumors larger than 2 cm. The same applies to liver metastases treated with RFA, with over 90% complete ablation of small tumors away from large vessels. Survival of patients treated with RFA is usually lower than reported in surgical series in the literature. The most likely reason for this disparity is the nature of RFA patients, who tend to have more advanced disease and are therefore non-surgical candidates referred for RFA treatment. Nevertheless RFA has been demonstrated to be superior to stand-alone chemotherapy [in these patients (?)], and RFA must be proposed when possible in non-surgical candidates. Ruers, et al., demonstrated that there is an improvement in disease-free overall survival in the RFA group of a randomized controlled study comparing chemotherapy alone versus RFA+chemotherapy. New promising ablation modalities including thermal (MWA) and non-thermal (IRE) ablation are under investigation. Intra-arterial chemotherapy has become more viable due to 97% feasibility of percutaneous insertion of catheter and ports used for IAHC, thus avoiding surgery for implantation. In our experience, a 90% overall response rate has been obtained with first line treatment combining IAH Oxaliplatin plus IV 5FU and cetuximab in KRAS wild patient.

Such imaging is use for local drug delvery, namely intra-arterial hepatic chemotherapy and chemoemebolization.More recently percutaneous image guided therapy of cancer in curative intent has been developed to overcome limitation of surgery or to target non surgical candidates. Thermal tumor destruction such as radiofrerquency ablation (RFA) has developed since the late ninety's as a treatment of liver tumors with a curative intent. More recently RFA has been applied to various organs (Kidney, bones, adrenal , thyroid, &) inclUding lung with encouraging results. Other thermal ablative techniques (microwaves, laser, .. ) and non thermal ablative techniques (irreversible electroporation, ..) are under investigations. All these techniques require accurate probe placement to deliver the therapeutic stimulus and are linked with quality of imaging, anesthesia and miniaturization of the tools used for thermal ablation. Several type of imaging must be available ad potentially combined to treat the same patient (For example US guided liver ablation and CT guided lung ablation in the same patient during a single general anesthesia). Fusion imaging is also a useful adjunct when tumor are barely visible on one imaging modality. Computerization and automatic guidance system to target more accurately small tumor are actively developed by the industry and electromagnetic needle guidance is today a reality.Tools used for thermal ablation has greatly improve since the late nineties when initial version of probes and RF generators appeared. RFA is now able to produce more repeatable ablation and larger volume of destruction, thus improving results of RFA. Nevertheless some limitations od RFA remains such as impossibility to activate several probes at the same time, heat sink effect which is convection tissue cooling close to large vessels. In order to try to overcome these limitations new thermal ablations technique such microwaves (lees heat sink effect, several probes activated at the same time to provide larger volume of ablation) are under development. Non thermal ablation such as electroporation are reaching the clinical field and carries geat hopes of no heat sink etfect. In lung metastasis patients, after a minimum of 1 year of follow-up, the estimated rate of incomplete local treatment at 18 months was 7% PC95% =3 -14] per tumor. Overall survival and lung disease-tree survival at t8 months were respectively 71% and 34 %.Such techniques are highly effective in small size tumor and today, tumor size remains a predictive factor of success in the vast majorities of reports. Due to the fact that today ablation systems are able to destroy up to Scm, best results are obtained in tumor below 3 cm that give room for a 1 cm satety margin. Indeed, oversizing ablation size compared to tumor size allows better local tumor control, In our experience, rate of incomplete local treatment at 18 months was 5% for tumors measuring 2 cm or less had and t3% for tumors larger than 2 cm. Liver metastases treated With RFA demonstrateo a high success rate of ablation over 90% in small tumor size away from large vessels. However survaival of patients treated with RFA is usually lower that what reported on surgica l series. Several explanation to this lower surviva l does exist, including more advance disease in RFA population which is most olten proposed to non surg ical candidates. It is however difficult to propose RFA to surgical candidates due to the lack of complete abdominal exploration. Nevertheless RFA has been demonstrated superior to chemotherapy and RFA must be proposed when possible in non surgical candidates, At last Rues et al oernonstrateo that there is an improvement in disease free overall survival in the RFA group of a randomized controlled study oompari ng chemotherapy alone versus RFA+chemotherapy. Both lung and Iiver tumors can be treated during the same session. When both lungs h d to be treated, a two weeks interval is usuai between the treatments of the two lungs. Techniques are usually well tolerated and non surgical candidates due to poor general condition or insufficient lung or liver reserve to allow for resection can usually be treated with RFA. Even single lung patient can be treated. Alter RFA, an ablation zone larger than the tumor will be lett in place and morphological imaging might be delayed in the discovery ot incomplete ablation. IN liver tumors, CT or MRI are used to depict incomplete ablation and imaging is helped by contrast medium injection looking tor active/ vascularized tumor. Foci of High intensity ot T2 weighteo MRI imaging is also searched for. In the lung contrast enhancement is more difficult to evidence and consequently, there is an obvious room tor tollow-up with PET/CT that allows to depict incomplete ablation earlier that morpholog ic CT studies. Indeed in our experience incomplete lung ablation were discovered with after alter a median of 6 month while 85% ot incomplete ablation were demonstrated at PPETfCT at 3 months.

Selection bias and the retrospective nature of data do not allow for generalization of the results: the use of such approaches must be individualized and managed within a multidisciplinary team of dedicated specialists. Improvement in surgical and radiation techniques, development of new tools to deliver local chemotherapy, and new procedures (i.e. cryosurgery, laser and microwave ablation) mandate careful evaluation of such single and combined modalities in controlled clinical trials.

Methods: Eighty-nine nodules in 82 consecutive patients were studied. The 89 nodules were divided into two groups: a treatment group, with 82 primary nodules (average dimension was 3.4 +/- 1.2 cm) in 82 patients, and a control group, of seven nodules (average dimension was 1.4 +/- 0.6 cm) in seven patients. The criteria for a nodule's inclusion in the control group was that the nodule was one of two nodules in the same patient and that the two nodules were located in different liver lobes. This guarantees that while one nodules is treated by PMCT, the distant one will not be directly affected by the microwave thermal field. The control group nodules were treated after the study was completed. Specimens were taken with ultrasound-guided liver biopsy from the treated nodule and the control nodule, pre- and post-PMCT. Infiltration by T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, NK cells and macrophages in the tumour tissue were observed immunohistochemically using a panel of monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD45RO, CD20, CD56 and CD68. The extent of immune cell infiltration was compared both before and after PMCT, as well as between the treated and control nodules. The relationship between the prognosis and the extent of immunocyte infiltration was analysed. Results: The patients were followed for 2-26 months (mean 14.6 +/- 6.3) post-treatment. The recurrence rates at 1 and 2 years were 20.4% and 28.1% within the liver in treatment group, respectively. The survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 92.5% and 75.3% for the treatment group. T-cells, NK cells and macrophages increased significantly in both treated and untreated nodules after PMCT, albeit less markedly within untreated nodules when compared to the treated ones. There is a statistically significant correlation between survival outcome and the extent of immunocyte infiltration. Conclusions: For inoperable HCC patients, PMCT is one of the treatment choices shown to be effective. Apart from its tissue coagulation effect, an increased systemic immune response directed against the tumour may also play an important role in improved survival.",English,0

To define best candidates for percutaneous ablation 2. To present clinical outcomes of percutaneous ablation 3. To highlight contraindications for percutaneous ablation Multiple, image-guided, ablative techniques are being developed for use in patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or oligometastatic pulmonary lesions in whom surgery is not an option. Radiofrequency ablation is the most studied technique, but other approaches under development include microwave ablation, laser ablation, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation. Surgical resection is the standard treatment for patients with stage I and II NSCLC if pulmonary function is adequate and medical comorbidity does not preclude surgery. For patients who are surgical candidates and have a single or limited number of lung metastases and no uncontrolled systemic disease, surgical resection is the standard therapeutic approach. For patients who have either a small primary NSCLC or a single or limited number of pulmonary metastases and are not candidates for surgery based upon age, underlying lung disease, and other medical comorbidities or who refuse surgery, radiofrequency ablation, or other image-guided techniques may provide an important option, depending upon the presence of adequate local expertise. There are no trials comparing these techniques with each other or with external beam or stereotactic body radiation therapy. Current important clinical data will be reviewed.",English,0

Furthermore, conventional treatments that can be offered to these patients are beneficial only to a small percentage of them. Thermal ablation is a minimally invasive treatment that is commonly used in this group of patients, and which has shown promising results. Currently, the most widely used ablation techniques in the treatment of lung malignancies are radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, and cryoablation. Although the most studied technique is RFA, recent studies with microwave ablation and cryoablation have shown some advantages over RFA.

Methods: Consecutive patients with primary HCCs of <5 cm received Cryo or RFA/MCT between 1998 and 2011 and were monitored for local recurrence (defined as a recurrent tumor at or in direct contact with the ablated area) and overall complication rates. Results: The median tumor size was 2.5 cm in the Cryo group (n = 55) and 1.9 cm in the RFA/MCT group (n = 64; P < 0.001), but other patient characteristics were similar. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed Cryo as the only independent factor for improved 2-year local recurrence-free survival, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.3 (95 % confidence interval, 0.1-0.9; P = 0.02). Tumor diameter was a negative indicator of local recurrence-free survival (HR, 2.0; 95 % confidence interval, 1.1-3.5; P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis of patients with tumors of >2 cm demonstrated significantly better local recurrence rates in the Cryo group compared with the RFA/MCT group (21 vs. 56 % at 2 years; P = 0.006). Overall complication rates and incidences of Clavien-Dindo classification grade >III were identical (both P = 1.00). No in-hospital mortality occurred. Conclusions: Appropriate use of Cryo, as shown in this series, is safe and provides significantly improved local control for the treatment of primary HCCs of >2 cm compared with RFA/MCT.",English,0

Compared to standard CT-guidance, the addition of CAS-one could improve accuracy, reduce radiation dose and anaesthesia time. Method: Stereotactic instrument guidance is provided based on previously acquired 3D image data. By relating the position of the image data to real-time measurements of the patient position and instrument tracking, the relative position of the needle and the target are visualized without requiring CT acquisitions during needle insertion. General feasibility and safety of the navigated approach is assessed. Targeting accuracy is measured by calculations from control CT-scans. 20 patients scheduled for CT guided percutaneous microwave ablation, with 1 to 2 metastases, are selected from the Stockholm liver conference. Results: From March until July 2013, 11 patients (4 females and 7 males) of the planned 20 patients have been treated. 7 with HCC and 4 with CRLM. Median number of lesions treated was 1 (1-3) with a median size of 28 mm (10-42). Patients were discharged after a median of 1 day (1-2) without complications, but one patient showing a thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein at 30d follow-up. The accuracy of the navigated needle placement was 6.02 +/- 3.58 mm. In the analysis two patients were excluded because of malfunctioning targeting system. Conclusions: The procedure is feasible and continuing logistic and technical improvements have been accomplished. If this proves to be reliable a new group of patients could be offered a minimal invasive approach. It might even expand the indication for ablation in other organs like kidneys, spleen, lungs and pancreas.",English,0

Suh,2011,Evaluation of treatment response after nonoperative therapy for early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PPO.0b013e31820a0948,"Nonsurgical management of early primary lung cancer has grown tremendously in recent years, and today, available options extend far beyond that of conventional radiation therapy (CRT) to include minimally invasive image-guided delivery of thermal energies, specifically radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation, and more conformal stereotactic body radiation therapy. Because the tumor is never resected with these nonoperative interventions, histopathological evaluation of tumor margins for the presence of residual tumor is impossible, and as such, tumor response after each of these therapies is largely based on imaging. To date, computerized tomography and computerized tomography-positron emission tomography remain the most readily available modalities for assessment of therapeutic efficacy, and to this end as detailed within this article, strict imaging survey and familiarity with the expected imaging characteristics of the treated tumor will aid in recognition of unexpected findings, specifically those of incomplete therapy and/or tumor recurrence.

Materials and Methods: Whole blood was collected from 35 patients prior to thermal ablation and centrifuged to obtain serum which was stored at -80C until analysis. Whole blood was subsequently collected from the same cohort of patients within 24 hours after ablation (n=32) as well as 2-4 weeks after ablation (n=22), and processed similarly. Serum levels of IL-1a and TNFa (mediators of acute inflammation), IL-6 and IL-10 (Th2 cytokines), and IL-2 (Th1 cytokine) were measured using the Searchlight protein multiplex immunoassay (Aushon Biosystems, MA). Multivariate analysis was performed with mediator level as the dependent variable and patient/ablation demographics including primary diagnosis, metastatic status, ablation site (liver, kidney, lung, bone, soft tissue), thermal ablation type (RFA, cryoablation, microwave), and sample collection time as the independent variables. Results: We identified a 10 fold increase in the serum level of IL-6 24 hour after ablation when compared to pre-ablation; this increase persisted 2-4 weeks after ablation. IL-10 also showed a 2 fold increase 24 hours after ablation. Serum levels of IL-1a, IL-2, and TNFa did not significantly change following ablation. Multivariate analysis revealed that ablation site (p>0.57) and metastatic status (p>0.34) did not significantly contribute to changes in IL-6 following ablation. The only variables which significantly contributed to variation in the serum level of IL-6 following ablation were thermal ablation type (p>0.0001) and primary diagnosis (p>0.03). Cryoablation showed the largest fold change in IL-6 (>50 fold), with RFA and microwave ablation showing 3 fold changes. Ablation of melanomas had the highest fold change in IL-6 24 hours after ablation (54x), followed by ablation of kidney (26x), liver (8x), and lung (5x) cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole-blood samples were collected from 36 patients at three time points: before ablation, after ablation (within 48 hours), and at follow-up (1-5 weeks after ablation). Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured using a multiplex immunoassay. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using cytokine level as the dependent variable and sample collection, time, age, sex, primary diagnosis, metastatic status, ablation site, and ablation type as the independent variables. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the plasma level of IL-6 after ablation compared with before ablation (9.6-fold +/- 31-fold, P<.002). IL-10 also showed a significant increase after ablation (1.9-fold +/- 2.8-fold, P<.02). Plasma levels of IL-1alpha, IL-2, and TNF-alpha were not significantly changed after ablation. Cryoablation resulted in the largest change in IL-6 level (>54-fold), whereas radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation showed 3.6-fold and 3.4-fold changes, respectively. Ablation of melanomas showed the largest change in IL-6 48 hours after ablation (92x), followed by ablation of kidney (26x), liver (8x), and lung (6x) cancers. Multivariate analysis revealed that ablation type (P<.0003) and primary diagnosis (P<.03) were independent predictors of changes to IL-6 after ablation. Age was the only independent predictor of IL-10 levels after ablation (P< .019).

In addition to therapeutic benefits, CTLA4 therapy may induce immune-related adverse events (irAE). Studies on CTLA4 knockout and other CTLA4 deficient mice have resulted in splenomegaly, lymphoproliferation and fatal multi-organ destruction. The authors present a case of a 68-year-old patient who has developed splenomegaly following CTLA4 therapy. CTLA4 therapy's risks and benefits should be weighed carefully in the treatment of malignant melanoma. Larger prospective multi-center trials are needed to gauge the efficacy and complication rate of CTLA4 therapy. The authors propose that patients should get short-term surveillance imaging (CT or PET/CT) to exclude the multiple abdominopelvic complications and quickly terminate therapy if clinically warranted.

RF energy consists of an alternating current that moves from an active electrode that is placed within the tumor to dispersive electrodes that are placed on the patient. As the RF energy is applied, frictional heating of tissues results with cell death occurring at temperatures beyond 60degreeC. In most cases RFA is performed using a percutaneous approach with CT guidance. RFA can be used for patients with primary lung cancer and limited pulmonary metastases. RFA is most effective for smaller tumors (3cm or less), although tumors up to 5cm can be effectively ablated. Unlike resection, lymph nodes are not removed, and occult nodal disease may be missed, leading to local-regional failure as well as understaging of disease. When comparing results of RFA to surgical resection, and other new technologies such as SBRT, it should be considered that different definitions are used to define patterns of failure. Specifically local recurrence rates for SBRT and RFA are often quoted as being superior to those after wedge resection. However, in the surgical literature local recurrence will usually include hilar, sometimes mediastinal, as well as parenchymal recurrence within the same lobe, which is not the case with reports of nonoperative therapies such as RFA or SBRT. Another concern is that it is not guaranteed that there will be 100% tumor destruction with an adequate therapeutic margin when ablation is used, although ablation is more likely to be successful for smaller tumors, and may be improved with new ablation technologies such as microwave, cryotherapy or irreversible electroporation. Patients with stage I lung cancer can be considered in 3 groups; namely; 1) standard risk operable (usually treated with lobar resection 2) High-risk operable patients (usually treated with sublobar resection) and 3) medically inoperable (unable to tolerate any form of lung resection and usually treated with external beam radiation). RFA is a good option for the medically inoperable patients and may potentially be considered for some high-risk operable patients. RFA should be avoided for tumors closely abutting large vessels such as pulmonary vessels at the hilum. This is because there is a heat-sink effect that will prevent effective heating and cancer destruction, and additionally there is the potential risk of bleeding. RFA is effective for tumors in the lung periphery, as well as the middle 3rd of the lung, where lobar resection may be the only feasible resection available. In this case RFA will avoid the need for lobectomy, for a patient who is in the high-risk operable group.",English,0

Recently, with the increasing use of high-resolution CT scans, the rate of detecting tiny tumors in the peripheral lung, such as early stage lung cancer, small metastases, or atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) has increased. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is usually employed for many of these cases. However, we considered that more minimal invasive therapy is necessary for patients who are inoperable due to poor cardiopulmonary function, various complications, severe adhesion or advanced age. Percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) is considered a very useful modality for liver tumors. We applied this modality for lung tumors and examined the possibility of the PMCT guided by CT scanning for small lung tumors in inoperable patients. Cases. We performed CT-guided PMCT in a 66-year-old man with a new solitary, 2.0 cm metastatic lung tumor from colon cancer. He had received operations 3 times for bilateral lung metastases previously. We also treated an 88-year-old man with a peripheral type lung carcinoma 1.5 cm in diameter. The conditions of PMCT were 60W power with 3 minutes coagulation time. After PMCT a necrotic cavity in the tumor was observed by chest CT scan examination. Resections of the lesions after PMCT were performed in the two cases, one because of prolonged air leakage, and the other because of the strong request from the patient. Pathological examination by H. E. stain revealed extensive tumor necrosis, however, small amounts of residual tumor observed at the peripheral margin of the tumor in both cases were considered viable. Nevertheless, our results demonstrated the possibility of PMCT for patients with small peripheral lung tumors. Conclusion. CT-guided PMCT is considered to be a useful modality for minimally invasive therapy for peripheral lung tumors with the intent of palliative or curative treatment.",Japanese,0

Measurements of thermal response and coagulation area and histological examinations after microwave coagulation were performed in normal canine lung tissue. The temperature in normal canine lung tissue increased to 90-100degreeC at 5 mm from the electrode after 60 s and 70-80degreeC at 10 mm after 90 s at 40 or 60 W.

Liver resection is the only curative option, with one third of resected patients alive at five years. In those developing recurrence in the liver following resection, further liver surgery may be curative, with similar 5 years survival rates of about 30%. Until recently surgery was feasible in only 15-25% of patients with colorectal liver metastases. New strategies, such as downstaging chemotherapy, portal vein embolization and two-stage hepatectomy, may increase the resectability rate by 15%. Earlier detection of liver metastases would increase resectability, although good follow-up trials are lacking. Once suspected, colorectal liver metastases are staged by spiral CT, CT portography and MRI, which have similar overall accuracies. Mortality following liver resection is less than 5% in major centres, with a morbidity rate of 20% to 50%. Prognostic scoring system can be used to predict the likely cure rate with resection. Pulmonary metastases occur in 10-25% of patients with resected colorectal cancer, but are limited to the lung in only 2% of cases. In these selected cases surgery provides long-term survival in 20-40%, and repeat lung resection has shown similar rates. For patients with unresectable disease, chemotherapy and ablation techniques have been demonstrated to prolong survival, although chemotherapy alone has been shown to improve quality of life.",English,0

Methods: This mathematic model was a regular cylinder quantifying appropriate puncture routes from the bottom up. A total of 103 patients with hepatic dome tumors were enrolled and randomly divided into 2 groups based on whether this model was used or not: Group A (using the model; n = 43) versus Group B (not using the model; n = 60). All tumors were treated by CT-guided MW ablation and follow-up contrast CT were reviewed. Results: The average number of times for successful puncture, average ablation time, and incidence of right shoulder pain were less in Group A than Group B (1.4 vs. 2.5, P = 0.001; 8.8 vs. 11.1 minutes, P = 0.003; and 4.7% vs. 20%, P = 0.039). The technical success rate was higher in Group A than Group B (97.7% vs. 85.0%, P = 0.032). There were no significant differences between the two groups in primary and secondary technique efficacy rates (97.7% vs. 88.3%, P = 0.081; 90.0% vs. 72.7%, P = 0.314).

Gianfelice,2009,MR guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment of painful bone metastases,", http://ezproxy.surgeons.org/login?url=http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed9&AN=70339127","The treatment of painful bone metastases remains a difficult undertaking with multidisciplinary treatment approaches often achieving the greatest success. External beam radiation remains the treatment of choice for palliative treatment of painful bone metastases but up to 30% of patients do not achieve adequate pain palliation when treated with this modality. Other treatment options include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and bisphosphonates, which when added as adjuvant therapy can have beneficial effects. More recent developments include focal image guided therapies including radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, laser and microwave ablation in which energy delivered locally to the focal lesion results in diminished pain. MRgFUS is a new alternative method for the palliative treatment of painful bone metastases incorporating MR imaging coupled with a tumor ablating apparatus (focused ultrasound). The focused ultrasound apparatus consists of a multiarray ultrasound transducer situated in a water bath incorporated into a standard MR table. This transducer is able to produce high energy ultrasound waves, which can be focused on specific tissues in the body; this results in local temperature elevation and thermal necrosis of the area targeted by the ultrasound wave otherwise known as a sonication."" Treatment of a pathological mass is achieved by a 3D computer driven map that calculates the exact number and position of sonications needed to destroy the mass lesion. Each sonication results in a small area of necrosis, approximately 3x1 cm in dimension. The 3D images are provided by the MR scanner and obtained just prior to treatment initiation and are crucial in the computer driven mapping of multiple overlapping sonications necessary to achieve total tumor destruction. The unique feature of the system is the MR driven thermography. MR thermography allows accurate temperature estimate of the region treated with MRgFUS following each sonication, hence, allowing a true closed loop feedback treating method. If temperature measurements following a sonication are below a critical level (i.e., 60degreeC for 1 second), that region can be immediately retreated to assure necrosis has occurred. This is in contradistinction to all other ablation technologies where image guided ablative procedure is performed and the result is evaluated with imaging after the fact, in this scenario if treatment is suboptimal, another ablation session must be performed. Our initial series of patients with painful bone metastases included 12 painful bone lesions in 11 patients treated over a period of 14 months. This series included 7 women and 4 men with an average age of 58 years and primary tumors including breast, kidney, lung and liver. The large majority of lesions were located in the pelvic bones but lesions in the scapula ischium and clavicle were also treated. One patient had 2 lesions treated in close proximity; all other patients had a single lesion treated. All patients had a single treatment session with the exception of one patient in whom treatment had to be postponed due to a concomitant medical problem during the procedure setup; the treatment was completed on the next day without incident. Because bone readily absorbs ultrasound energy, the treatment of bone metastases requires fewer sonications (in our series varied between 12 and 18 sonications) and the energy necessary to achieve therapeutic effect is also diminished (approximately 1000J as compared to 3000J typically to achieve soft tissue ablation with this technology). Radiological features of the lesions treated included 8 purely osteolytic, 1 mixed and 2 osteoblastic. All treatment procedures were completed with the aid of conscious sedation delivered intravenously (on average 2.5 mg midazolam, 125 ug of fentanyl). The hypothesis of the study was energy directed at the bone overlying the painful metastasis would result in heating of the bone above 60degreeC; this would result in destruction of the periosteal innervation and hence render the patient pain free from the lesion All patients underwent contrast enhanced MR, unenhanced CT as well as completing both a pain scale score (0-10, 0 no pain, 10 excruciating unrelenting pain) and a quality of life survey prior to treatment and then these studies were repeated following treatment with MRgFUS. Average pain score in our patient population was 6 on a scale of 10 and this diminished to 0.5 on the three month follow up of our patient population. Most patients were completely pain free and almost all had ceased taking pain medications. Several patients had resumed light activity and were significantly more mobile following treatment. No adverse events were recorded in this small patient population; physical exam and imaging studies also were free of any occult adverse events. The imaging studies performed prior to and after treatment revealed interesting findings. The majority of patients in our series had purely osteolytic expansive lesions with cortical thinning overlying the metastasis. These lesions demonstrated homogeneous enhancement prior to treatment on contrast enhanced MR studies. Following treatment with MRgFUS, all lesions demonstrated areas of decreased enhancement on MR contrast studies suggesting energy had in fact penetrated the thinned cortex and induced thermal necrosis of the enhancing metastases. On follow up, uninfused CT varying degrees of sclerosis was noted in these previously purely osteolytic lesions suggesting new bone was being laid down in response to the necrosis of the tumor mass. The imaging findings suggest that energy does in fact traverse the thinned cortical bone into the medullar region. Palliation is in fact being achieved by the energy absorbed by the thinned cortical bone but theoretically local tumor control could also be achieved if enough energy could be transmitted through the bone to achieve total necrosis of the medullary mass. Future research protocols for MRgFUS include a pivotal study in North America, which will include at least 8 sites and up to 150 patients. More aggressive treatment protocols with goal to achieve as much ablation of the medullary component could result in a change in the goal of treatment, i.e., to ablate and control tumor growth locally and to achieve adequate palliation. Another exciting development being evaluated is the utilization of a portable treating transducer. This transducer type can be fixed on any part of the body and hence allow better access to difficult locations and can further increase the number of patients amenable to this treatment. MRgFUS is an exciting new method for palliative treatment of painful bone metastases. This treatment method has proven to be effective, rapid, with little or no adverse events and can be completed in one treatment session. With further development and evaluation, MRgFUS may become a first line treatment for the palliative treatment of painful bone metastases.""",English,0

Journal Article,A. Gillams,2012,How I do it,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00270-012-0437-6,"Learning Objectives 1. To describe techniques and devices used in lung ablation 2. To describe the imaging findings during and after lung ablation 3. Tips and tricks in challenging cases Lung ablation is the fastest growing area in tumour ablation, a recent spate of technical and practical enhancements has resulted in ever more patients who can be treated. Yet, there are still not enough centres offering ablation and still many untreated patients who would have benefited. Local success of ablation depends on tumour size and location. Ablation has been successfully applied to <3 - 3.5cm tumours, either primary or secondary (1, 2). Larger tumours are usually ablated in conjunction with another therapeutic modality such as radiotherapy (3). Location next to >3 mm diameter blood vessels or bronchi can, but not necessarily, result in incomplete ablation (4). Local recurrence is higher in primary lung cancer than in metastases and so a larger ablative margin is recommended. Standard work up prior to ablation includes full staging, documentation of the medical history, specific questions about previous thoracic events such as surgery and asthma/COPD, lung function testing and routine laboratory work. CT, MR and/or PET are used to ensure full knowledge of all tumours; size, location and accessibility. The optimal candidate for ablation has small volume disease, with either no or treatable extra-pulmonic disease. Radiofrequency, laser, microwave and cryoablation have all been used successfully in lung ablation. HIFU is reserved for superficial chest wall or pleural-based masses. Regardless of the ablation technology, CT guidance is used to introduce needles into the tumour with the aim of producing complete 3-D coverage of the tumour and a margin. The advent of CT fluoroscopy allows real-time, mm precision in needle deployment. Choice of needle positioning will depend on the geometry of the tumour and the geometry of the thermal effect. Patient positioning The patient should be positioned to allow access to all areas to be treated, for multiple tumours requiring both anterior and posterior intercostal approaches the lateral position is often the best. Needle entry is chosen to avoid vessels and fissures and to minimise the length of aerated lung to be traversed (5). Tumours are heavier than the normal lung parenchyma and will change position with gravity. The retrocardiac tumour that appears easy to treat in the supine position can fall forward to rest on the posterior wall of the heart in the prone position. To a degree the change in the relative position of the tumour can be anticipated, alternatively scans can be performed in the anticipated treatment position to optimise the approach. Choice of anaesthesia General anaesthesia is required for long treatments involving ablation of large or multiple tumours and for the treatment of tumours in painful locations, for example adjacent to the diaphragm or pleural surface. Conscious sedation and local anaesthesia are adequate for small treatments and for parenchymal tumours. Cryoablation is less painful than the other thermal techniques and can be used with conscious sedation in larger tumours or painful locations in patients who are not fit for anaesthesia. Monitoring of thermal ablation During ablation I use the development of a penumbra of ground glass opacification (GGO) around the tumour to define the ablation zone (6). Several studies have shown that the outer 5 mm of the ground glass region contains inflammatory and viable tumour cells so a minimum margin of 5 mm is required in metastatic disease. A larger margin is advocated in primary lung cancer. There is a delay of several minutes between the delivery of heat and the development of the GGO. CT fluoroscopy at 1 minute intervals is used to monitor the ablation process. In areas where a very careful ablation is required, I will treat for a period of time and then wait a few minutes to see the full effect of the GGO before deciding where more treatment is required. Intermittent spiral CT for multiplanar evaluation of the ablation effect is also useful. Choice of thermal device Detailed knowledge of the device used is critical for good ablation. There is substantial variability not only between technologies but also between devices both in the treatment parameters and in the resultant ablation geometry. RF devices Many centres use expandable devices available in various sizes with a manufacturer recommended treatment protocol that variously monitors end temperature or changes in impedance to direct the ablation. Straight electrodes are more versatile than expandable devices and can be deployed into more areas of the lung. Expandable devices are generally not advocated adjacent to the diaphragm, pleura or central structures. Two or 3 straight sequentially activated electrodes are required for larger tumours. MW devices There are several different devices on the market working at different frequencies, different powers, and with no, gas or water cooling. They vary markedly in their efficacy and their usage and it is paramount that the interventional radiologist understands the device he/she is using. For example, the high power Microsulis device can produce very large, tear shaped, areas of ablation in a short time. As a result short treatments of 20 - 30 s are recommended followed by a delay of several minutes to see the treatment effect. The 3.7 cm CoVidien MW device produces a long, narrow ablation and is best used as a multiple applicator treatment when simultaneous activation of two or three antennae can produce very high temperatures and a more spherical ablation. The 2-cm CoVidien antenna also produces a more spherical ablation and is generally used in smaller tumours. Cryoablation For most tumours, multiple cryoprobes are required. The long treatment cycle using a double or triple freeze thaw cycle (7) means that in practice multiple probes are positioned at the start of the treatment and usually a single treatment cycle is performed. This is in sharp contrast to the other thermal techniques which are often reiterative and therefore more versatile. Cryoablation is associated with less intra-procedural and post-procedural pain but with more a longer period of non-specific systemic malaise. There is a higher incidence of haemorrhagic complication and no ability to cauterise therefore I tend to avoid cryoablation in patients with a haemorrhagic tendency. Tract cauterisation Whenever possible the treating needle should be heated prior to removal to minimise the possibility of tumour seeding. Pneumothorax Perhaps surprisingly pneumothorax is not inevitable, in fact, it has a reported incidence of less than 40%. Drain placement will depend on the size, speed, timing of the pneumothorax and the patients underlying pulmonary reserve. If a moderate pneumothorax develops early in a treatment it may be necessary to position a drain and place on mild suction (-1 to -2 kPA) to allow continued needle placement and to finish the treatment. Pneumothorax may develop after removal of the needles so it is worth a repeat check 5 minutes after needle withdrawal. In patients with good respiratory reserve, I place drains for pneumothoraces >30-40%. Repeat chest X-rays are performed at 4 hours. Most pneumothoraces resolve after a short period of intercostal drainage and the majority of patients are discharged on day 1. Occasionally low level suction is required. Prolonged air leak is unusual and is mostly seen in patients with emphysema/COPD and/or when a large ablation has been performed across a fissure. There is a small incidence of delayed pneumothorax post-ablation so I recommend a repeat chest X-ray 7 days post-procedure in all patients. Infection The ablation cavity can become infected even several months after the procedure. This is particularly true if there is communication to a bronchus (a cavitating ablation zone) and when patients have underlying lung disease and recurrent chest infections. Prompt introduction of oral antibiotics usually resolves the situation without recourse to drainage but infected cavitating ablation zones, as with other c vitating lesions in the lung (aspergilloma/TB), can result in haemoptysis secondary to recruitment of the bronchial arterial circulation. In this situation haemoptysis can be massive (>500 ml) and potentially fatal. Small volume haemoptysis is common in the first few days post-ablation, but if delayed, fresh haemoptysis occurs, particularly if associated with evidence of infection, CT angiography for evaluation of the ablation zone and the bronchial/intercostal circulation with a view to prompt arterial embolisation are required. Neural Injury Phrenic, recurrent laryngeal, sympathetic chain and brachial plexus injury have all been described post-ablation (8). Knowledge of the neural anatomy is required and it is necessary to ensure that these structures are protected from thermal injury or the ablation should not be performed. Post-ablation The ablated zone becomes homogenous over the first few weeks, sometimes starting with the development of a contiguous outer rim. A smooth, thin, enhancing rim of granulation tissue is common in the first few weeks. Subsequently, the dead ablated tissue shrinks/ stabilises and may reduce to a linear scar. Tumour recurrence is readily identified as solid, nodular enlargement of the ablation zone, or a change in the shape of the ablation zone secondary to growth in one area. Careful comparison to previous imaging looking for interval change allows the early diagnosis of recurrence and repeat ablation. Communication to a bronchus will result in cavitation. Infection can be identified by enlargement of the ablation zone which often fills with fluid and gas bubbles and the development of a smooth, enhancing outer rim. There may be oedema in the surrounding parenchyma.",English,0

Results for RFA in large series of patients with liver metastases from colon cancer are very promising. Five-year survival rates of 26% from the time of first ablation and 30% from the diagnosis of liver metastases for patients with limited (<6, <5 cm) liver disease who are not surgical candidates compares well with post resection series where 5-year survival rates vary between 29% and 39% in operable candidates.

Journal Article,F. Gleeson,2013,Lung cancer follow-up,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.12119,"Although lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world, with 1.6 million cases diagnosed in the world in 2008, predicted to increase to 2.2 million cases in 2020, there is a paucity of evidence on the use of imaging following treatment by either surgery or radical radiotherapy for attempted cure. Until recently, published guidelines suggested that there was little benefit to imaging over clinical history and examination in detecting recurrence, and that this plus a CXR was sufficient. The failure to consider that there was a benefit in early recurrence detection may in part be due to the perceived lack of benefit in retreatment. A recently published systematic review and meta-analysis of overall survival and quality of life suggested that active monitoring by imaging demonstrated a non-significant trend for improved survival, and that asymptomatic recurrence detected by imaging may improve survival. More recently guidelines published guidelines suggest active surveillance by CT may be of benefit and may lead to improved quality of life if relapse is treated early and aggressively. There is evidence that the majority of relapse occurs within 24 months, and that there are different patterns of relapse dependent upon the stage at presentation, histological cell type and the treatment performed. Alongside conventional surgical techniques performed for cure, there are now alternative treatments such as Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT), and percutaneous ablation - either radiofrequency or microwave. These new techniques produce characteristic appearances on follow-up imaging post treatment, and it is important to be aware of the different appearances to enable disease recurrence detection. The advent of new therapies and the refinement of surgical techniques has also increased the possibility of retreatment for cure, and there is some published evidence to suggest this is both possible and potentially of benefit. The increased use of screening for lung cancer and the detection of incidental early stage cancers following chest CT scanning performed for non-staging reasons may also alter the numbers of patients undergoing follow up and further increase the benefit in active surveillance post radical treatment.",English,0

A case series review,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.12223,"Objectives: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer related mortality in the western world. For local disease, the standard treatment is surgical resection; however, at least 20% of patients are unable to have surgery due to medical comorbidities. Current practice for non operable, early stage, non-small cell lung cancer involves external beam radiotherapy. A significant number of patients who undergo radiotherapy develop tumour recurrence and have relatively low 5 yr survival rates of 10-30%. Traditionally, patients who had tumour recurrence had limited treatment options consisting of chemotherapy or other methods of palliation. The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate survival, local tumour regression and complication rates for percutaneous CT guided thermal ablation (radiofrequency or microwave ablation) performed on patients for tumour recurrence post external beam radiotherapy at a tertiary cancer hospital. Materials & Methods: Between 2008 and 2012, seven patients were selected for thermal ablation who had previously been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer and which was initially treated with external beam radiotherapy. At the time of presentation for thermal ablation they had local tumour recurrence or new limited intra-pulmonary metastatic disease and were not deemed suitable for further radiotherapy or surgery after discussion at the pulmonary malignancy MDT meeting. Clinical outcomes were determined on the basis of review of medical records, follow up imaging and any biopsy proved residual or recurrent disease (if available). The primary outcomes of survival and time to tumour recurrence post ablation were analysed using the Kaplan- Meier method, which enabled construction of survival and disease recurrence curves. Results: The overall 1, 2 and 3 year survival rates [ ], [ ] and [ ]%. Four out of seven patients developed tumour recurrence following the initial ablation necessitating a second ablation. Of the four lesions that received a second ablation, no recurrence was seen. The local tumour progression free rates at 1 and 2 years were [ ] % and [ ]%respectively. The overall pneumothorax rate was [ ]% ( three out of eleven ablation sessions), chest tube insertion rate was [ ] % (one out of eleven ablation sessions). Conclusions: Both radiofrequency and microwave ablation yield encouraging results in patients with medically inoperable early stage lung cancer who have undergone external beam radiotherapy and who subsequently develop local tumour recurrence or limited metastatic disease.",English,0

BACKGROUND:: Although many hepatobiliary centers have adopted MWA, the factors that influence local control are not well described. METHODS:: Consecutive patients with hepatic malignancy treated by MWA were included from 4 high-volume institutions (2003-2011) and grouped by histology: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal liver metastases, neuroendocrine liver metastases, and other cancers. Independent significance of outcome variables was established with logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS:: Four hundred fifty patients were treated with 473 procedures (139 HCC, 198 colorectal liver metastases, 61 neuroendocrine liver metastases, and 75 other) for a total of 875 tumors. Median follow-up was 18 months. Concurrent hepatectomy was performed in 178 patients (38%), and when performed was associated with greater morbidity. Complete ablation was confirmed for 839 of 865 tumors (97.0%) on follow-up cross-sectional imaging (10 were unevaluable). A surgical approach (open, laparoscopic, or percutaneous) had no significant impact on complication rates, recurrence, or survival. The local recurrence rate was 6.0% overall and was highest for HCC (10.1%, P = 0.045) and percutaneously treated lesions (14.1%, P = 0.014). In adjusted models, tumor size 3 cm or more predicted poorer recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.02-2.50, P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS:: In this large data set, patients with 3 cm or more tumors showed a propensity for early recurrence, regardless of histology. Higher rates of local recurrence were noted in HCC patients, which may reflect underlying liver disease. There were no significant differences in morbidity or survival based on the surgical approach; however, local recurrence rates were highest for percutaneously ablated tumors. © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",English,0

Introduction: Percutaneous thermal tumor ablation is a minimally invasive treatment alternative for primary and secondary pulmonary malignancies. Thermal energy sources can be heat (radiofrequency and microwave) or cold-based (cryoablation). To date, radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been the best developed, although continued advances in microwave and cryoablation technologies have led to their increased utilization and investigation with newly emerging technology-specific benefits. The indications for thermal ablation in the thorax as a stand-alone technique or in combination with other therapeutic options include non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in both the medically operable and inoperable patients, reduction or debulking of tumor burden in anticipation of limiting vital structure involvement or enhancing eligibility for later resection, control of limited recurrent and/or metastatic disease, and palliation for pain control. The emergence of more fully realized thermal ablative technologies, in culmination with image-guided, or minimally invasive, approaches offers a valuable alternative, or at a minimum, a useful adjunct to conventional or limited surgical resection. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 157 image guided thermal ablations for thoracic malignancies performed from December 22, 2005 through November 4, 2009. Results: Ninety-six patients underwent 157 image guided thermal ablations. Of the 157 ablations, 52.2 % (82/157) were radiofrequency ablations, 40.1% (63/157) were cryoablations and 7.7% (12/157) were microwave ablations. With regards to the ablated tumor histology, primary non-small cell lung carcinomas comprised 10.8% (17/157) of treated malignancies; recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinomas 8.2% (13/157), metastases from an extrathoracic primary 63.1% (99/157), and recurrent mesothelioma 17.8% (28/157). Technical considerations critical for successful and safer thoracic tumor ablation were identified and catalogued into three main areas: 1) anatomic concerns, 2) procedural techniques, and 3) complication prevention and management. Conclusion: With refinements in techniques and practices before, during, and after the procedure, image-guided percutaneous thermal tumor ablation will continue to flourish as an efficacious and safe stand-alone or complementary therapy for both primary and secondary lung malignancies in standard and high-risk populations.",English,0

Thermal ablation is used in clinical applications mainly for treating heart arrhythmias, benign prostate hyperplasia, and nonoperable liver tumors; there is also increasing application to other organ sites, including the kidney, lung, and brain. Potential benefits of thermal ablation include reduced morbidity and mortality in comparison with standard surgical resection and the ability to treat nonsurgical patients. The purpose of this review is to outline and discuss the engineering principles and biological responses by which thermal ablation techniques can provide elevation of temperature in organs within the human body. Because of the individual problems associated with each type of treatment, a wide range of ablation techniques have evolved including cryoablation as well as ultrasound, radiofrequency (RF), microwave, and laser ablation. Aspects of each ablation technique, including mechanisms of action, equipment required, selection of eligible patients, treatment techniques, and patient outcomes are presented, along with a discussion of limitations of the techniques and future research directions. © 2007 by Begell House, Inc.",English,0

In recent years, a growing body of evidence for modulation of both adaptive and innate immunity, as well as for the induction of danger signals through thermoablation, has emerged. Induced immune responses, however, are mostly weak and not sufficient for the complete eradication of established tumors or durable prevention of disease progression, and combination therapies with immunomodulating drugs are being evaluated with promising results.

Treatment indications have been expanding to include benign tumors as well. Specifically, the most prevalent indications to date have been in the liver (primary and metastatic disease, as well as benign tumors such as hemangiomas and adenomas), kidney (primarily renal cell carcinoma, but also benign tumors such as angiomyolipomas and oncocytomas), lung (primary and metastatic disease), and soft tissue and/or bone (primarily metastatic disease and osteoid osteomas). Each organ system has different underlying tissue characteristics, which can have profound effects on the resulting thermal changes and ablation zone. Understanding these issues is important for optimizing clinical results. In addition, thermal ablation technology has evolved rapidly during the past several decades, with substantial technical and procedural improvements that can help improve clinical outcomes and safety profiles. Staying up to date on these developments is challenging but critical because the physical properties underlying the different ablation modalities and the appropriate use of adjuncts will have a tremendous effect on treatment results.

Microwave (MW) ablation offers several advantages over radiofrequency (RF) ablation that make it well suited for this indication including: faster heating, higher (more lethal) tissue temperatures, improved consistency in different tissue types, and potentially larger ablation zone sizes. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review the results in the first 47 patients with hepatic metastatic disease treated with a highpower, gas-cooled MW device at a single center. Methods: Between December 2010 and December 2013 we treated 83 hepatic metastases (Primary: 31 colon, 14 carcinoid, 11 melanoma, 8 sarcoma, 4 breast cancer, 3 renal cell carcinoma, 6 neuroendocrine tumor, 2 ovarian cancer and 1 each endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor and squamous cell carcinoma from lung) in 47 patients via a percutaneous approach utilizing US and/or CT guidance. There were 30 male and 17 female patients with mean age of 61 years (range 35-84). All procedures were performed with a high-powered, gas-cooled microwave system (Certus 140, Neuwave Medical, Madison, WI) utilizing 1-3 (average 2.3 +/- 0.7) 17- gauge antennas. Antenna power and ablation time was determined by the performing physician based on lesion size, location, and monitoring findings. Follow-up imaging was performed immediately post-ablation and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12, 18, 24, 36 months with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Results: Tumors ranged in size from 0.5 to 6.0 cm (mean 2.2 cm). Mean imaging follow- up was 12.6 months and median imaging follow up was 11.9 months. Mean clinical follow up was 13.8 months. All treatments were considered technically successful with no evidence of residual tumor at immediate post-procedure CECT. Local tumor progression occurred in 9.6% of tumors (8/83), with a rate of 60% (3/5) for lesions > 4 cm, 9.1% for tumors between 3 and 4 cm (1/11) and 5.9% (4/67) for tumors <3 cm. All but one patient with LTP had either synchronous systemic metastatic disease or other sites of disease already known at the time of the ablation, and thus, only 1 was re-treated (successfully). Two major complications were reported (4.2%): pulmonary embolus two days post-procedure (successfully treated with anticoagulation) and a pleural effusion within one week of the procedure (requiring thoracentesis x 2). No minor complications other than post-procedural pain were encountered. There were no procedure related mortalities. Four patients have died of progressive metastatic disease giving an overall survival of 91.5%, at a mean f/u of 13.8 months. 34% (16/47) of patients have no evidence of disease with a mean follow up in those patients of 10.2 months. Note that 14.9% (7/47) of patients were treated with palliative intent and had other sites of known disease at the time of the ablation, meaning that 40% (16/40) of patients treated with curative intent remain without evidence of disease. Both intrahepatic and systemic metastatic disease were common patterns of failure of therapy. Mean power was 75 W (range, 25-140 W) and mean ablation time was 6.3 minutes (range, 1-19 minutes). Conclusions: A 3 year experience treating hepatic metastases with a high-powered, gas-cooled microwave ablation system shows that MW is safe and effective with local control rates and patient survival that is comparable to, and potentially even slightly better than other ablation modalities. Continued study is warranted to determine efficacy and survival with longer-term follow-up.",English,0

I will discuss a number of interventions including percutaneous biopsy for solid tumor and hematological malignancy diagnosis or recurrence, for the diagnosis of graft versus host disease after stem cell or bone marrow transplantation, and for the diagnosis of complications of immunosuppression such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. In the past, tumor localization techniques have been necessary to biopsy or resect small lesions. However improved guidance techniques have allowed for more precise biopsy and the use of thermal ablation instead of excision for local tumor control. A percutaneously placed radio frequency, microwave, laser or cryogen probe can ablate the primary and metastatic tumors of the liver, lung, bone, kidney and other structures in children. This is an alternative treatment for the local control of tumors that may not be amenable to surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

[German]",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00117-011-2208-9,"CLINICAL ISSUE: The majority of patients with hepatic malignancies are not amenable to surgical resection. In some of these cases minimally invasive ablative therapies are a treatment option. STANDARD TREATMENT: Besides radiofrequency ablation, the most common ablative therapies are cryoablation, laser ablation and microwave ablation. TREATMENT INNOVATIONS: The classic fields of application of microwave ablation are the treatment of malignancies of the liver, kidneys and lungs. Furthermore, cases of treatment of bone tumors and tumors of the adrenal gland have been reported as well as treatment of secondary hypersplenism. PERFORMANCE: The manufacturers of microwave systems pursue different strategies to reach an optimal ablation zone, such as water or gas cooling of the antenna, the simultaneous use of different antennas or an automatic modulation of the microwave energy and frequency. ACHIEVEMENTS: In contrast to other tumor ablation methods microwave ablation causes a direct heating of a tissue volume, thus this method is less vulnerable to the cooling effect of vessels in the ablation zone. Moreover the electric conductivity of the treated tissue does not influence microwave radiation so that microwave ablation has advantages for the treatment of high-resistance organs, such as the lungs or bone. Some publications have shown that microwave ablation causes larger ablation zones in less time in comparison to radiofrequency ablation. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Classic indications for microwave ablation are the treatment of malignancies of the liver, lungs and kidneys. Initial technical problems have been solved, so that an increasing significance of the microwave ablation among the ablative therapies is to be expected.",German,0

Materials: This retrospective study analysed 312 consecutive ablation sessions for lung metastases in 256 patients from November 2000 to July 2015 in (705 lung metastases, 124 women and 188 men; mean age at ablation: 64 years). Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was used in 89.7%, and microwave ablation (MWA) in 10.3%. Results: The incidence of a pneumothorax was 58.7% (183/ 312), with 55.2% of these cases requiring an intercostal drain (101/183). The incidence of a pleural effusion, overnight pain, fever, pneumonia was 22.1%, 10.9%, 6.7% and 4.8%, respectively. For pneumothorax, risk factors included the ablation of >2 pulmonary lesions (OR: 30.5, p<0.001), patients aged 60 years or younger (OR: 6.6, p=0.01), no previous pulmonary ablation (OR: 5.74, p=0.017), lower weight (74 vs 81kg, p=0.03), lower body mass index (BMI) (26 vs 30, p=0.001), and a history of pneumothoraxes post- ablation (OR: 10.07, p=0.001). For intercostal tube placement for pneumothorax, risk factors included ablation of > 2 pulmonary lesions (OR: 12.87, p< 0.001), aged 60 years or younger (OR: 4.51, p=0.034), a history ofchest drain for pneumothorax in a previous ablation (OR: 16.08, p< 0.001), a longer ablation time (43.8 vs 58.7 minutes, p< 0.001), and the use of MWA rather than RFA (OR: 4.08, p=0.049).

Forty-seven patients, in whom extrahepatic metastasis developed after hepatic resection or microwave coagulation therapy (MCT) for primary HCC, were enrolled in this study. Metastatic organs were lung (38 cases), bone (10 cases), brain (6 cases), adrenal gland (3 cases), and lymph nodes (9 cases), including duplicated cases. Twenty eight patients were treated with surgical resection, anticancer chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy for the extrahepatic metastasis (the treatment group). Nineteen patients were in no treatment except symptomatic therapy (the non-treatment group). The 1- and 3-year survival rates after development of extrahepatic metastasis in the treatment group were 42.3% and 17.8%, respectively. No patients in the non-treatment group survived more than 2 years. There was a significant difference between the treatment and the non-treatment group (p=0.0021) with regard to survival rate. Univariate analysis of the treatment group showed the following factors to be significant for survival: 1) intrahepatic lesion(s) was cleared or well controlled by some type of treatment, 2) the treatment for extrahepatic metastasis was effective, 3) extrahepatic metastasis was recognized in Grade A of Child-Pugh classification.

Here, current evidence is reviewed and clinical cases are illustrated to show that slow-growing lung cancer is a real clinical entity, and the reasons why management protocols developed in the screening setting may also be useful in clinical practice are discussed. Features suggesting that a lung cancer may be slow-growing are described and appraised, areas of uncertainty are examined, modern management options for early-stage disease are evaluated and the influence that all this knowledge might have on our clinical decision-making is weighed.

Tumor ablation can be achieved by cryo, radio-frequency, laser, microwave, ultrasound, electro-hyperthermia, radiation, electric currents, or photodynamic based treatments. Ablative techniques provide in situ potential tumor antigens and damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) for the induction of anti-tumor immunity, which will destroy residual malignant cells in primary tumors and distant metastases. In this way, the tumor can serve as its own antigenic vaccine after ablation. Our team developed unique potent tumor ablation techniques, Pulsed Electric Current-Ablation (PECTA) and Diffusing alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy (DaRT), which can destroy the primary tumors. The first treatment, Pulsed Electric Current Tumor Ablation (PECTA) is applied through electrodes, which are inserted into the tumor and deliver unipolar-pulsed electric currents. As a result, toxic low and high pH areas are formed around the anode and cathode, respectively, and kill the tumor cells. The extent of tumor destruction is in a direct correlation with the coulomb amount delivered to the tumor, and treatment with 100 coulomb per cm<sup>3</sup> tumor, was found to eliminate the primary tumor in 100% of the mice with breast or colon derived tumors. The second treatment, Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy (DaRT), is based on insertion of <sup>224</sup>Ra-loaded wire(s) (5-10 mm long; 40 KBq/50 mm<sup>3</sup> tissue) into the tumor. The <sup>224</sup>Ra (3.6 days half life) does not leak from the wire but its daughter atoms penetrate into the tumor by recoil. These shortlived alpha-emitting atoms (with a half life of about 12 h) spread in the tumor and release lethal alpha particles, which cause damage to the malignant cells mainly by DNA double strand breaks. In this study, we explored new approaches to achieve a better local control of tumors by our ablation treatments and facilitate systemic control by combining tumor ablation with immunostimulation and neutralization of immunosuppressive cells. These treatments effectively destroyed malignant experimental animal and human solid tumors such as melanoma, breast, colon, prostate, pancreas, lung, and squamous cell carcinomas. Ablation of primary antigenic tumors by either PECTA or DaRT, released tumor derived antigenic material that provoked T cell dependent anti-tumor immunological reactions. These immune reactions conferred protection against a secondary tumor challenge, and destroyed remaining malignant cells in the primary tumor as well as in distant metastases. Such antitumor immune responses could be further amplified by the use of microbial derived immune adjuvants such as CpG. Inhibition of regulatory T cells with low dose cyclophosphamide or of myeloid derived suppressor cells using sildenafil also augmented the anti-tumor response. PECTA or DaRT together with chemotherapy and immuno-stimulatory agents, can serve as treatment protocols for solid metastatic tumors, and can be applied instead of or in combination with surgery.",English,0

RFA is a low-cost, minimally invasive treatment that has recently attracted attention for treating tumors in different solid organs with promising results [Dupuy and Goldberg, J Vasc Interv Radiol 12:1135-1148, 2001; Friedman et al., Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol 27:427-434, 2004].

Patients with lung malignancies (primary lung cancer or pulmonary metastases), who cannot be operated, might be candidates for RFA treatment. It can also be used in association with other treatments (i.e., chemotherapy, radiotherapy) for better disease control. Combination of the above with RFA may help reduce morbidity and mortality. Many ways to apply energy to the tumor exist (monopolar and bipolar RFA, microwave, laser, brachytherapy).

To discuss indications of interventional treatments in breast liver metastases 2. To comment results of interventional therapies in comparison with other treatments 3. To analyse the role of interventional therapies in the management of breast cancer Breast cancer commonly metastasizes to the bones, lungs, and liver, at which point the cancer is considered a systemic disease and is associated with a poor prognosis. Importantly, liver metastases are present in the majority of patients; however, metastatic disease is confined to the liver in only 5%-18% of patients (1-3). Although a variety of chemotherapy regimens have been tried, median overall survival time for patients with metastatic breast cancer involving only the liver, regardless of the degree of hepatic involvement, is 22-27 months (4-7). Given the poor survival rates associated with the current treatments, there is increasing interest in the use of local therapies in conjunction with systemic therapy to improve the prognosis of patients with liver metastases from breast cancer. To treat hepatic metastases from breast cancer, local ablative techniques such as ultrasonography (US)- or computed-tomography (CT)-guided radiofrequency (RFA) ablation, highintensity-focused ultrasound (HIFU), microwave coagulation (MWC), laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) and cryablation had been used. Common inclusion criteria for liver metastasis ablation had been: fewer than five tumors, maximum tumor diameter of 5 cm or smaller, and disease either confined to the liver or stable with medical therapy. Patients usually had previously undergone chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or both, often show no response or an incomplete response to the treatment. Radiofrequency ablation So far, the effectiveness of RF ablation in the treatment of primary liver tumors and unresectable colorectal liver metastases is well established (8-13, 25-28). Several studies have shown that percutaneous RF ablation is safe and effective in the treatment of liver metastases from breast cancer (12,13, 20). Meloni et al reported complete tumor necrosis in 97% of tumors. Minor complications occurred in only 2 (4%) cases. Median time to follow-up from diagnosis of liver metastasis and from RFA was 37.2 and 19.1 months, respectively. Local tumor progression occurred in 25% of patients. New intrahepatic metastases developed in 53% of patients. From the time of first RF ablation, overall median survival time and 5-year survival rate were 29.9 months and 27%, respectively. From the time the first liver metastasis was diagnosed, overall median survival time was 42 months, and the 5-year survival rate was 32%. Patients with tumors 2.5 cm in diameter or larger had a worse prognosis (hazard ratio, 2.1). Laser thermotherapy To date, the largest study on the use of ablative therapies to treat breast cancer metastases was preformed by Mack et al (28), who treated 578 liver metastases from breast cancer in 232 female patients with magnetic resonance (MR)-guided laser thermotherapy. Mack et al achieved 3- and 5-year survival rates of 66% and 38%, respectively, from the time of treatment, with 1.5% of patients experiencing clinically relevant complications. In the subset of patients eligible for surgery, Mack et al reported a median survival time of 3.7 years from the diagnosis of the MR-guided laser thermotherapy-treated metastasis. MR-guided ablative therapy, however, is more expensive than RF ablation with CT and/or US guidance, both of which are more readily accessible than open interventional MR imagers and do not require non-ferromagnetic ablation devices. Microwave ablation Microwave ablation has also been used to treat breast cancer liver metastases. Abe et al (15) assessed the feasibility and efficacy of using MR-guided microwave thermocoagulation therapy in eight patients with liver metastasis from breast cancer, including patients that had bone metastases, lung metastases, or both at enrollment. At the end of the study, after a mean observation period of 25.9 months, five (62%) of the eight patients were alive, and all of them had new metastases. No procedure-related deaths or major complications were encountered. While Abe et al, however, found that MR-guided microwave ablation appeared to be a safe and feasible method for use in these patients, but more experience is needed. High-intensity-focused Ultrasound HIFU remains the only technique that is completely extracorporeal without percutaneous access (16-19). It does not require insertion of a needle into the target area, and damage of the tissue is obtained by the thermal effect and cavitation, which is caused by US energy. Acoustic energy is absorbed, and heat is generated by delivering high-acoustic intensity to the tissue. Because it is highly focused, acoustic intensity is high only within the focal region; however, outside the focal region the intensity is substantially lower, thus minimizing the risk of unintended injury to the surrounding structures. Unlike RFA, HIFU is completely noninvasive and can be used to reach tumors deep within the body, as in this case, provided there is an acoustic window to allow the transmission of US energy. The limitations of this method is the fact that in most cases general anesthesia is required, that the ablation may not be radical, and that we still do not know the long-term results of this procedure. Surgical resection The results of several studies have shown prolonged survival in certain patients after curative resection (median survival time, 15-63 months) (20-24). Inclusion criteria are generally restricted to the absence of extra-hepatic disease or complete response of extrahepatic metastases (usually bone metastases) to systemic therapy, no brain metastases, normal performance status and liver function test results, and the possibility to perform curative resection. The only significant factor identified was the time between primary breast surgery and the diagnosis of liver metastases, with a shorter interval being associated with a worse prognosis. However, the authors of a more recent series did not confirm this result (21). In many surgical series (20), there was a high rate of new hepatic metastases during follow-up that ranged from 59% (50 of 85 patients) to 67% (12 of 18 patients) and was comparable to results (53%) published by Meloni et al in 2009 (20) and expected, given the natural history of the disease. Adam et al (21) found that survival was worse when margins were macroscopically positive or small-volume disease remained in the remnant liver after resection. Adam et al concluded that surgery should be offered in combination with systemic therapy only to those patients with macroscopically resectable hepatic metastases. When compared with surgical resection, RF ablation is less invasive, less expensive, and has fewer contraindications. Moreover, since many patients will develop liver metastases after surgery, the testof- time approach, which has already been proposed for colon cancer liver metastases, could be used in patients with breast cancer liver metastases. This approach would help avoid unnecessary surgery in patients who would develop new metastases. The results of current available studies demonstrate that RF ablation can be used successfully in selected patients with liver metastases from breast cancer who have disease confined to the liver or who have stable extrahepatic disease to obtain local control of the disease. The local tumor progression rate (25%) was not negligible, and the number of patients who developed new intrahepatic tumors was high (53%); however, both findings were expected, given the natural course of the disease. The improved survival of patients in patients treated by RFA is likely due to the fact that RF ablation can be repeated if patients develop local tumor progression or new tumors. In addition, no treatment- related deaths or major complications were encountered, and the minor complication rate was 4%. Thus, RF ablation should be considered a first-line therapy with which to achieve local control in patients with metastatic breast cancer conf ned to the liver and in patients whose extrahepatic disease is stable with systemic chemotherapy. In conclusion, current results show that survival rates for percutaneous thermal ablation in selected patients with breast cancer liver metastases, and those with disease confined to the liver or with stable extrahepatic metastases, are comparable to those obtained with surgery or laser ablation. Importantly, RF ablation is a safe technique that can be repeated if new hepatic metastases appear.",English,0

This technique allows for flexible approach to treatment in patients with localized lung cancer who are non surgical candidates. . CASE PRESENTATION: 63 year old male with known history of COPD underwent a CT Chest showing a spiculated nodular opacity in the RUL measuring approx 13 x 8 mm. Subsequent PET Scan showed nodule with increased hypermetabolic activity with SUV of 1.7. He underwent CT guided biopsy of the nodule twice with cytology showing absence of malignant cells.The second biopsy attempt showed atypical cells. He was referred to thoracic oncology with recommendations to undergo thoracoscopic wedge resection of the RUL lung nodule for diagnostic purposes. Histology confirmed Adenocarcinoma. Follow up PET scan in a year showed recurrence of local disease. The area increased in size measuring 11x 9 mm with an SUV of 2.1. He was referred to IR for microwave ablation. He underwent a follow up CT scan showing a well marginated cavitary mass in the right lung area of recent ablation. Patient was seen at urgent care facility twice for shortness of breath and was treated with antimicrobial therapy based on his CXR and CT scan findings. He was seen as a follow up in the pulmonary clinic and had no complains of fevers , chills, or productive cough. Increased airspace density involving the right upper lung at the site of the patient's ablation was thought to be mistaken for an infectious etiology DISCUSSION: Follow up imaging after and during follow up is necessary to measure the success of thermal ablation. Cavitation can occur in 25% of the lesions. At 1 week to 1 month post ablation the lesion appears as an area of consolidation or nodules. Cavitation at the ablation site can be mistaken for an infectious process. Risk factors include aspiration or steroid treatment. Infection should be considered when follow up imaging shows cavity wall thickening or non focal hypermetabolic activity on the scan. CONCLUSIONS: Image guided microwave ablation is an exciting science . Presently microwave ablation is best for early stage lung cancers. Cavitation of lung neoplasm following ablation occurs commonly. Awareness along with associated clinical picture can prevent unnecessary usage of antimicrobial therapy.",English,0

Some patients with inoperable disease have small-volume lung metastases that are amenable to thermal ablation. We report our results after radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients treated from 2007 to 2012 in whom the intention was to treat all sites of disease and who had a minimum CT follow-up of 4 months. Treatment was performed under general anesthesia/conscious sedation using cool-tip RFA. Follow-up CT scans were analyzed for local control. Primary tumor type, location, grade, disease-free interval, prior resection/chemotherapy, number and size of lung tumors, uni- or bilateral disease, complications, and overall and progression-free survival were recorded. Results: Twenty-two patients [15 women; median age 48 (range 10-78) years] with 55 lung metastases were treated in 30 sessions. Mean and median tumor size and initial number were 0.9 cm and 0.7 (range 0.5-2) cm, and 2.5 and 1 (1-7) respectively. Median CT and clinical follow-up were 12 (4-54) and 20 (8-63) months, respectively. Primary local control rate was 52 of 55 (95 %). There were 2 of 30 (6.6 %) Common Terminology Criteria grade 3 complications with no long-term sequelae. Mean (median not reached) and 2- and 3-year overall survival were 51 months, and 94 and 85 %.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography-guided MW ablation of the lung was performed in 8 swine under general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. The orientation of the 17-gauge probe was either perpendicular (90 degrees ) or parallel (< 30 degrees ) with respect to the pleural puncture site, and the ablation power was 30 W or 65 W for 5 minutes. After MW ablation, swine were euthanized, and histopathologic changes were assessed. Frequency and factors affecting pneumothorax were evaluated by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Among 62 lung MW ablations, 13 (21%) pneumothoraces occurred. No statistically significant difference was noted in the rate of pneumothorax between the perpendicular and the parallel orientations of the probe (31% vs 14%; odds ratio [OR], 2.8; P = .11). The pneumothorax rate was equal for 65-W and 30-W ablation powers (21% and 21%; OR, 1.0; P = .94). Under multivariate analysis, 2 factors were independent positive predictors of pneumothorax: ablation zone inclusive of pleural insertion point (OR, 7.7; P = .02) and time since intubation (hours) (OR, 2.7; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Geometries where the pleural puncture site excluded the ablation zone decreased pneumothorax in swine undergoing MW ablation in the lung.

However, it sometimes is challenging to resect a juxtaarticular osteosarcoma in a way that preserves the affected epiphysis because wide margins are necessary to minimize the risk of local recurrence. If there was a method to resect a tumor close to the joint and treat a potentially positive margin to prevent recurrence, it might allow salvage of a joint that otherwise might be lost. Questions/purposes: We therefore asked (1) whether joint-preserving tumor resection could be performed for juxtaarticular osteosarcoma after microwave ablation of the tumor edge under navigation without leading to local recurrences, (2) what is the resulting function, and (3) what are the complications associated with this procedure. Methods: Between 2009 and 2011, we treated 11 patients who had juxtaarticular osteosarcoma of the proximal tibia (mean age, 12 years; range, 9-16 years) with joint-preserving surgery by transepiphysis tumor resection after navigation-assisted microwave ablation of the tumor edge; they were followed a minimum of 37 months (mean, 48 months; range 37-62 months), and none was lost to followup. Patients were considered eligible for this procedure if they had a distance from the tumor edge to the articular surface between 10 to 15 mm, good chemotherapy responses, no pathologic fracture and no tumor involvement of major neurovascular structures. Allograft in combination with a vascularized fibula flap was used for segmental reconstruction. We recorded local tumor control, complications, and functional outcomes using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better function. Results: There were no local recurrences. Major complications included osteonecrosis of part of the epiphysis in two patients and deep infection in one. The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score ranged from 26 to 30 with a mean of 29. Conclusions: In selected patients with osteosarcoma invading the epiphysis, navigated resection facilitates performing joint-sparing surgery, and in our small series, the adjuvant microwave ablation seemed to provide adequate local tumor control. Although more experience and longer followup are needed, this approach may make it possible to salvage more native joints when performing limb salvage for osteosarcoma.

The authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous microwave ablation of adrenal malignant tumors. METHODS: Nine patients between 41 and 83 years of age (average age, 54 years) with adrenal carcinoma (a total of 10 lesions) received CT-guided percutaneous water-cooled microwave ablation. The 9 cases included 1 primary adrenocortical carcinoma and 8 metastatic carcinomas (4 from lung cancer, 2 from hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 from left tibial osteosarcoma). Of the 8 metastatic cases, 7 were unilateral, and 1 was bilateral. All cases were pathologically confirmed by aspiration biopsy or postsurgical biopsy. The tumor diameters ranged from 2.1 cm to 6.1 cm (average, 3.8 cm). The average number of ablation sites was 1.5 sites (1-3 sites), and the average accumulated ablation time was 7.7 minutes (4-15 minutes). The procedures were performed using a cooled-shaft antenna. RESULTS: The patients were followed for 3-37 months, with an average of 11.3 months. Nine of 10 lesions were completely necrotized after first treatment. The other lesion was completely necrotized after 2 treatments. One of the patients experienced hypertensive crisis during treatment. No patient experienced recurrent tumor at the treated site, and this lack of recurrence indicated effective local control. All patients had progression of metastatic disease at extra-adrenal sites.

Materials/Methods Between July 2010 and July 2012, 28 patients, 14 female, mean age 61 years (31-87) with 54 pulmonary malignancies of mean diameter 18 mm (6-59mm) underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided thermal ablation (radio-frequency ablation for two lesions, microwave ablation for the remainder). Bronchogenic carcinoma was treated in 15 patients, metastatic tumour in the remainder (tumours were diagnosed by biopsy (67%) and or PET/CT). Technical success was defined as needle placement in the intended lesion without death or serious injury. Adequacy of ablation was assessed at 24 hours on contrast-enhanced CT. Circumferential solid or ground glass opacification > 4mm was deemed adequate, and >5mm was deemed ideal. Patients were followed with contrast-enhanced CT 3 monthly until death, or local tumour recurrence; Recurrence was identified by enlargement of the zone, the development of contrast enhancement in part of the zone, or a change in the shape of the ablation zone as a result of enlargement of one area. Survival rate was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis Results Thermal ablation was technically successful in 98% (n = 50). Mean ablation duration was 5.2 minutes (1-24 minutes). 19(68%) patients developed a pneumothorax post procedure, 7 (25%) required a chest drain. 30-day mortality rate was 0%. The mean hospital stay was 1.3 days (1-7 days). Local recurrence was only identified in one patient at a median follow up of 12 months. The 1-year survival for all cause mortality was 68%; cancer-specific mortality yielded a 1-year survival of 75%. Conclusions Thermal ablation of pulmonary malignancies is a safe, successful technique. Local control rates and survival analysis are encouraging, with rapid treatment times, performed as a single day-case procedure advantageous over stereotactic beam radiotherapy.",English,0

Materials and Methods: CT and/or CT-US fluoroscopic guided percutaneous cryoablations were performed using established adult parameters of N+1 cryoprobes for N(cm) tumor diameter. One liver procedure was performed with 17ga microwave ablation. Ablation locations were noted as head and neck, thoracic, liver, kidney, soft tissue. Tumor type, complications, and length of stay were recorded. Additionally, lesion volumes were calculated before and after ablation. Complications were graded by the Common Terminology of Complications and Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). Results: Cryoablation was performed on 153 tumors in 62 pediatric and young adults in 107 procedures. All patients received only conscious sedation. An average age of 22.6 (range 1.6-38.6) was observed in the pediatric population. Tumors were noted as follows: 41 Lung, 16 Liver,7 Kidney, 38 Soft Tissue, and 40 Fibroadenoma. Patient mortality was 0%, with all adverse events being mild/moderate except for a single severe adverse event (1%) owing to a bronchopulmonary fistula following lung cryo. Inpatient hospitalization >24 hours was required in 10 of 107 procedures. The one micro- wave procedure produced significant discomfort that was not seen in any cryoablation case. Conclusion: CT guided percutaneous cryoablation is a safe treatment alternative in the pediatric and young adult popula- tion with associated low morbidity, and should be considered in the management of neoplastic disease. Multifocal use of cryoablation is safe for pediatric patients with outcomes similar for adults, also emphasizing its low pain.",English,0

However, it remains problematic with respect to liver metastases. Here, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of thermal ablation in patients with liver metastases. METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with 132 liver metastases measuring 0.8-5.0 cm were treated with microwave ablation (MWA) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The primary lesions were colorectal cancer in 38 cases and others in 51, respectively. Local tumor control, complications, and long-term survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Complete ablation was achieved in 117 of 132 (88.6%) nodules. Seventeen of the 117 (14.5%) successfully treated nodules developed local recurrence. In a univariate analysis, a significant trend toward a lower local recurrence rate with MWA was observed (8.6% for MWA vs. 20.3% for RFA, P=0.072). Multivariate analysis showed that number of cycles of chemotherapy was the significant prognostic factor for overall recurrence (P=0.015), whereas disease-free interval was the significant prognostic factor for distant recurrence (P=0.030). Ablation modality showed potential prognostic significance for local recurrence (P=0.053). Major complications occurred in 1.1% of patients. No procedure-related mortalities were observed. The 1, 2, 3, and 5-year overall survival rates after the initial ablation were 84.9, 59.6, 48.8, and 36.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Thermal ablation is a safe and effective treatment for patients with liver metastases. MWA has the potential to result in less local recurrence than RFA.

Hepatic resection and liver transplantation are considered optimal for potential treatment of HCC. However, only 20% of HCCs can be surgically treated. And most of surgically-noneligible patients have to receive locoregional image-guided interventional managements including intra-arterial and percutaneous ablative therapies. In this paper, we review these interventional approaches. Catheter-based therapies include embolotherapy/chemotherapy-based treatments (such as transarterial chemoembolization, bland embolization, transcatheter arterial chemoinfusion, and chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads), and radiotherapy-based treatments (such as radioembolization with yttrium-90 and injection of iodine-131-labeled lipiodol). Ablative therapeutic approaches include chemical therapies (such as ethanol or acetic acid injection), and thermal therapies (such as radiofrequency ablation, laser induced thermotherapy, microwave ablation, cryoablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation). Each method has its advantages and drawbacks. As a result of the technical development of locoregional approaches for HCC during the recent decades, the range of combined interventional therapies has been continuously extended. In this article, an evidence-based approach is used to review the current role of interventional radiology in the management of unresectable HCC.",English,0

However, as they rely mainly on thermal energy, such as radiofrequency or microwave, many tumors close to sensitive organs, such as ducts, bowel, and nerves, still remain nonablatable owing to the risk of thermal injury. Irreversible electroporation is a novel ablation modality that relies largely on a nonthermal mechanism to induce cell death, and therefore may overcome many of the shortcomings of thermal ablation. Emerging preclinical data as well as early clinical experience is showing promise for this technique in treating a variety of tumors including periportal liver masses, pancreatic cancer, perihilar renal tumors, prostate cancer, and other soft tissue tumors. However, practical limitations remain for irreversible electroporation, and its complete cancer and location-specific safety and efficacy profiles are still largely unknown. We therefore review what is known for this new ablation modality based on preclinical and preliminary clinical data, and discuss its emerging indications as well as technical challenges. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",English,0

Radiofrequency ablation has been successfully used in the past. Microwave ablation (MWA), offers theoretical advantages over traditional methods of thermal ablation, unstudied in this setting. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of MWA in the local control of colorectal pulmonary metastases at 12 month follow-up. Methods: Retrospective data was collected on all patients undergoingMWA for colorectal pulmonary metastases at a single institution with at least 12 months follow-up. Adverse events within 30 days of MWA were considered procedure-related complications. CT imaging performed immediately prior to MWA was compared with routine progress CTs at 3, 6 and 12 months. Efficacy was measured using modified-RECIST criteria, 12 month progression-free survival and mortality. Results: Eight patients (n = 8) had ten metastases treated with MWA. Median age was 74 (range 56-82) and five were men. Complications included small pneumothoraces requiring no treatment (2/8) and minor haemorrhage requiring no treatment (4/8). One patient required a 14 day admission for management of pulmonary oedema, chest pain and reduced mobility. The other seven patients required 24 hours of routine observation alone. At 12 month patients demonstrated complete response (1/8), partial response (1/8), stable disease (4/8). Two patients demonstrated disease progression at 5 and 10 month post-MWA requiring repeat MWA. Technical difficulty due to lesion location and significant heat sink effect respectively were found to be contributing factors. The 12 month progression-free survival was 75% (6/8) with no deaths (0/8) at 12 month follow-up. Conclusion: MWA was found to be safe and efficacious in the local control of colorectal pulmonary metastases at 12 month follow-up.

To know about the cost effectiveness of surgery, ablation and SBRT 2. To know about the real costs versus reimbursement of surgery, ablation and SBRT 3. To compare efficacy of ablation, surgery and SBRT The lung is a frequent site of metastatic disease with up to 30% of cancer patients developing lung metastases. The initial treatment in metastatic lung disease commonly entails chemotherapy, which is often considered as the treatment of choice. Despite its early introduction with an initial report in 1882, locoregional therapy such as resection of lung metastases has long been discussed to be controversial. With evolving experience in pulmonary metastasectomy over the last 130 years, the approach to cancer patient with pulmonary metastasis has evolved with an important role in surgery, which is the most traditional locoregional treatment in select cases. In a collective of 5206 cases with lung metastases from various primary tumors, the actuarial survival after metastasectomy was 26% at 10 years [1]. In several indications such as lung metastases from colorectal or germ cell tumors, even better results are achieved [2]. At present, the management of lung metastases is a multifaceted topic with various local treatment options. For selected patients, typically high-risk patients unfit for surgery, these options include stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), thermal ablations such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation, transarterial therapy, and investigational approaches such as bronchial artery infusion therapy and transpulmonary chemoembolization [3]. Despite their theoretical appeal, the latter did not show sufficient potential for a broad clinical application. Unfortunately, there is only weak evidence based on retrospective case series indicating survival benefit from locoregional therapies in lung metastases. These data are used to justify the clinical practice, but this practice has never been subjected to randomized controlled trials. In the most recent systematic review on the locoregional treatment of lung metastases from colorectal cancer, only four studies on RFA and 23 surgical series out of 798 publications met the quality criteria for inclusion in this analysis; interestingly, no study on radiosurgery was of sufficient quality. Results were inhomogeneous, with 5-year survival rates ranging from 34.9% to 45% for RFA and from 29% to 71.2% for surgery [2]. Due to the lack of phase III trials, no firm conclusions could be drawn, and the authors called for highquality trials comparing the currently used treatment modalities such as SBRT, RFA, and surgery. Data on the cost effectiveness of locoregional treatments for lung metastases is completely (almost) missing. A case study on activity- based costing in RFA showed the economic value of this therapy from the business point of view [4], while an older cost effectiveness analysis proved the superiority of resection over chemotherapy in patients with lung metastases from soft tissue sarcoma [5]. In contrast, a limited number of studies assessed surgery, stereotactic and conventional radiation therapies, and RFA from a cost-effectiveness perspective [6-8]. In all of these studies, RFA was the least costly treatment; among nonsurgical therapies, it was the most cost-effective treatment strategy for small lesions (T1) in cases in which stereotactic radiation therapy was not available or contraindicated. As metastatic lung disease affects a different group of patients and follows different principles than those followed by primary lung cancer, these data cannot be transferred without interpretation. Nevertheless, thermal ablation may be considered cost effective in elderly patients and in patients not eligible for surgery. Moreover, it is most cost effective from the business point of view. Considering the paucity of data, there is a strong need for cost-effectiveness studies comparing different locoregional treatments for lung metastases.",English,0

Materials and Methods: 108 patients (42 female, 66 male, mean age 73 years) received outpatient CT guided percutaneous microwave ablation for a single lung malignancy. Patient data, including procedural reports, hospital and outpatient oncology clinical records, as well as follow-up contrast enhanced CT and PET scans, were retrospectively reviewed. Kaplan-Meier modelling and logistic regression were used. Results: The odds of success are 11.1 times higher for o3 cm tumor vs >3 cm, 95% CI[2.97,41.1], p=.0003. Tumor type had no effect on technical success. The odds of complication of any kind were 2 times higher for >3cm tumors vs <3cm, though this trended toward significance, p=.09. For every mm increase in original tumor maximal diameter (OMD), the odds of not attaining success increased by 7%, 95% CI[3%,10%], p=.0002. Likewise, for every mm increase in OMD, the odds of one or more complications increased by 3%, 95% CI [.1%,5%], p=.04. The median time for tumor reoccurrence was 62 months, 95% CI [29,na]. Reccurrence was estimated at 22% 36% and 44% for 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively. The median time of cancer-related death was 42 mo, 95% CI[38,na]. In addition, reccurrence was estimated at 31% at 13 mo for tumors >3cm and 17% for those <3cm. Medians could not be estimated due to low event rate for tumors <3cm, only the first quartile was estimated: 24 mo for tumors <3cm and 10 mo for >3cm; this difference trended toward significance, p=.0513. 54% of patients had one or more complications of various severities including: pneumothorax 32%, bronchopleural fistula 2%, hospital admission 28%, pain 20%, infection 7%, postablation syndrome 4%, and ARDS 4%. No relationship was found for pneumothorax with size or cancer type. Conclusion: This study further supports the safe and effective use of outpatient MWA for the treatment of lung malignancies.

Journal Article,G. Mauri; L. Solbiati,2012,How does fusion imaging help IR?,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00270-012-0437-6,"Learning Objectives 1. To present the properties of fusion imaging 2. To describe how the techniques can be applied 3. To show tips and tricks in clinical application In the last years, thermal ablation with radiofrequency, microwaves, cryotherapy, laser, etc. has been validated as an effective treatment for several different kinds of tumors in different body regions. Thermal ablation is actually considered a curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma with results comparable to resection and also as effective local treatment for liver metastases unresponsive to chemotherapy, either as potential alternative to surgical resection or as the only possible curative local treatment for unresectable metastases. More recently, thermal ablation has been successfully used for local control of other abdominal (renal carcinomas, non-functioning adrenal tumors, abdominal sarcomas, etc.) and extra-abdominal malignancies, e.g. lung primary or secondary cancers and bone tumors. An essential prerequisite for the correct use and the success of percutaneous ablation therapies is the availability of precise, reliable imaging techniques for careful pre-procedure planning, accurate intraprocedure targeting and elaborate post-procedure monitoring and assessing of the results achieved. Nowadays several different imaging modalities can be used for the detection and characterisation of malignancies, each one with his peculiar advantage and disadvantage. In diagnostic radiology are well known the great improvement that derived from the ability to combine the advantages of anatomical imaging -such as computed tomography (CT)- with the advantages of functional imaging -such as positron emission tomography (PET). Ultrasound (US) is the most widely diffused imaging technique for guiding percutaneous procedures, as it allows for real time visualization of the needle insertion and monitoring of the procedure, and does not require ionizing radiation. Moreover, US guidance overcomes some of the limitations of other imaging modalities such as CT or magnetic resonance (MRI) that enable visualization of only transverse sections and often the visualization of the tumor only during the arterial and/or portal-venous phase of the dynamic study. However, there is a clinically relevant number of liver malignancies that are not sufficiently visible at US, and can be visualized only with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Successful ablation treatments guided with CT or MRI have been reported. However, compared to US, either CT or MRI suffer from some limitations. The major limitations of CT are the limited or absent real-time capability (so that many procedures are actually blind manoeuvres with subsequent confirmation), the very frequent need for the administration of contrast agents to visualize focal tumor targets due to the insufficient contrast resolution of baseline scans, and the use of ionizing radiation with relevant dose to both the patient and the operators. With MRI the risk of radiation is lacking, the use of contrast agents to visualize targets is rarely mandatory, ablation devices can be placed along freely selected imaging planes and using almost realtime sequences. However, the high cost and limited availability of MRI machines, the need for magnetic ablation devices and the complex procedural environment greatly restrict the use of MRI for the guidance of ablations. The combination of two or more imaging techniques (the so-called fusion imaging"") has been applied in recent years to percutaneous procedures to overcome the limitations of a single imaging modality and combine the advantages of different imaging modalities. The development of systems for real-time image fusion of US and CT or MRI allow to precisely targeting also focal lesions undetectable with US. In our centre we have pioneered this kind of system since 2003, initially using for co-registration tiny metallic fiducial markers applied to the skin and subsequently external markers (xiphoid sternum and umbilicus) to get a first gross registration, and then internal markers to perf rm a fine tuning. The system, nowadays employed in several interventional centres throughout the world, is highly automated, can be used directly in the US interventional room and does not require relevant additional costs. Up to now more than 1,000 (mostly hepatic) malignant tumors have been treated at our institution using fusion imaging with radiofrequency, microwaves or laser ablation. Extremely interesting are the cases of tumors completely undetectable on US, targeted using the ""virtual needle"" provided by the fusion system and totally ""blindly"" for US. In this particularly challenging group, correct targeting was achieved in as many as 211 of the 230 (91.7%) liver tumors enrolled. Additional technical refinements, like automatic registration and microsensors positioned inside the cannula of radiofrequency electrodes or microwaves antennas, will likely further improve the results achievable and increase the diffusion of fusion imaging as guidance modality for interventional procedures.""",English,0

Limited long-term data has been reported to this point of thermal ablative (TA) techniques. Most report series and studies have follow-up in the 1 to 2 year range. We report our mature experience of metastatic cancer patients treated with TA for control of thoracic oligometastasis. Methods: All metastatic patients (pts) consecutively treated between 2004 and 2011 with TA at Wake Forest were reviewed. Pts excluded if treated for local failure after radiotherapy. TA technique varied over time by type and manufacturer. IRB approval was obtained. Radiographic and clinical information was reviewed from records available. Patients were scored regarding to local (at the site treated) or distant failure. Local control from date of procedure to last known imaging. Local control defined be modified RECIST and PET as needed taking into account TA effects. Toxicity graded per NCI CTCAE v4.0. Descriptive statistics used to report toxicity. Kaplan Meir estimation of local control (LC) and overall survival (OS). Unpaired t-test used for comparison. Results: 79 pts were treated during a total of 106 TA procedures to total 117 tumors. 9 pts multiple tumors same day, 5 pts repeat TA for local failure, 8 pts with 3 or more lesions ablated; 22 total pts treated to multiple sites or repeat. Median age 65.5 years (18-86). Thermal ablation was radiofrequency 86, cryoablation 24, microwave 7. Average length of stay 1.7 nights (0-12); 11 pts with > 3 night LOS. Anesthesia was general 57, conscious 49. Metastatic tumor subtype by patient: NSCLC 27, colorectal (CRC) 16, renal 11, head and neck 12, other 13. Median fu 20.5m entire cohort (0.2-82) and 29m (2-82) among living pts. Median OS 40m all pts (range 30 months NSCLC to 48m CRC p 0.05). 1 yr, 3 yr, 5 yr OS: 83.9%, 51.5% (95% CI 38.6 - 64.4m), 24.1%. Median OS 26 months single lesion vs not reached multiple lesions (20 pts) p=0.0003. Median tumor size 14 mm (3-68). Local control: 1 yr 92.6%, 2 yr 83.1%, 3 yr 72.4% (95% CI 61.7-83.1), 5 yr 40.9%. 2 year local control <2cm tumor 89.1%, > 2cm tumor 60.2%. LC not different by TA modality. Of 32 local failures, 9 salvaged with RT, 5 repeat TA, 1 surgery. 1 pt with grade 5 toxicity due to TA; 39 pts Grade 2 pneumothorax (PTX), 17 additional pts PTX iatrogenic for procedure; 4 pts grade 2 hemorrhage, 3 pts grade 2 effusion, 2 pts grade 3 empyema. Conclusions: For patients with oligometastatic thoracic disease, thermal ablation is safe and provides durable control for tumors < 2.0 cm with long term follow-up. Survival better in patients with multiple tumors likely due to patient selection bias. Additional prospective studies with long term efficacy endpoints needed. (Figure presented).",English,0

The recent development of high-powered microwave (MW) ablation offers theoretical advantages over existing ablation systems, including higher tissue temperatures, more reproducible ablation zones, and shorter procedural times. The purpose of this study is to review the feasibility, safety, and early efficacy of a novel high-powered percutaneous MW ablation system to treat RCC. Methods: An institutional database identified 53 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven RCC <4 cm (55 tumors) who were treated with percutaneous MW ablation using a novel MW ablation system. All patients had percutaneous renal mass biopsy, which identified RCC before ablation. Postprocedure follow-up imaging was performed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Mean patient age was 66 years and 81% of patients were male. RCC subtypes included clear cell (n=25), papillary (n=12), and unspecified (n=18) and Fuhrman grades 1, 2, 3, and ungraded in 15, 25, 1, and 14 patients, respectively. The mean tumor diameter was 2.6 cm (range 0.8-4.0 cm). Six low-grade complications were recorded during 53 (11.3%) procedures: five Clavien Grade 1 (urine retention, fluid overload, and atrial fibrillation) and one Grade 2 (hemorrhage requiring transfusion). The postprocedure estimated glomerular filtration rate was not significantly changed from preprocedure levels (median:-1.1%, p=0.10). Median follow-up was 8 months (interquartile range [IQR] 5-18.25) with 0/38 (0%) patients demonstrating evidence of local recurrence or metastasis during surveillance imaging. Conclusions: Use of a high-powered MW ablation system for the treatment of T1a RCC is feasible, safe, and efficacious with short-term follow-up.

To report the most appropriate indications for HIFU 2. To illustrate how to enhance success rates 3. To compare results of HIFU to other IR techniques Bone is the third most common organ involved by metastatic disease behind the lung and liver. Bone metastases occur in up to 70% of prostate cancer patients and breast cancer patients. Post-cancer survival has increased with improvement in early detection and treatments. As a consequence, the number of patients developing metastatic bone disease during their lifetime has also increased. Quality of life may be significantly impaired as a consequence of painful bone metastases. Current treatments for patients with bone metastases are primarily palliative and include localized therapies (radiation and surgery), systemic therapies (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiopharmaceutical, and bisphosphonates although the primary goal of the use of these therapies are often to address the disease itself), and analgesics (opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Recently, radiofrequency ablation has been demonstrated as a feasible treatment option for bone metastases. Following large efforts in the field of technological and medical research to significantly reduce the side effects of conventional treatment and to provide additional therapeutic options, several new modalities have been introduced in the last decades, including radiofrequency, laser, microwaves, and cryoablation. Treatment with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is the standard of care for patients with localized bone pain, and results in the palliation of pain for many of these patients. However, 20-30% of patients treated with radiation therapy do not experience pain relief. Re-treatment rates are generally reported in the range of 10-25%. Many patients with relapsed pain or poor response to initial radiation may be lost to follow-up or may not be referred back to oncologists for consideration of re-radiation. In addition to relapse and re-treatment, there is an increased risk of pathologic fracture in the peri-radiation period. The fracture rate reported in radiation studies is generally in the range of 1-8%. Furthermore, patients who have recurrent pain at a previously irradiated site may not be eligible for further radiation therapy secondary to limitations in normal tissue tolerance and increased long-term toxicity. There may also be a greater incidence of acute side effects of nausea and vomiting if the treatment field includes the stomach. A palliative treatment for painful bone metastases that is noninvasive, without long-term toxicity, and has minimal complications would be a useful tool for treating physicians and also a beneficial option for patients suffering from painful bone metastases. More recently, highintensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) techniques have been clinically implemented. The use of focused ultrasound for ablation therapy was first introduced in China in 1980s, with the development of biological focal field in 1997. Following the clinical implementation of HIFU, conventional ultrasound (US) has been widely adopted for ablation guidance with good results: this approach, however, limits treatment to externally targetable lesions and prevents real-time evaluation of procedure success. Magnetic resonance (MR) imagingguided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a newly introduced, noninvasive method for reducing the pain in skeletal metastases, and it offers several key advantages over other noninvasive treatment modalities. MRgFUS enables the performance of three-dimensional treatment planning with MR imaging and continuous temperature mapping of treated tissue by using MR thermometry, thereby enabling real-time monitoring of thermal damage in the target zone. The concentration of acoustic energy on the intact surface of cortical bone produces a rapid temperature increase that mediates critical thermal damage to the adjacent periosteum, the most innervated component of mature bone tissue. Such thermal ablation has been shown to be an extremely effective appr ach for pain management. Target tissue is heated beyond the threshold for protein denaturation (50-60Cdegree) for few seconds, resulting in coagulation necrosis. The absorption rate of ultrasound by cortical bone is up to 50 times higher, compared with other biological tissues, thus allowing only a minimal fraction of the applied energy to penetrate across the cortex. For pain palliation, the concentration of acoustic energy on the intact surface of cortical bone rapidly creates a temperature increase that determines critical thermal damage to the adjacent periosteum; because the periosteum is the highest innervated component of mature bone tissue, its ablation is an extremely effective approach for pain management. MRgFUS ablation is indicated to treat painful bone lesions from metastatic disease in patients with known history of malignancy, as shown by clinical or imaging examinations. In particular, MRgFUS ablation is indicated in patients who are considered radiation failures (those patients who received radiation without adequate symptom relief, those who can no longer undergo external beam radiation therapy for safety reasons, and those who refuse other therapy options). In our department, we have evaluated the safety and efficacy of MRgFUS treatment for pain palliation of lesions from different known primary tumors. Our study was conducted in patients who had exhausted EBRT and also in patients not previously treated with EBRT in target metastases, and it has demonstrated that MRgFUS can be effectively applied as primary noninvasive technique for pain palliation related to bone metastases. In our institution, all MRgFUS procedures, including pretreatment imaging, are performed on a 3-T MR imaging system (Discovery MR 750; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis) combined with the ExAblate MRgFUS system (InSightec, Tirat Carmel, Israel). For the clinical evaluation, data are collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after treatment and thereafter at 30-day intervals for 1 year. Clinical data include an evaluation of a visual analog pain score (VAS), changes in the drug schedule, and improvements in quality of life. VAS is an 11-point pain scale that ranges between 0 and 10, where 0 is no pain at all and 10 is the worst pain. A partial response to treatment is defined as a drop of two points in VAS from the pretreatment baseline, with no increase in pain medication, or a reduction of 25% in pain medication without an increase in the reported pain score. A complete response is defined as a VAS of 0 without an increase in medication. A change in the drug schedule is defined primarily by a decrease in the intake of analgesics or opiates. The improvement in quality of life (as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory Quality of Life questionnaire) is used to assess the impact of pain relief on the key domains of daily living, including physical activity, work, mood, ability to walk, and ability to sleep. This procedure is performed on an outpatient basis and has the potential to be repeated if necessary; moreover, the absence of adverse events suggests this treatment option as a viable alternative to standard pain palliation treatments, including EBRT. In fact, although current guidelines did not find any unacceptable rates of long-term side effects that may limit the use of EBRT in patients with painful bone metastases, EBRT-related acute and long-term side effects can occur in 1.5-3% of cases. None of these toxicity effects, such as skin and gastrointestinal reactions, loss of nerve function or even pathological fractures and bone marrow damage, occurred during MRgFUS treatment. In conclusion MRgFUS ablation is an extremely promising alternative therapy for pain palliation in patients suffering from bone metastases. The major advantages of the technique include its noninvasive nature; the ability to perform three-dimensional MR imaging visualization for precise treatment planning; continuous temperature mapping of treated tissue with MR thermometry, which enables real-time monitoring of thermal damage in the target zone; and immediate post treatment assessment of therapy. The treatment can be performed in a single session, is noninvasive, does not use ionizing radiation, and utilizes MR guidance for precise targeting and thermal control, which confers a high safety profile.",English,0

We report long-term outcomes following thermal ablation from a single center in patients with Stage IA NSCLC. Methods: Medically inoperable patients with Stage IA NSCLC underwent RFA or MWA. Follow-up imaging included serial CT scans every 3 months and PET scans every 6 months for 24 months, and then at reduced frequency. Factors influencing the incidence of local progression (LP) at the ablation site and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Results: From July 2005 through September 2009, 21 patients underwent 25 ablations (21 RFA, 4 MWA). Fifteen patients had T1a (<2 cm) and 6 had T1b (>2-3 cm) tumors. Mean age was 69 (42-84) years. Ten patients were women. The mean nodule diameter was 1.88 (0.8-3) cm. NSCLC was biopsy-confirmed in 17 patients, and 4 were suspicious on biopsy. The median percent-predicted FEV<inf>1</inf> was 39%, and DLCO was 47%. Mean follow-up was 42 months. Three-year overall survival (OS) was 52% (median 39 months) and was not significantly different between nodules diagnosed as NSCLC or suspicious (36 months vs. 51 months, p=0.20), T1a nodules compared to T1b nodules (36 months vs. 39 months, p=0.29), or nodules treated with RFA compared toMWA (36 vs. 50months, p=0.80). LP occurred in 10 patients (47.6%). Median time to LP was 35 months, and was not significantly different between T1a nodules compared to T1b nodules (22 vs. 35 months, p=0.94) or RFA compared to MWA (35 vs. 17 months, p=0.18). OS was not impacted by LP (median 32 vs. 39 months with and without LP, p=0.68). Repeat ablation was performed in 3 patients (once in 2 patients, and twice in 1 patient who remains disease free at 40 months). Mean local progression time following repeat ablation was 14.75 months. Conclusions: Thermal ablation was effective for treating medically inoperable patients with Stage IA NSCLC. The 3-year overall survival exceeded 50% and local progression did not impact overall survival. Thermal ablation remains a viable option for high-risk patients with NSCLC.",English,0

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included data from 248 ablation sessions for lung tumors in 164 patients (92 men; mean age, 59.7 y +/- 9.8): 200 RF ablations (80.6%) and 48 MW ablations (19.4%). Pneumothorax was classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Twelve patients developed mild pneumothorax and were observed for further complications, and 33 developed moderate or severe pneumothorax and were managed with percutaneous aspiration of the pneumothorax. The decision to abort or continue ablation was determined based on clinical response to percutaneous aspiration, clinical distress, and feasibility of applying the applicator within the lesion. Results: Incidence of pneumothorax was 18.1% (45 of 248 sessions), with four (8.9%) occurrences during MW ablation and 41 (91.1%) during RF ablation. Pneumothoraces were mild in 12 sessions (26.7%), moderate in 27 (60%), and severe in six (13.3%). Complete evacuation of the pneumothorax was achieved in 25 of 33 sessions (75.8%). Intercostal tube drainage was indicated in eight sessions (24.2%), including six severe and two moderate pneumothoraces. Pneumothorax evolved immediately after thoracic puncture in 10 patients. Ablation therapy was aborted in two sessions in which severe pneumothorax occurred, and an intercostal chest tube was inserted. Conclusions: Mild pneumothorax can be managed by close observation without interruption of ablation therapy. Manual evacuation was an effective strategy for management of moderate pneumothorax and allowed for adequate positioning of the electrode, but did not suffice for severe and progressive pneumothorax, which required placement of an intercostal chest tube. © 2011 SIR.",English,0

Anatomical surgical resection remains the current standard of care for patients with localised disease and is the best opportunity for long-term survival. Therefore only few patients (15%) are suitable for surgical resection owing to comorbid medical conditions and advanced stage of the disease. In these conditions external beam radiation with or without chemotherapy is used. Treatment results are usually suboptimal compared with surgery, produce a modest improvement in survival and induce a substantial toxicity in these fragile patients. In this way the development of less invasive treatments such as stereotactic radiotherapy, brachytherapy and thermal ablation may be of interest to complement or replace existing therapies. Among the different thermal ablation procedures radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the best developed and evaluated. RFA is safe and technically highly successful. Longterm local control rates drop considerably when tumors are larger than 4 cm, although repeat ablations can be performed. In these cases an adjuvant radiation may offer improvement in outcomes, other ablative techniques such percutaneous micro-wave may be of interest. The effects of lung RFA on quality of life, in particular dyspnea and pain, are now documented with a low procedural morbidity. There is no association with a loss of pulmonary function after RFA. Pneumothorax is the main complication of this procedure and can be problematic in patients with compromised pulmonary function. Preventive measures include planning electrode route to avoid bullae, chest tube placement. In the management of stage I NSCLC the evaluation of RFA is in progress, prospective studies are conducted both in Europe and USA on inoperable patients. First results of retrospective studies are positive and encouraging. In the future trials comparing stererotactic radiotherapy with RFA could be of interest.ln more advanced stages (III A), after assessment of neo adjuvant chemoradiation, the patients may undergo a surgical resection as a local treatment of the tumor. In these patients the use of RFA is not evaluated but can be discussed case by case in a multidisciplinary approach. Lastly RFA may also be used as a treatment for palliation of pain in patients with invasion of the chest wall. Palliation of hempoptysis has been also reported RFA is an attractive option for patients with lung cancers because the lung is a common site for cancer and has substantial functional reserve.",English,0

Destruction by radiofrequency, microwaves or cryotherapy has raised a lot of hope, but many questions remain with regard to the following: - the impact of this treatment on the improvement of local control and on overall progression-free survival - its place in treatment strategy - the target population It is assumed that radiological ablathermy could extend chemotherapy- free interval for metastatic colorectal cancer, which did not benefit from surgical management, with a significant improvement of the quality of life, and finally, it offered an alternative to discontinue chemotherapy treatment. In other metastatic diseases from thyroid, renal or sarcoma origin, the possibility to perform a local treatment that is repeatable and well supported has offered new opportunities for metastatic patients, delaying the setting up of a general treatment. In the future, after solid prospective studies, it is reasonable to hope that the pattern of care for pulmonary metastatic cancer could change.

Journal Article,C. D. Pina,2011,"Ablation for lung, liver malignancies",http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijc.25875,"The term image-guided tumor ablation"" is defined as the direct application of chemical or thermal therapies to a specific focal tumor (or tumors) in an attempt to achieve eradication or substantial tumor destruction. Although tumor ablation procedures can be performed at laparoscopy or surgery, most procedures are performed with a percutaneous approach. Hence, several authors refer to these procedures as ""percutaneous therapies"". The concept of image guidance is stressed in the title to highlight that image guidance is critical to the success of these therapies. Over the past 25 years, several methods for chemical or thermal tumor destruction have been developed and clinically tested. The thermal ablative therapies involved in clinical practice can be classified as either hyperthermic treatments-including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and laser ablation-or cryoablation. The thermal damage caused by heating is dependent on both the tissue temperature achieved and the duration of heating. Heating of tissue at 50degree-55degreeC for 4-6 minutes produces irreversible cellular damage. At temperatures between 60degreeC and 100degreeC near immediate coagulation of tissue is induced, with irreversible damage to mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes of the cells. At more than 100degree-110degreeC, tissue vaporizes and carbonizes. On the other hand, the freezing of tissue with temperatures between-20degreeC and-60degreeC followed by rapid thawing results in cell membrane disruption and induces cell death. For adequate destruction of tumor tissue, the entire target volume must be subjected to cytotoxic temperatures. Among these methods, RFA is currently established as the primary ablative modality at most institutions. RFA is accepted as the best therapeutic choice for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma when liver transplantation or surgical resection are not suitable options and is considered as a viable alternate to surgery for inoperable patients with limited hepatic metastatic disease, especially from colorectal cancer. Recently, RFA has been demonstrated to be a safe and valuable treatment option for patients with unresectable or medically inoperable lung malignancies. Resection should remain the standard therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but RFA may be better than conventional external-beam radiation for the treatment of the high-risk individual with NSCLC. Initial favorable outcomes encourage combining radiotherapy and RFA, especially for treating larger tumors. In the setting of colorectal cancer lung metasta-ses, survival rates provided by RFA in selected patients, are substantially higher than those obtained with any chemotherapy regimens and provide indirect evidence that RFA improves survival in patients with limited lung metastatic disease. Novel non-thermal techniques for tumor ablation-including irreversible electroporation and light activated drug therapy-seem to have potential to overcome the limitations of RFA and warrant further clinical investigation. The efficacy of combination therapies, including ablation plus administration of drug-eluting beads or thermal sensitive drug carriers is also currently being explored.""",English,0

Methods: Fifty-six tumor-mimic models of various sizes were created in 15 pigs by using barium-enriched minced collected thigh muscle injected into the lung of the same animal. Tumors were ablated under fluoroscopic guidance by single-antenna and multiple-antenna microwaves. Results: Thirty-five tumor models were treated in 11 pigs with a single antenna at 75 W for 15 min, with 15 measuring 20 mm in diameter, 10 measuring 30 mm, and 10 measuring 40 mm. Mean circularity of the single-antenna ablation zones measured 0.64 +/- 0.12, with a diameter of 35.7 +/- 8.7 mm along the axis of the antenna and 32.7 +/- 12.8 mm perpendicular to the feeding point. Multiple-antenna delivery of 75 W for 15 min caused intraprocedural death of 2 animals; modified protocol to 60 W for 10 min resulted in an ablation zone with a diameter of 43.0 +/- 7.7 along the axis of the antenna and 54.8 +/- 8.5 mm perpendicular to the feeding point; circularity was 0.70 +/- 0.10 Conclusions: A single microwave antenna can create ablation zones large enough to cover lung tumor mimic models of <4 cm with no heat sink effect from vessels of <6 mm. Synergic use of 3 antennas allows ablation of larger volumes than single-antenna or radiofrequency ablation, but great caution must be taken when 3 antennas are used simultaneously in the lung in clinical practice. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",English,0

Diagnostic studies that anticipate the changes in morphology are essential for earlier detection of residual viable tumor tissue or local recurrences to identify patients who will benefit from a new treatment. Our study has determined the diagnostic yield of PET/CT studies at baseline and follow-up and adequate time between them and the ablation intervention. Seven patients with single tumor lesion with a total of 8 ablations were included. CT and PET/CT studies were performed at baseline and follow-up after ablation. Average times between PET studies at baseline and follow-up and the ablative therapy were 1.8 and 3.4 months, respectively. Mean scores in metabolic activities of the PET at baseline and follow-up were 7.6 and 4.3. g/ml of SUVmax, respectively. The Dual Time Point technique helped to identify viable tissue after ablation in 3 cases. Follow-up PET/CT studies have conditioned the various treatment strategies adopted by clinical oncologists. The high yield of the PET/CT study including the Dual Time Point technique may be considered as a study replacement of initial and follow-up Contrast-Enhanced CT before and after treatment with RFA and AMO, this achieving considerable reduction in the exposure to high radiation levels.

Journal Article,M. Pritchett,2014,Cone-beam CT scanning with electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1378/chest.1994043,"PURPOSE: Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (ENB) has been shown to have superior yield in diagnosing peripheral nodules compared to conventional bronchoscopy. Standard fluoroscopy is most commonly used during these procedures to assist in visualization. Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is increasingly utilized by interventional radiology for percutaneous biopsy, placement of fiducials and application of ablative therapy for lung malignancies. There has been no study with the use of ENB and CBCT used in conjunction. METHODS: We performed ENB using the superDimension iLogic system in conjunction with a 90-degree Edge catheter. After successful navigation to the lesion a brush was deployed for sampling. With the brush extending in the sampling position, a rotational scan was performed to acquire the cone-beam CT images using the Philips Allura Xper FD20 system. RESULTS: The images were manipulated for immediate viewing, which showed the brush in the center of the 1cm lesion. Rapid on-site pathologic evaluation showed evidence of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Due to advanced lung disease and other comorbidities, the patient was not an appropriate surgical candidate and was therefore referred for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge this is the first use of CBCT in conjunction with ENB in humans. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Recent case studies have shown increasing use of CBCT with conventional bronchoscopy, using CBCT itself as a mode of navigation. We feel that these two modalities used in combination have significant potential to both increase diagnostic yield and eventually to confirm location for use of endobronchial-guided ablative therapies for early-stage lung cancer, such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation.",English,0

The utilization of advanced imaging and thermal ablation techniques to control pain in cancer patients will be an important component of effective interventional oncology services as our subspecialty evolves. Materials and Methods: Following Institutional Review Board approval, our group retrospectively collected and analyzed the documented pain relief parameters and subsequent complications recorded as part of the medical record during our performance of percutaneous image-guided palliative ablative procedures during the past year. We chose 2 cases from each of the following categories in order to demonstrate the scope and efficacy of this service: head and neck neoplasms, palliative nerve ablations, osseous metastases, soft tissue masses, thoracic masses, vertebral body neoplasms, and lesions requiring combination interventional therapies (embolization plus ablation). Results: For purposes of this presentation, 13 cases were chosen: one retropharyngeal mass, one mass in the pterygopalatine fossa, one celiac plexus cryoablation, one pudendal nerve microwave ablation, one metastatic renal cell carcinoma lesion in the proximal humerus, one lung cancer metastases to the sternum, one refractory malignant fibrous histiocytoma about the elbow, cryoablation of two painful neoplastic chest wall lesions, two neoplastic thoracic vertebral body fractures treated with ablative cavity creation and cementoplasty, and two cases of pelvic metastsases treated with transcatheter arterial particle embolization followed by CT-guided microwave ablation and cementoplasty. All patients had significant pain relief (>5 points on a 1-10 pain scale) following their procedure.

We reviewed our experience with the use of various ablation modalities in such conditions. Methods and Materials: A retrospective review of patients treated at our institution with percutaneous ablation for unresctable lung or mediastinal malignancies (LMM) was performed, and patients with tumors located less than 10 mm from large vessels or pericardium were identified. All ablations were performed under conscious sedation and local anesthesia. The therapeutic outcomes were evaluated by contrast-enhanced CT after 1 month. Immediate and short term results are presented. Results: Between June 2008 to January 2011 we treated with CT-guided percutaneous ablation 27 patients (mean age 64 years) with lesions located within 10 mm from heart or large vessels. Overall, 13 metastases, 12 NSCLC, 1 thymoma, and 1 mesothelial sarcoma were treated with CT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA, N=14), microwave ablation (MWA, N=7) and cryoablation (CA, N=6). In all cases, the procedure was technically successful. No intra-procedural arrhythmia occurred. In two patients, an electrode penetrated in the pericardium without consequences. Morbidity consisted of pneumothorax (n=7), and pleural effusions (n=3). At 1-month follow-up, CT revealed complete necrosis in 22 cases and partial (from 70 to 90%) necrosis in the 5 cases. Conclusion: In our experience ablation of LMM in close proximity of hearth or large vessels appears effective and associated with acceptable morbidity.

The liver is second only to the lymph nodes as the most common site for metastatic disease. More than half of the patients with metastatic liver disease will die from metastatic complications. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) causes dehydration and necrosis of tumour cells accompanied by small vessel thrombosis, leading to tumour ischaemia and destruction.Objectives: To study the beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection compared with no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in patients with liver metastases.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, and CINAHL up to December 2012.Selection criteria: We included all randomised clinical trials assessing the beneficial and harmful effects of percutaneous ethanol injection versus no intervention, other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in patients with liver metastases.Data collection and analysis: We extracted the relevant information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcome measures, and data on the outcome measures for our review, as well as information on the design and methodology of the studies. Quality assessment of the trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria and data extraction from the trials retrieved for final evaluation were done by one author and checked by a second author.Main results: One randomised clinical trial was included, comparing transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) + percutaneous intratumour ethanol injection (PEI) versus TACE alone. Forty-eight patients with liver metastases were included; 25 received the intervention with PEI and 23 received TACE alone.Mortality data were not reported. The trial reported the survival data after one, two, and three years. In the TACE + PEI group, 92%, 80%, and 64% of the patients survived after 1, 2, and 3 years respectively; in the TACE group, 78.3%, 65.2%, and 47.8% of the patients survived after 1, 2, and 3 years respectively. The hazard ratio was 0.57 (95% CI 0.19 to 1.67). The local recurrence was 16% in the TACE + PEI group and 39.1% in the TACE group, resulting in a relative risk (RR) of 0.41 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.07). Forty-five tumours (66.2%) out of 68 tumours in total shrunk by at least 25% in the TACE + PEI group versus 31 tumours (48.4%) out of 64 tumours in total in the TACE group (RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.03 to 4.2). The authors reported some adverse events, but with very few details.Authors' conclusions: On the basis of one small randomised trial, it can be concluded that addition of PEI to TACE, as compared with TACE alone, in patients with liver metastases seems to bring no clear benefit in terms of survival and local recurrence. The size of the tumour necrosis was larger in the combined treatment group. No intervention-related mortality or major complications were reported. More trials are needed.",,0

The liver is second only to the lymph nodes as the most common site for metastatic disease. More than half of the patients with metastatic liver disease will die from metastatic complications. Chemoembolisation is based on the concept that the blood supply to hepatic tumours originates predominantly from the hepatic artery. Therefore, embolisation of the hepatic artery can lead to selective necrosis of the liver tumour while it may leave normal parenchyma virtually unaffected.Objectives: To study the beneficial and harmful effects of transarterial (chemo)embolisation compared with no intervention or placebo intervention in patients with liver metastases.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, and CINAHL up to December 2012.Selection criteria: We included all randomised clinical trials assessing beneficial and harmful effects of transarterial (chemo)embolisation compared with no intervention or placebo intervention in patients with liver metastases, no matter the location of the primary tumour.Data collection and analysis: We extracted relevant information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcome measures, and data on the outcome measures for our review as well as information on the design and methodology of the studies. Bias risk assessment of the trials, fulfilling the inclusion criteria, and data extraction from the retrieved final evaluation trials were done by one author and checked by a second author.Main results: One randomised clinical trial fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the review. Sixty-one patients with colorectal liver metastases were randomised into three intervention groups: 22 received hepatic artery embolisation, 19 received hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy, and 20 were randomised to control, described as no active therapeutic intervention, although symptomatic treatment was provided whenever necessary"". As hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy is not in the scope of this review, we have not included the data from this intervention group. In the remaining two groups that were of interest to the review, 43 of the participants were men and 18 women. Most tumours were synchronous metastases involving up to 75% of the liver and non-resectable. The risk of bias in the trial was judged to be high.Patients were followed-up for a minimum of seven months. Mortality at last follow-up was 86% (19/22) in the hepatic artery embolisation group versus 95% (19/20) in the control group (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.1), that is, no statistically significant difference was observed. Median survival after trial entry was 7.0 months (range 2 to 44) in the hepatic artery embolisation group and 7.9 months (range 1 to 26) in the control group. Nine out of 22 (41%) in the hepatic artery embolisation group and five out of 20 (25%) in the control group developed evidence of extrahepatic disease (RR 1.64; 95% CI 0.60 to 4.07). Local recurrence was reported for 10 patients in the trial without details about the trial group. Most patients in the embolisation group experienced post-embolic syndrome (82%), and one patient had local haematoma. No other adverse events were reported. The authors did not report if there were any adverse events in the control group.Authors' conclusions: On the basis of one small randomised trial that did not describe sequence generation, allocation concealment or blinding, it can be concluded that in patients with liver metastases no significant survival benefit or benefit on extrahepatic recurrence was found in the embolisation group in comparison with the palliation group. The probability for selective outcome reporting bias in the trial is high. At present, transarterial (chemo)embolisation cannot be recommended outside randomised clinical trials.""",,0

Electro-coagulation is the coagulation (clotting) of tissue using a high-frequency electrical current applied locally with a metal instrument or needle with the aim of stopping bleeding. The object of this technique is to destroy the tumour completely, if possible, in a single surgical session.Objectives: To study the beneficial and harmful effects of electro-coagulation compared with no intervention, to other ablation methods, or systemic treatments in patients with liver metastases.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, LILACS, and CINAHL up to December 2012.Selection criteria: We included one randomised clinical trial that assessed beneficial and harmful effects of electro-coagulation and its comparators in patients with liver metastases, irrespective of the location of the primary tumour.Data collection and analysis: We extracted relevant information on participant characteristics, interventions, study outcome measures, and data on the outcome measures as well as information on the design and methodology of the trials. Risk of bias of the trials and data extraction was carried out by one author and checked by a second author.Main results: We included one randomised clinical trial that compared four groups: electro-coagulation alone, electro-coagulation + dimethyl sulphoxide, electro-coagulation + allopurinol, and control (Salim 1993). The risk of bias in the trial is high. In three groups, patients had their metastases destroyed with diathermy electro-coagulation (current set at No 5) and received: 1) solution of allopurinol by mouth 5 mL 4 x a day or 2) allopurinol by mouth 5 mL (50 mg) 4 x a day or 3) dimethyl sulphoxide by mouth 5 mL (500 mg) 4 x a day. In the control group patients received a solution of allopurinol by mouth 5 mL 4 x a day. The treatment was started in the fifth postoperative day and was continued for five years. Three hundred and six patients who had undergone resection of the sigmoid colon and who had five or more hepatic metastases were included; 75 received electro-coagulation alone (58 were evaluable), 76 received electro-coagulation plus allopurinol (53 were evaluable), 78 received electro-coagulation plus dimethyl sulphoxide (57 were evaluable), and 77 were in the control group (55 evaluable).The authors reported the number of deaths due to disease spread (100% in the control, 98% in electro-coagulation, 87% in electro-coagulation + allopurinol, and 86% in the electro-coagulation + dimethyl sulphoxide groups). There was a significant benefit in favour of the electro-coagulation + allopurinol (risk ratio (RR) 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 0.96)) and electro-coagulation + dimethyl sulphoxide (RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.95)) groups compared to the control group, but no such benefit in the electro-coagulation alone group (RR 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.02)) compared to the control group. There were no local recurrences, no positive tests for occult blood, and observed pulmonary metastases were always with ultrasonographic evidence of hepatic secondaries and were not significantly different for the experimental groups compared to the control group (electro-coagulation: RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.4 to 3.09)), electro-coagulation + allopurinol (RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.28 to 2.66)), electro-coagulation + dimethyl sulphoxide (RR 0.8 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.48)). None of the adverse events were significantly associated with treatment.Authors' conclusions: On the basis of one randomised trial which did not describe its methodology in sufficient detail to assess risk of bias and quality, excluded 7% of patients after randomisation due to various reasons, and is probably not free from selective outcome reporting bias, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that in patients with colonic cancer liver metastases, electro-coagulation alone brings any significant benefit in terms of survival or recurrence compared with the control. In addition, there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of adding allopurinol or dimethyl sulphoxide to electro-coagulation. The probability for selective outcome reporting bias in the trial is high. More randomised trials are needed in order to sufficiently validate electro-coagulation with or without co-interventions.",,0

Currently, 3 different modalities are available: radiofrequency, microwave, and cryoablation. Radiofrequency ablation remains to date the most developed although the other 2 modalities have their own distinct advantages. Percutaneous ablation can be used for treatment of stage 1 and 2 non-small cell lung carcinoma either alone or in combination with other therapies. Specifically, their noninvasive nature allows them to be used on patients who are otherwise deemed nonoperable. Percutaneous ablation can also be used to treat stage 3a non-small cell lung carcinoma in carefully selected patients. With nonlung primaries, percutaneous ablation can be used to control limited pulmonary metastasis, recurrences after alternative treatments, or to provide pain relief. Although the long-term data for percutaneous ablation is still being investigated, their noninvasive nature and efficacy will ensure their viability and evolution in the future. In this article we review the indications for percutaneous ablation, evaluation of the potential patient, an overview of the ablation options currently available, procedural details, potential complications, and expected results and follow-up. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",English,0

Complete resection of hepatic CRC metastases can provide a long-term cure for some patients, but the majority of liver metastases are not amenable to such surgery. Furthermore, most patients after curative resection ultimately suffer from recurrence, and the majority of such failures occur in the liver. Various ablative techniques can achieve local control of tumor after incomplete resection or for palliation. Tumor ablation currently has a secondary therapeutic role, as there is no evidence that it can achieve long-term survival comparable to surgical resection. Regional chemotherapy delivers tumoricidal agents in a selective fashion, minimizing systemic toxicity and damage to normal liver cells. Chemotherapy agents delivered through the hepatic artery can extend time to liver recurrence after curative resection and may prolong survival both in the adjuvant setting and when given to patients with unresectable disease. Molecular-based therapies, such as gene delivery and oncolytic viruses, provide promise for curative outcomes in patients with advanced disease. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",English,0

Fernando,2010,Microwave ablation of lung tissue: Impact of single-lung ventilation on ablation size,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.05.068,"Background: Thermal ablation is increasingly used to treat pulmonary tumors in medically inoperable patients. Most procedures are performed with sedation in the radiology suite. Ideally, the ablation should encompass the entire tumor volume with a surrounding margin of necrosis; however, ablation may not be as effective in the normal aerated lung surrounding a denser tumor. Inducing atelectasis of the lung may potentially increase ablation volumes and increase local cancer control. This study examines the effect of single-lung ventilation on ablation size using a microwave system. Methods: Twenty microwave ablation procedures were performed in the lungs of 10 swine. Bilateral thoracotomy using a clamshell approach was used. In one lung, ablation was performed with continuous ventilation. In the contralateral lung, single-lung ventilation was achieved by clamping the bronchus before ablation. The ablated lobes were resected and sent for pathologic analysis. Routine and supravital staining was performed. Results: The ablation zone was clearly demarcated on gross examination, and in all cases 100% ablation occurred, without skip areas of viability. The ablation zones were elliptical with the long axis parallel to the axis of the ablation probes (active tip, 3.7 cm). Ablation diameters and volume were compared between the ventilated and nonventilated lungs. Ablation volume was superior in nonventilated lungs (10.74 cm<sup>3</sup> versus 7.35 cm <sup>3</sup>; p = 0.039) primarily because of differences in the short axis of the ablation zone. Conclusions: Microwave energy can effectively ablate normal pulmonary parenchyma without skip areas of viable tissue within the gross ablation field. The volume of necrosis is increased in nonventilated lungs, suggesting that ablation results can be improved in patients by using general anesthesia with single-lung ventilation. Future studies will be required to confirm this hypothesis. © 2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",English,0

Journal Article,T. Schneider,2015,[Thermal ablation of malignant lung tumours],10.1055/s-0034-1368542,"In Germany in about 50,000 patients lung cancer is diagnosed per year - actually it is the tumour most likely to result in death. Furthermore, the lung is the second most common site of distant metastases of extrathoracic tumours. In recent years image-guided thermo-ablative techniques are increasingly being used in patients unable to undergo surgery. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most frequently used technique, cryoablation, microwave-ablation and laser-induced thermoablation are new and promising techniques. Actually there is only a small evidence base, only retrospective and prospective case series have been published as yet. Randomised controlled trials have not been conducted up to now. RFA results in a local control of tumour growth in about 90 %. Long-term results indicate 5-year survival rates of 20-61 % in patients with lung cancer or lung metastases. Pneumothorax is the most common morbidity - requiring drainage in about 10 % after the intervention. In the long term no loss of pulmonary function results after the ablation of peripheral lesions. Peripherally localised tumours < 3 cm in diameter are the most promising targets, the treatment of centrally localised tumours is subtle due to the heat-loss"" effect. The current evidence is insufficient to develop a procedure for differential indication of ablative techniques versus stereotactic radiotherapy. Tumour ablation always should be indicated on the basis of interdisciplinary consensus (including pulmonologists, oncologists, thoracic surgeons, radiotherapists). Inoperability should be assigned by the thoracic surgeon himself. Actually it cannot be considered an alternative to surgery for the treatment of malignant lung tumours with curative intent, however thermal ablation broadens the range of treatment options for patients being no candidates for surgery.""",ger,0

Dienemann,2015,Thermal ablation of malignant lung tumors,", http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/054/CN-01040054/frame.html","Background: About 50 000 new cases of non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung are diagnosed in Germany each year. More than 20% of the affected patients cannot be offered radical resection because of comorbidity alone. The lung is also the second most common site of distant metastases of extrathoracic tumors; it is the only site of such metastases in 20% of cases. In recent years, image-guided thermoablation has been used with increasing frequency in patients who are unable to undergo surgery for medical reasons. Methods: The PubMed database was selectively searched for publications on the indications, complications, and results of the thermoablative techniques currently in clinical use, with special attention to radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Results: There is only a small evidence base to date concerning the treatment of malignant lung tumors with thermoablation. Retrospective and prospective case series have been published, but no randomized controlled trials have yet been conducted. RFA, the most common technique, involves the image-guided percutaneous placement of one or more probes in the tumor, to which thermal energy is then applied. For peripherally located tumors that measure less than 3 cm in diameter, local control of tumor growth can be achieved in about 90% of cases. The long-term results that are now available from smaller series provisionally indicate 5-year survival rates of 20% to 61%. The most common complication is pneumothorax requiring drainage, which occurs in about 10% of cases. In the intermediate term, thermoablation does not cause any clinically relevant loss of pulmonary function. Conclusion: Image-guided thermoablation cannot now be considered an alternative to surgery for the treatment of malignant lung tumors with curative intent. It does, however, widen the spectrum of therapeutic options for patients who are medically unable to undergo a surgical procedure.",,0

PMCT was used for local control of the lesions, and the efficacy of this treatment was assessed. Methods: In 15 patients, a microwave electrode (specially designed for this purpose, 25 cm long and 2.0 mm thick) was inserted percutaneously into the tumor area under ultrasonic guidance. Microwaves at 80 watts were used to irradiate the tumor and the surrounding area. Results: Thirteen of the 15 metastatic tumors were radically ablated by 3-10 applications of microwave irradiation. Although the follow-up period was short (9-37 months), 10 patients survived. No recurrence has been detected in the treated area (except two foci where PMCT was insufficient), and no serious side effects or complications were encountered during or after the PMCT. In four of the five nonsurviving patients, death was due to metastases to the bone, brain, lung, or other areas of the liver despite complete local tumor control by PMCT.

Materials and Methods: Following an IRB waiver, we conducted a retrospective review of our prospectively created and maintained HIPPA registered clinical ablation database to identify all patients treated with microwave ablation for colorectal liver metastasis<5 cm with no more than 3 liver tumors at the time of ablation. Technique effectiveness, defined as successful ablation with no residual tumor was assessed on triphasic CT 4-8 weeks post-ablation. Scans were repeated every 2-4 months to assess for tumor progression. Kaplan Meier methodology was employed to calculate progression free survival. Complications were recorded. Results: 26 patients, 14 males (54%) and 12 females (47%) underwent microwave ablation of 27 CLM from July 2008 to March 2013 with a median follow up of 8.5 months; (range 5- 61) months. The median lesion size was 1.8 cm; range (0.7-3.6) cm. Technique effectiveness was 96%, (26/27). The one year local tumor progression free probability was 84%. Local progression occurred in 2 lesions after a period of 10 and 21 months respectively. Both were retreated successfully with no progression to date. Complications included pneumothorax (n=2) treated by thoracostomy, asymptomatic left portal vein thrombosis with segmental liver infarction, and transient deterioration of pulmonary function in an asthmatic patient who had simultaneous lung ablation.

Materials and Methods: This study consisted of a HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved retrospective review of data in 162 patients with 233 CLMs treated with percutaneous RFA between December 2002 and December 2012. Contrast material-enhanced CT was used to assess technique effectiveness 4-8 weeks after RFA. Patients were followed up with contrast-enhanced CT every 2-4 months. Overall survival (OS) and local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS) were calculated from the time of RFA by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank tests and Cox regression models were used for univariate and multivariate analysis to identify predictors of outcomes. Results: Technique effectiveness was 94% (218 of 233). Median LTPFS was 26 months. At univariate analysis, predictors of shorter LTPFS were tumor size greater than 3 cm (P <001), ablation margin size of 5 mm or less (P <001), high modified CRS (P = .009), male sex (P = .03), and no history of prior hepatectomy (P = .04) or hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (P = .01). At multivariate analysis, only tumor size greater than 3 cm (P = .01) and margin size of 5 mm or less (P <001) were independent predictors of shorter LTPFS. Median and 5-year OS were 36 months and 31%. At univariate analysis, predictors of shorter OS were tumor size larger than 3 cm (P = .005), carcinoembryonic antigen level greater than 30 ng/mL (P = .003), high modified CRS (P = .02), and extrahepatic disease (EHD) (P <001). At multivariate analysis, tumor size greater than 3 cm (P = .006) and more than one site of EHD (P <001) were independent predictors of shorter OS. Conclusion: Tumor size of less than 3 cm and ablation margins greater than 5 mm are essential for satisfactory local tumor control. Tumor size of more than 3 cm and the presence of more than one site of EHD are associated with shorter OS.",English,0

Hiraoka,2003,Cholangitis and liver abscess after percutaneous ablation therapy for liver tumors: incidence and risk factors,", ","PURPOSE: To determine the risk factors of cholangitis and liver abscess occurring after percutaneous ablation therapy for liver tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 1995 and September 2002, 358 patients with 455 liver tumors underwent a total of 683 ablation procedures, such as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), percutaneous microwave coagulation (PMC), and radiofrequency (RF) ablation therapy. With a retrospective review of medical records, the rates and outcomes of cholangitis and/or liver abscess occurring after ablation therapy were evaluated. The relationship between cholangitis and/or liver abscess and multiple variables (age, disease, Child-Pugh class, size of nodules, multiplicity of nodules, history of transcatheter arterial embolization, presence of bilioenteric anastomosis, and lack of prophylactic antibiotics administration) were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Cholangitis and/or liver abscess occurred in 10 sessions (1.5%) in 10 patients: six sessions after PEI, three sessions after PMC, and one session after RF ablation. Both cholangitis and liver abscess were noted in seven sessions, cholangitis was noted in two, and liver abscess was noted in one. Six patients recovered, but two developed recurrent cholangitis and liver abscess, one developed lung abscess complicated with liver abscess, and one died of septic shock associated with cholangitis. On stepwise regression analysis, bilioenteric anastomosis was the sole significant predictor of cholangitis and/or liver abscess formation (P <.001; odds ratio = 36.4; 95% CI = 9.67-136.9). CONCLUSION: Bilioenteric anastomosis strongly correlated with the development of cholangitis and/or liver abscess after percutaneous ablation therapy.

The most important prognostic factors in patients with recurrent HCCs were (1) the period until recurrence (within 1 year or more than 1 year after hepatectomy), (2) the types of recurrence (nodular type: three or less intrahepatic nodules, multiple type (more than four intrahepatic multiple nodules) and extrahepatic types such as to the lung and bone, and (3) the types of treatment received after recurrence (a repeat hepatectomy, the combination of either Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Therapy (PEIT), Microwave Coagulation Therapy (MCT) and Lipiodolization (LPD), or LPD alone). Regarding the treatment for recurrent HCC, a repeat hepatectomy is the best choice, however, it is extremely important to understand that a repeat hepatectomy is the best choice, however, it is extremely important to understand that a repeat hepatectomy is actually indicated for quite a limited number patients, since it is only indicated for nodular-type recurrence and patients with a preserved liver function. A poor liver function was another prognostic factor, since treatment for recurrence is limited due to a poor liver function reserve. Regarding the treatment strategy after recurrence, in either nodular type or the multiple type (a small number of tumors), a repeat hepatectomy remains the first choice of treatment when the liver function is sufficiently preserved, otherwise either LPD, MCT, PEIT or their combination is indicated. In the multiple type (a large number of tumors), only LPD is indicated. In extrahepatic recurrence, a surgical resection is indicated only in the case of isolated recurrence either without any intrahepatic recurrence or with a well-controlled intrahepatic recurrence. The establishement of an effective disciplinary treatment against early multiple (diffuse) recurrence, extrahepatic recurrence, or patients with a poor liver function is urgently needed.",English,0

The occurrence of a sonographic masked space due to the presence of the lung, however, has become a major obstacle to visualizing the whole tumor in the hepatic dome. To facilitate the use of PMCT for liver tumors in the hepatic dome, we developed PMCT in combination with the artificial hydrothorax method (percutaneous transdiaphragmatic MCT: PTD-MCT). Our new approach for PMCT to the hepatic tumors located in Couinaud's segments VIII or VII just under the diaphragm resulted in a successful treatment. The separation of the lung from the diaphragm by the infusion of saline into the pleural cavity enabled us not only to visualize the whole tumor in the hepatic dome to accurately target the tumor, but also helped us to avoid injuring the lung. PTD-MCT is therefore strongly recommended for the treatment of liver tumors in the hepatic dome.",English,0

When combined with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MCT can be used to treat hepatic tumors located in the subdiaphragmatic area that are difficult to approach by ultrasound, because of the overlaying lower lung field. Methods: To determine the usefulness of thoracoscopy-assisted interventional MR-MCT (T-IVMR-MCT, n = 73), we compared patients with hepatic tumors that were treated with percutaneous IVMR-MCT (P-IVMR-MCT, n = 69) and with T-IVMR-MCT. Results: None of patient background, complication and recurrence rate, or length of hospital stay significantly differed between the 2 groups. Conclusions: IVMR-MCT is a useful modality for treating hepatic tumors. Especially when tumors are located at the hepatic dome, T-IVMR-MCT was minimally invasive, while it appears to improve targeting of peridiagmatic hepatic lesions and has a complication profile similar to P-IVMR-MCT. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Until recently, lung cancer treatment options (dependent upon the tumor grading and staging at presentation, and patient comorbidities) included surgical resection (lobar or sublobar), chemotherapy and external-beam radiation therapy. While these options are still viewed as the primary standard of care, newer minimally invasive percutaneous ablative techniques such as radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation and cryoablation are currently being examined as treatment alternatives, especially in the setting of the nonsurgical candidate.

Mayo-Smith,2005,Microwave ablation: Principles and applications,http://dx.doi.org/10.1148/rg.25si055501,"Microwave ablation is the most recent development in the field of tumor ablation. The technique allows for flexible approaches to treatment, including percutaneous, laparoscopic, and open surgical access. With imaging guidance, the tumor is localized, and a thin (14.5-gauge) microwave antenna is placed directly into the tumor. A microwave generator emits an electromagnetic wave through the exposed, noninsulated portion of the antenna. Electromagnetic microwaves agitate water molecules in the surrounding tissue, producing friction and heat, thus inducing cellular death via coagulation necrosis. The main advantages of microwave technology, when compared with existing thermoablative technologies, include consistently higher intratumoral temperatures, larger tumor ablation volumes, faster ablation times, and an improved convection profile. Microwave ablation has promising potential in the treatment of primary and secondary liver disease, primary and secondary lung malignancies, renal and adrenal tumors, and bone metastases. The technology is still in its infancy, and future developments and clinical implementation will help improve the care of patients with cancer. ©RSNA, 2005.",English,0

Evidence to support its use, particularly for metastases from colonic primary tumours, is now strong, with survival data in selected cases approaching that seen after surgery. Because of this, the use of ablative techniques (particularly thermal ablation) is growing and the Royal College of Radiologists predict that the number of patients who could benefit from such treatment may reach in excess of 5000 per year in the UK. Treatment is often limited to larger regional centres, and general radiologists often have limited awareness of the current indications and the techniques involved. Furthermore, radiologists without any prior experience are frequently expected to interpret post-treatment imaging, often performed in the context of acute complications, which have occurred after discharge.

To discuss different approaches for imaging guidance and monitoring 2. To discuss how to evaluate tumour response to treatment 3. To discuss results of RFA Ablation of liver tumors has the longest track record of all the organs. RF ablation was employed in the treatment of primary and secondary liver malignant tumors since the early 1990s. Despite the relatively large numbers of liver tumor RF ablation performed, there are still no prospective controlled trials of RF ablation versus surgery. This is partially due to the fact that surgery considered the gold standard of care is offered to patients as the first line treatment, whereas ablation and especially image-guided percutaneous ablation is used for the treatment of patients non-eligible for surgery. Designing the appropriate randomized controlled trial requires multidisciplinary coordination and agreement and several such efforts have not yet been successful. The most frequently treated populations are patients with colon cancer liver metastases and those with small HCC. In these patients, the overall survival after ablation appears to be identical to those treated with hepatectomy. It is of note, however, that especially in the patients with colon cancer liver metastases (CLM), local progression rates after ablation are higher than surgical results. Several factors have been recognized as critical regarding ablation outcomes. These include the size, location and numbers of lesions to be treated. Most series seem to agree that lesions up to 3 cm can be treated effectively with reported complete ablation rates of about 90%. For lesions larger than 3 cm the efficacy of thermal ablation decreases and multiple overlapping ablations are the rule for lesion coverage by the ablation defect. Complete ablation is possible for lesions up to 5 cm provided that their location allows the performance of several overlapping treatments. For lesions larger than 5 cm size complete ablation is unlikely. Larger tumor size may be managed by combination of an arterially directed therapy such as bland (TAE), chemoembolization (TACE) or precision TACE with ablation. This is, in particular, true for hepatocellular carcinoma where solitary tumors up to 7 or 8 cm can be managed successfully with combination of ablation and embolization. Lesion location is an important factor influencing outcomes after ablation. Central (near the hilum) lesions should be avoided because of the risk of central bile duct and vascular injury. Larger lesions abutting a blood vessel are more difficult to control and may be associated with lower rates of response due to the already described heat sink"" effect that limits the effect of any type of thermal ablation. A new form of non-thermal ablation called irreversible electroporation may be applied to some of these lesions. Electrode choice should be tailored to lesion shape, geometry and size; keeping in mind that the ablation defect should encompass the lesion and create a surrounding margin of at least 0.5 cm all around the treated lesion similar to a 'surgical margin'. Consider the use of co-axial access needles to allow for repositioning the electrode when you are performing overlapping ablations. Lesions may be difficult to accurately see and target with non-contrast CT and image guidance may become obscured with ultrasound. Recent technological advances allowing the use of CT fluoroscopy and PET/ CT fusion during ablation may be used to increase accuracy of tumor targeting. The evaluation of the ablation defect by imaging is critical and should be performed after each ablation session. A 3-phase contrast-enhanced CT at the end of the ablation is the author's recommendation and should be performed in every case unless if there is a clinical contraindication to the administration of contrast. Passing the electrode through liver parenchyma and tract ablation is recommended whenever possible to diminish the possibility of track seeding as well as bleeding. Earlier reports of alarming needle tract seeding rates were observed after ablati n of subcapsular HCC. Lesions at difficult locations such as at the liver dome, diaphragm or segment 2 lesions near the pericardium pose several technical challenges and may be associated with increased risks. Several techniques can be used to overcome these challenges: use of general anesthesia for respiration control, pre-ablation arterial embolization with radiopaque particles (or lipiodol) for lesion identification (especially for echo-poor lesions), use of single electrode (no tines) probes or microwave ablation instead of RFA. Hydrodissection performed with the instillation of Dextrose (D5 W) can be used to push the liver away from the dome or from an adjacent organ such as the pericardium. CT fluoroscopy and MRI guidance may also diminish difficulties when targeting lesions in difficult locations. In general, every effort should be made to perform a safe ablation with clear margins. Liver tumor ablation is a relatively low risk procedure. The following table shows the types and reported rates of complications as well as relevant risks factors that may predispose to a complication. (Table presented) Risks of percutaneous RF ablation specifically for HCC The most severe complication is liver failure that can be fatal. This is an extremely rare complication; however, the risk increases as the hepatic reserve decreases and the ablation volume increases. For patients with compensated liver function and single ablation the risk of liver failure is reported to be about or less than 1%. Risks related to any liver tumor ablation Proper procedure planning and prophylactic techniques such as hydrodissection will keep complications low and will allow the performance of safe ablations even when the lesions are in challenging positions. Pneumothorax during ablation of liver lesions can occur when treating lesions near the diaphragmatic dome. Similar to lung ablation, thoracostomy will manage the pneumothorax and will allow the completion of the ablation treatment in the vast majority of patients. Liver abscess is probably the most common complication in patients with compromised sphincter of Oddi (after any biliary intervention such as stent placement, or reconstruction, post-Whipple procedure). In this particular subset of patients the risk of abscess formation after any locoregional hepatic treatment including ablation is very high approaching 80%. Proper identification of this population and coverage with bile excreted antibiotics is essential to decrease this risk. Follow up Most centers advocate an initial follow up with contrastenhanced CT or MRI at 4-8 weeks after ablation and every 3 months thereafter. It is important to use the initial post-ablation scan as a new baseline for all future comparisons. According to ablation reporting standards this initial post-ablation imaging scan should be used for the evaluation of technique effectiveness that is represented by an ablation defect completely covering the lesion and no evidence of residual tumor. The ablation defect and the lack of contrast enhancement are considered surrogates for tumor necrosis and effective ablation. The ablation defect should be larger than the original lesion. Ideally it should provide a uniform margin around the tumor of 10 mm. A 5-mm margin is considered the minimum technical requirement for ablation with curative intent. Subsequent scans should show a reduction in size of the ablation defect albeit unpredictably. After ablation, tumor markers and PET scans can be used to detect residual or recurrent disease; especially for PET avid lesions such as colon and breast metastases. As a matter of fact in these types of lesions PET CT may detect local tumor progression (recurrence) earlier than dynamic CT or MRI. Evidence-based practice For hepatomas smaller than 3 cm in patients who are not liver transplant candidates, RFA has been repeatedly shown to be equivalent to surgical resection with fewer complications. Several series have also shown that ablation may provide further survival benefit to patients with larger hepatomas when added to an emboliza ion treatment including small particle bland embolization and TACE. Series of ablation for colon cancer liver metastases (CLM) up to 3 cm have shown comparable results to historic survival data after hepatectomy despite a relatively higher rate of local tumor progression after percutaneous ablation. Most recent studies applied a clinical risk score system that correlated well with local tumor progression free and overall survival after percutaneous RF ablation of colon cancer liver metastases recurring after hepatectomy. Similar to previously described surgical risk score, the modified clinical risk score took into consideration the presence of lymph node involvement at the time of the primary tumor resection, the disease-free interval from time of primary diagnosis to the detection of liver metastasis, the size of the tumor and the total number of liver tumors at the time of the ablation. Patients that accumulated a low risk score (up to 2 risk factors) had prolonged survivals when compared to those with scores of 3 or higher. It is reasonable to offer ablation as the first treatment of a small CLM within the concept of the ""Test of time"". This concept requires very close follow-up of the treated patients. Those that recur locally must be retreated with ablation or surgery. Those who recur in multiple sites and often extrahepatic sites are not candidates for locoregional treatment but have been spared an unnecessary hepatectomy that carries significant morbidity and not negligible mortality. Finally, those that remain without recurrence are considered treated by the ablation and must continue follow-up for several years.""",,0

Materials and Methods: We reviewed the medical records, procedural reports and all available images in PACS of patients that underwent ablation for tumor progression (recurrence) post-pneumonectomy at two tertiary care institutions, between 1999-2009. Out of a total of 619 percutaneous lung ablations, we performed 17 percutaneous ablations in 16 sessions to treat 13 tumors (9 primary and 4 metastatic) in 12 patients (7 men, 5 women, median age: 65, range: 44-85 years) with a single lung. Median tumor size was 2 cm (range, 1.2 - 4 cm). Radiofrequency was used in 15 and Microwave ablation in 2 ablations. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Results: Technically successful ablation was documented in 16/17 (94%) cases at 4-6 weeks post-procedure imaging (contrast enhanced CT or PET CT). Local tumor progression (LTP) occurred in 5 lesions within a median of 12 months after ablation (range, 10 - 22 months). LTP was treated with second ablation in 4/5 cases. One lesion recurred a second time and was treated with radio surgery (Cyber Knife). Pneumothorax occurred in 6/17 (35%) sessions; requiring thoracostomy in 5/17 (29%). Other postprocedure complications were pulmonary hemorrhage and reactive pneumonitis. Procedure related mortality occurred in 3 cases (19%) within 2-12 days from the ablation as a result of progressive respiratory failure. As of our latest follow-up 3 patients died (18, 21 and 53 months) and 6 patients are alive without LTP. Conclusion: Tumor progression complicating pneumonectomy can effectively be treated by ablation. This patient population with a single lung is at higher risk, therefore the treating physician must be prepared for prompt management of complications.",English,0

Some studies showed that microwaves may induce apoptosis in some tumor cells. The apoptotic effect of microwaves may help in clinic to remove residual malignant cells nearby the primary lesion and avoid relapse subsequently. However, there is little evidence on this subject from lung cancer. We studied the effect of microwaves on inducing apoptosis in the human lung carcinoma cell line A549 cells, aiming to identify its effect on apoptosis. Methods A549 cells were radiated by various intensities and durations of microwaves. Apoptosis induction in A549 cells was analyzed by morphological observations, tetrazolium blue color method (MTT) assays, flow cytometery, immunohistochemistry, and image analyses. Results Morphological changes in A549 cells, including cell shrinking and nuclear pycnosis, were observed after microwave radiation. Microwaves significantly inhibited metabolic activities and induced apoptosis in A549 cells. The results of the MTT assay showed a significant decrease of cell activities in all the radiation groups compared with the normal control (P <0.01). The low point of cell activities often appeared at 6-12 hours after radiation. Apoptosis was also confirmed by flow cytometery. The early stage apoptotic rate reached 6.10%-17.98% and the advanced stage apoptotic rate + necrosis rate reached 8.04%-44.06% at 6 hours after microwave irradiation, in contrast to 2.32% and 4.10% in the respective control groups. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and up-regulation of p53 expression were observed by immunohistochemistry after radiation. In most treated groups, the down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression reached its lowest level at 3-6 hours after radiation (integrated optical density (IOD)-6 hours: 2.13+/-0.08-5.14+/-0.13 vs. control: 5.79+/-0.10, P <0.01) and the up-regulation of P53 expression peaked at about 3 hours (IOD-3 hours: 2.61+/-0.13-8.07+/-0.11 vs. control: 1.29+/-0.07, P <0.01). Cell damage, apoptosis, and protein expression levels in the samples differed depending on the radiation intensity and duration. Conclusions Microwaves can promote apoptosis in A549 cells. The effect depends on the duration and dosage of microwave radiation. Bcl-2 and p53 proteins may be involved in the apoptotic process of A549 cells induced by microwaves.",English,0

We used expandable RFA electrodes and in 2 sessions we used microwave energy. Lesions ranged between 3 and10 cm. Time of ablation was 6-16 minutes. The procedure was performed under local anaesthesia after administration of lexotanil 3 mg and zideron 75 mg IM, 45 minutes before starting. Results: elimination of pain was achieved in 74.2% of the cases (15/21) and in the cases there was a significant reduction of pain. No major complications occurred.

Surgical resection has always been considered the standard treatment for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, non-surgical treatment options for patients with early-stage NSCLC have evolved significantly over the past decade with many new and exciting alternative treatments now available. These alternative treatments include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), percutaneous cryoablation therapy (PCT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), including stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy. We describe the established alternatives to surgical resection, their advantages and disadvantages, potential complications and efficacy. We then describe the optimal treatment approach for patients with early-stage NSCLC based on tumor operability, size and location. Finally, we discuss future directions and whether any alternative therapies will challenge surgical resection as the treatment of choice for patients with operable early-stage lung cancer.",eng,0

MWA offers an alternative therapeutical option for patients who are unable to have surgical treatment. Materials and Methods: From February 2008 to February 2010, 14 patients (6 men, 8 women; 32-78 years old) were submitted for percutaneous MWA sessions. All tumors were larger than 3 cm. 21 procedures were performed under local anesthesia by a specially trained interventional radiologist. Optimal approach was determined based on the location of the tumor, and tumors were targeted under CT-guidance. A thin (14.5 G) microwave antenna was placed directly into the tumor. Duration of each session ranged between 3 and 8 minutes. Follow-up contrast enhanced CT scans were obtained at 1, 3, 6 months, 1 year and 18 months. Results: Follow-up contrast media-enhanced CT scans revealed lack of contrast media enhancement in 8 patients (57.2%), whereas partial enhancement was seen in 6 patients (42.8%), who all underwent a second session and one even a third session. Neither major complications nor significant worsening in pulmonary function occurred. Post-ablation syndrome was reported in 5 patients (35.7%). Minor complications occurred in a minority of patients; productive cough occurred in 2 patients (14.2%), small pleural effusions in 2 patients (14.2%). Small pneumothorax occurred in 1 patient (7.1%) and was self limited. Conclusion: MWA is effective and may be safely applied to lung tumors. However, it should only be used in selected patients until longer follow-up studies are available.",English,0

While the outlook is dismal in advanced lung cancer, when patients are diagnosed once they have become symptomatic, the prognosis is more favourable in early stage node-negative disease. Small lung cancers are increasingly diagnosed as incidental findings on cross-sectional imaging such as CT-coronary angiogram (CTCA), CT-pulmonary angiogram (CTPA), CT angiograms for vascular conditions or CT -intravenous pyelogram (CT-IVP). As many as 15% of patients with early stage NSCLC are not eligible for surgery due to comorbidities, usually poor cardio-respiratory reserve. This number doubles in the patient population 75y and older. Approximately 30% of patients dying of malignancy have pulmonary metastases at autopsy with some primary cancers metastasising exclusively to the lungs. In the setting of primary cancer site being under control, reasonably long disease free interval (DFI) and oligometastatic lung disease with metastases of reasonable size and in amenable positions, data shows a survival benefit for metastasectomy in a selected patient population. Metastasectomies, even if performed as sublobar or wedge resections, often carry a substantial morbidity and have a major impact on quality of life. Thermal ablations can be performed in an outpatient setting, they spare healthy tissue, are repeatable and are extremely well tolerated. Thermal ablation has been applied to lung tumours for over a decade and has managed to become an established minimally invasive therapy option for a selected patient population. It is used as a therapeutic means in primary and secondary lung cancer, both with a curative and palliative intent. Combination of thermal ablation with radiotherapy for NSCLC should be a viable consideration in the therapy planning pathway, with available radiofrequency ablation (RFA)/ external radiation therapy (XRT) data showing convincing 5y cumulative survival rates of 39% at no additional toxicity. Microwave ablation (MWA) represents the most recent addition to the growing armamentarium of minimally invasive thermal ablation therapies. Advantages of microwave over RF energy are perceived to be many. RF heating requires an electrical conduction path and is therefore less effective in areas of low electrical conductivity and high baseline impedance such as lung parenchyma. Unlike RF and laser, microwaves can even penetrate through the charred or desiccated tissues that build up around all hyperthermic ablation applicators, resulting in limited power delivery for non-microwave energy systems. Further advantages of MWA over RFA are that the system does not require grounding pads, thus avoiding pad site burns, that implanted cardiac devices are less prone to malfunction during MWA than during RFA and that heating occurs faster with is less susceptibility to heat sink, allowing for larger and more homogenous ablation volumes. Multiple microwave antennas can be powered simultaneously to maximise the ablation volume when placed in close proximity to each other, or when widely spaced, to ablate several tumours simultaneously, particularly helpful in the case of multiple metastatic ablations. This presentation will focus on the indications for pulmonary thermal ablation, the limitations of the procedure and the advantages of MWA over RFA.",English,0

Materials and Methods: After institutional review board (IRB) approval, retrospective analysis was performed of 63 MWA cases at our institution over an 18-month period. The 2 different microwave ablation systems used were manufactured by Covidien (Mansfield, MA) and MedWaves (San Diego, CA). Track ablation was performed in 32 cases. In all cases, immediate postablation dual-phase computed tomography (CT) scans of the liver were performed, during which time incidental note was made of active venous bleeding in 11 cases. Imaging findings for those 11 cases were reviewed by a board-certified radiologist. Technical effectiveness was assessed by evaluating residual tumor post ablation. In addition, vascular origin of bleeding from the track ablation zone, track ablation diameter, and presence of track seeding on follow-up imaging were also evaluated. Exclusion criteria included subcapsular tumors (n=3). Results: The medical records of 8 patients receiving M WA of 8 hepatic tumors including 4 primary hepatocellular carcinomas and 4 metastatic lesions (small cell lung carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, neuroendocrine adenocarcinoma, and esophageal adenocarcinoma) resulting in postprocedure venous bleeding were reviewed. Demographics included 4 male and 4 female patients with an average age of 64.5 years (range, 40-79 years). Average tumor size was 34 mm (range, 17-66 mm) in greatest dimension. Average depth of tumor from capsule was 23.9 mm (range, 7.3-69 mm). Average ablation time was 14.25 minutes (range, 10-15 minutes). Track ablation was performed in all 8 cases, and average track diameter was 11.25 mm (range, 5-20 mm). All cases demonstrated active hepatic (n=5) or portal (n=3) venous extravasation on immediate postprocedure CT scan identified as pericapsular hemorrhage or contrast accumulation. In 2 cases, the probe was reinserted and ablation was performed along the track in an attempt to coagulate the bleeding vessel. No further management was required for the remaining cases. None of the 31 cases in which track ablation was not performed demonstrated venous bleeding. One tumor demonstrated minimal residual enhancement on follow-up. None of the cases demonstrated track seeding on follow-up (range, 4-14 months). Conclusion: Our cohort of cases illustrates isolated, self-limited active venous extravasation originating along the periphery of the track ablation defect immediately post M WA of hepatic tumors. We propose that this finding, which seems to be unique to MWA, may be a result of the higher heat deposition and temperatures created by microwave. There may be increased tissue dehydration and damage to small peripheral vessels, which are not protected by heat sink as a result of slower flow. This may result in active extravasation through an opening created from track ablation. Further studies on the effects of MWA on the vessel wall are needed.",English,0

The past decade has seen the emergence of minimally invasive therapies using thermal energy sources: radiofrequency, cryoablation, focused ultrasound, laser, and microwave; radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the best developed of these. Radiofrequency ablation is safe and technically highly successful in terms of initial ablation. Long-term local control or complete necrosis rates drop considerably when tumors are larger than 3 cm, although repeat ablations can be performed. Patients with lung metastases tend to fare better with RF lung ablation than those with primary lung carcinoma in terms of local control, but it is unclear if this is related to smaller tumor size at time of treatment, lesion size uniformity, and sphericity with lung metastases, or to differences in patterns of pathologic spread of disease. The effects of RFA on quality of life, particularly dyspnea and pain, as well as long-term outcome studies are generally lacking. Even so, the results regarding RF lung ablation are comparable to other therapies currently available, particularlyfor the conventionally unresectable or high-risk lung cancer population. With refinements in technology, patient selection, clinical applications, and methods of follow-up, RFA will continue to flourish as a potentially viable stand-alone or complementary therapy for both primary and secondary lung malignancies in standard and high-risk populations.",English,0

While surgery remains the standard of care treatment for localized disease, many patients are unfit due to their advanced age and medical comorbidities. In these patients, an active surveillance strategy or ablative therapies, including radiofrequency/microwave ablation or cryotherapy, can be offered. Such options have limitations particularly with fast growing, or larger tumors. A promising ablative therapy option to consider is stereo-tactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). SBRT refers to high dose, focally ablative radiation delivered in a short time (3-5 fractions), and is safe and effective in many other cancer sites, including lung, liver and spine. SBRT offers potential advantages in the primary kidney cancer setting due to its ablative dosing (overcoming the notion of radio-resistance""), short treatment duration (important in an elderly population), low toxicity profile (enabling SBRT to treat larger RCCs than other ablative modalities), and non-invasiveness. To date, there is limited long-term prospective data on the outcomes of SBRT in primary RCC. However, early evidence is intriguing with respect to excellent local control and low toxicity; however, most studies vary in terms of technique and radiation dosing used. Well-designed prospective cohort studies with clearly defined and standardized techniques, dosing, follow-up, and integration of quality of life outcomes will be essential to further establish the role of SBRT in management of inoperable, localized RCC.""",eng,0

Methodology: Some patients with multiple liver metastases are not candidates for a complete resection by a single hepatectomy, even when downstaged by chemotherapy, after portal embolization. In two-stage hepatectomy, the highest possible number of tumors is resected in a first, noncurative intervention, and the remaining tumors are resected after a period of liver regeneration. Two-stage hepatectomy was performed in 11 patients. Results: Two-stage hepatectomy was feasible in all of the 11 patients. In 3 of them, the first stage was a major resection (more extensive than a lobectomy). This first hepatectomy was uneventful in all patients. The second hepatectomy was also uneventful in nine patients, but in one of the other two, a perihepatic fluid infection occurred, and in the other, postoperative liver failure developed due to a right subphrenic abscess. However, all patients were discharged. The percentage of the expected resection volume at one time, calculated from CT volumetry, was 75.5+/-1.2% and the prognostic score as surgical risk was 56.6+/-4.5. In two-stage hepatectomy cases, the percentage of the resected volume and the prognostic score in the first hepatectomy were 25.4+/-6.4% and 6.7+/-7.3, and in the second, 45.7+/-4.5% and 28.5+/-5.8. During the follow-up procedures, a residual hepatic recurrence was observed in 6 patients, and pulmonary recurrence in 9. The 1- and 3-year survival rates after the first hepatectomy were 90% and 45%, with median survivals of 18 months from the first hepatectomy. Conclusions: Two-stage hepatectomy is a surgical modality intended for patients with initial unresectable metastases. However, following such surgery, protective treatment against residual liver recurrence and lung metastasis will be a most important issue. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A.",English,0

In the previous years he underwent a subtotal parathyroidectomy, local radiotherapy, chemotherapy and resection of multiple lung metastases. Recurrent lung metastasis was treated by microwave ablation but his condition worsened, due to persistent hypercalcemia. An FDG PET/CT scan revealed a retrosternal nodule, with moderate FDG uptake. Furthermore, there was multifocal bone uptake, involving the costochondral junctions, scapulae and right acetabulum. CT-scan could not depict any abnormality in the skeleton. Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT demonstrated also low grade uptake in the pre-aortic, retrosternal mass but without any bone irregularity. In the literature, several cases of increased focal uptake of FDG and/or MIBI in the skeleton are described in patients with parathyroid carcinoma (1-4). Most reports focus on the increased uptake of FDG or MIBI in brown tumours, presenting on CT-scan as osteolytic lesions. It is known that these bone lesions, occurring in long standing hyperparathyroidism, tend to regress when the hyperparathyroidism is adequately treated. In the case presented here, there was an increased uptake of FDG in the bone, however without underlying radiological abnormality. The predominant symmetrical pattern did not favour the hypothesis of bone metastasis. The patient recovered from his hypercalcemic state following resection of the retrosternal nodule, confirming that the resected nodule was the source of PTH secretion. The multifocal bone uptake on PET scan is considered to be related to an elevated bone turnover, as seen in bone scintigraphy in patients suffering hyperparathyroidism.",English,0

It most commonly originates from lung. Our purpose is to compromise our initial experience in image-guided local tumor ablation of adrenal metastases, with microwave energy. Material and Methods: Over a 1-year period a total of 17 MWC sessions were performed in our hospital (15 patients). 9 of the patients were men and 6 were women, ranging in age between 51 and 80 years. They all had lung cancer. 8 of the adrenal tumors were located on the right and 9 on the left. The diameter of the tumors ranged between 3,8 and 5 cm. The whole procedure of MWC was performed percutaneously, under CT guidance and using local analgesic therapy. The microwave energy was applied for 3 to 5 min. A dual-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced CT was performed after the antenna removal to evaluate the immediate lesion's response to the ablation. Follow-up was performed at 1, 3, and 6 month's post-MWC and every 6 months afterwards. Results: 14/17 (82,3%) tumors showed complete response. 3/17 (17,6%) tumors showed partial necrosis and in those a second MWC was performed. 4/17 tumors showed a local recurrence and they also underwent a second session. Major complications did not occur. Conclusion: MWC of adrenal metastasis is a promising alternative treatment. However, more studies need to be conducted in order to prove its efficacy and establish its role as far as long-term survival is concerned.",English,0

Endoscopic tumor ablation is a valuable option for inoperable postoperative laryngotracheal intraluminal invasion of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Objectives. To investigate whether DTC invasion to the laryngotracheal mucosa can be controlled by 'simple' tumor ablation considering its relatively slow-growing nature. Patients and methods. Twenty-two consecutive patients underwent endoscopic tumor ablation caused by DTC for local control of intraluminal lesions with no significant extrinsic laryngotracheal compression in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients in whom radical operations were contraindicated. Debulking by Nd:YAG laser was followed by electrocoagulation and microwave coagulation for the residual tumor base. Results. The critical complication, post-treatment supraglottic stenosis, was managed by prophylactic minitracheotomy. During the follow-up period of up to 125 months, 6 of 22 patients died (median survival 50 months), mainly of lung metastases, but all had a patent airway at death. Post-surgical extraluminal lesion growth is indolent and since relapse of the intraluminal lesion is the main cause of symptoms, satisfactory local control could be obtained by re-ablation of the mucosal lesion every few years. Lesions requiring retreatment within 1 year after initial treatment usually have high-grade malignancy, causing extrinsic compression, and prognosis is unfavorable. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",English,0

Background: Metastatic disease to the spine causes significant pain in 75-90% of patients with advanced stage cancer. Quality of life is significantly affected and conventional treatment strategies with analgesia, chemo and radiopharmaceutical therapy, and surgery have more recently been supplemented by percutaneous ablation and augmentation. Isolated cemento-plasty, radiofrequency ablation, and combined RF ablation, cementoplasty and cryotherapy are well described strategies with recent feasibility studies on microwave ablation being reported. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: This exhibit will report our institution's experience in treating vertebral body metastatic disease with thermal ablation via both radiofrequency (RF) and microwave (MW) energy, in conjunction with kyphoplasty. Retrospective review over the past 1 year includes 14 patients in which a total of 16 ablations were performed, spanning from T3 to L5. 13 RF ablations and 3 MW ablations were performed. Primary tumors included hepatocellular, prostate, colorectal, renal, multiple myeloma, bladder, and lung (both small cell and NSCLC).Nocomplicationsrelatedtoablationwithaug-mentation have occurred to date. All patients experienced relief of pain. This exhibit will highlight the techniques and parameters used in various patients, as well as imaging and clinical follow-up.

Journal Article,V. Vadlamudi; M. Savin,2013,Utilization of adjunctive techniques for percutaneous ablation of hepatic tumors,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2010.04.029,"Purpose: Percutaneous ablation of hepatic tumors has emerged as a viable therapeutic option for patients who may have limited alternatives. Careful planning and attention is necessary to avoid injury to adjacent structures such as lung, stomach, colon, and the diaphragm. Various techniques have been described to protect surrounding organs, such as hydrodissection, balloon interposition, and C02 displacement; however, the rate of utilization of these adjunctive techniques has not been reported. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of patients with hepatic tumors treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), or irreversible electroporation (IRE) at a single institution from 2000-2012 was performed. Data collected included patient demographics, tumor type, number of tumors treated, type of ablation utilized, and number of ablations requiring adjunctive techniques including the techniques employed and the segmental location of the tumors and adjacent critical structures. Results: A total of 204 tumors were treated with percutaneous ablation in 100 patients (141 tumors with RFA, 63 tumors with MWA, and 2 tumors with IRE), with colorectal metastases and hepatocellular carcinoma being most common. Twenty-two tumors in 18 patients required adjunctive techniques for successful ablation. In 21 cases, hy-drodissection with D5W mixed with contrast was utilized and the remaining case required iatrogenic pneumothorax to displace the right lung from a tumor at the hepatic dome. In one additional patient, hydrodissection was performed but not successful in displacing segment 3 tumors from the stomach. The most common locations for tumors requiring adjunctive techniques for successful ablation were segments 2, 3, and 8 and the most common adjacent structures requiring protection were the colon, stomach, and duodenum. Conclusion: Adjunctive techniques were utilized in 10.8 of percutaneous hepatic tumor ablations, with hydrodissection employed most commonly. Although utilized in a minority of ablations, the use of these adjunctive techniques to protect surrounding organs allows interventional radiologists to safely perform percutaneous ablation of liver tumors which would not have been otherwise possible.",English,0

The development of endoscopic ultrasonography guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) is today regarded as an integral part of the EUS examination in specific clinical situations and can be performed in most lesions outlined by EUS with a sensitivity between 80-95%. Both lesions in the gastrointestinal wall itself as well as lesions lying adjacent to the wall may be punctured either through the esophagus, stomach, duodenum or transrectally. Several studies have reported on EUS guided biopsy from mucosal and submucosal tumors in the upper GI tract, mediastinal tumors including lung cancers , pancreatic tumors and lymph nodes in the mediastinum, upper retroperitoneum and upper peritoneum, lesions in the left liver lobe and left adrenal as well as tumors and lymph nodes para-rectally. Endoscopes with large instrument channels, have become available enabling direct EUS monitoring of procedures with other accessories than fine needles. This has resulted in the possibility to perform therapeutic interventions directly guided by EUS. Although EUS guided therapy is at its very early stage, the developments on the instrumental side holds a potential for advanced therapeutic interventions to be performed. Examples of EUS guided therapy are: EUS guided rende- vous procedures with ERCP, pancreatic pseudo-cyst drainage and stenting, EUS guided abscess drainage, EUS guided cholangiodrainage, celiac plexus nerve block in patients with pain of pancreatic origin, EUS guided injection of vessels such as oesophageal varices and local vascular malformations and botox injection in patients with achalasia. Future applications of EUS guided therapy may include HIFU, photodynamic therapy, microwave ablation and injection of cytotoxica or genemanipulated cells into pancreatic tumors. Most of the latter have already been discribed in animals or in human phase I trials.

Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents 90% of kidney cancers and 30% of people affected present with metastatic disease. The following sites may show metastases: lung (50-60%); bone (30-40%); liver (30-40%); adrenal gland, contralateral kidney, retroperitoneum, and brain (5% each). Different approaches can be proposed for the treatment of metastatic kidney tumours like surgery, systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, image-guided interventional methods, which are divided into percutaneous ablation and transarterial chemoperfusion, embolization and chemoembolization. Clinical Findings/Procedure Details: The current role of interventional radiology consists of transarterial embolization, chemoembolization (TACE) and percutaneous ablation procedures. Radical surgical treatment is limited by the high risk of extensive intraoperative blood loss. Preoperative embolization of bone metastases with subsequent complete devascularization leads to significant reduction of blood loss during surgery. In liver metastases TACE was performed. Partial response was achieved in 13.7%, stable disease in 59% and progressive disease in 27.3% of patients. Percutaneous ablation procedures, which consist in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA), can be performed as palliative or curative treatment. The survival of patients who received a curative lung RFA was 100%, those who received a palliative lung RFA was 52%. RFA is feasible for metastatic lesion at the pancreas located at the body-tail portion of the gland. RFA treatment of the adrenal gland can be performed with minimal morbidity. Conclusion: In patients non-suitable for surgery, the alternative approaches achieved a favorable local tumor response and increase of survival rate.",English,0

Methods: Liver-directed therapies are classified into vascular transarterial techniques such as chemoperfusion (TACP), chemoembolization (TACE), radioembolization (selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT)), and chemosaturation, as well as thermal ablation techniques like microwave ablation (MWA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT), cryotherapy, and irreversible electroporation (IRE). The authors searched the database PubMed using the following terms: 'image-guided tumor ablation', 'thermal ablation therapies', 'liver metastases of uveal melanoma', 'neuroendocrine carcinoma', 'breast cancer', and 'non-colorectal liver metastases'. Results: Various combinations of the above-mentioned therapy protocols are possible. In neuroendocrine carcinomas, oligonodular liver metastases are treated successfully via thermal ablation like RFA, LITT, or MWA, and diffuse involvement via TACE or SIRT. Although liver involvement in breast cancer is a systemic disease, non-responding nodular metastases can be controlled via RFA or LITT. In ocular or cutaneous melanoma, thermal ablation is rarely considered as an interventional treatment option, as opposed to TACE, SIRT, or chemosaturation. Rarely liver-directed therapies are used in pancreatic cancer, most likely due to problems such as biliary digestive communications after surgery and the risk of infections. Rare indications for thermal ablation are liver metastases of other primary cancers like non-small cell lung, gastric, and ovarian cancer. Conclusion: Interventional oncological techniques play a role in patients with liver-dominant metastases.",English,0

Zangos,2013,Thermal ablation therapies in patients with breast cancer liver metastases: A review,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00330-012-2662-4,"Background: The liver is involved in about half of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Unfortunately systemic chemotherapy as the treatment of choice is limited. Due to multifocality and/or insufficient remnant liver volume, the majority of liver metastases are also unresectable. Currently, thermal ablations are used in these patients with acceptable impact. Methods: We reviewed studies on radiofrequency ablation (RFA), laser-induced thermotherapy (LITT) and microwave ablation (MWA) regarding local tumour response, progression and survival indexes in patients with breast cancer liver metastases (BCLM). Results: The reviewed literature showed positive response rates of 63 % to 97 % in RF-ablated lesions, 98.2 % in LITT-treated lesions and 34.5-62.5 % in MW-ablated lesions. Median survival was 10.9-60 months using RFA, 51-54 months after LITT and 41.8 months using MWA. Five-year survival rates were 27-30 %, 35 % and 29 %, respectively. Local tumour progression ranged from 13.5 % to 58 % using RFA, 2.9 % with LITT and 9.6 % with MWA. Conclusion: The reviewed literature demonstrated that ablation therapies either as single therapy or combined with other locoregional therapies are a good alternative as an adjunction to resection in patients with resectable lesions or with positive response using chemotherapy. However, multicentre randomised studies should be conducted to obtain further evidence of the benefits of these treatments in patients with BCLM.

The study included 130 ablation sessions for lung tumors in 85 patients (35 males, 50 females; mean age 58.9 years, SD: 12.1) in the time period between December 2007 and July 2009. Tumor pathology was: 6 primary (nonsmall cell lung carcinoma) and 124 pulmonary metastases (from colorectal ca, breast ca, hepatocellular ca, prostatic ca and renal cell ca). The exclusion criteria of the ablation therapy were patients with lesions of maximal diameter more than 5 cm, or more than 5 in number and coagulopathy. Percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation was performed under CT fluoroscopy guidance. Tumor criteria, response and post ablation complications were assessed. Mixed linear modeling and logistic regression were performed. Results: The preablation tumors volume ranges 0.26-5.29 cc (mean 1.75 cc, SD 1.59) and mean of largest axial diameter 2.1 cm (0.5-5 cm, SD: 1.2).

Materials and Methods: All patients provided informed consent for this prospective institutional review board-approved study. Eighty patients (30 men, 50 women; mean age, 59.7 years +/- 6.4; range, 48-68 years) underwent computed tomography- guided percutaneous microwave ablation of pulmonary metastatic lesions in 130 sessions. The tumors represented metastases from colorectal carcinoma, breast carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and bronchogenic carcinoma; there was no evidence of extrapulmonary metastasis for any tumor. Logistic regression analysis was used for evaluation of the statistical signifi cance of factors affecting the end result of microwave ablation therapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimation of survival rates. Results: Complete, successful ablation was achieved in 95 (73.1%) of 130 lesions. Successful tumor ablation was significantly more frequent for lesions with a maximal axial diameter of 3 cm or smaller (90 of 110) than for lesions greater than 3 cm in maximal axial diameter (five of 20)(P<.0001) and for peripheral lesions (80 [80%] of 100) than for centrally located lesions (15 [50%] of 30)(P =.002). The histopathologic type of the metastasis did not significantly correlate with the ablation result(P>.3). The 12- and 24-month survival rates were 91.3% and 75%, respectively. There was no intraprocedural death, and the overall 60-day mortality rate after ablation was 0%. Higher survival rates were observed in patients with tumor-free states after successful ablation than in patients with failed ablation(P =.001). The incidence of pneumothorax was 8.5% (11 of 130).

[German],http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00761-014-2669-3,"Objectives. To present interventional oncological therapy concepts for lung and liver metastases. Material and methods. The different treatment techniques in interventional oncology are presented and include thermal ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), laser ablation (LITT), irreversible electroporation (IRE) and cryotherapy. Furthermore, vascular therapy methods are presented, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), transarterial chemoperfusion (TACP), drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE), selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT), transpulmonary chemoembolization (TPCE) and chemosaturation. Results. The interventional treatment techniques, such as RFA, MWA und LITT offer patients, especially those with nonresectable liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma, an effective therapy option if there are no more than 5 metastases <3 cm in size. Further vascular treatment techniques for liver metastases are integrated in a multimodal approach. This is especially true for SIRT and TACE as a palliative therapy concept in chemotherapy-resistant intrahepatic metastases. For lung metastases the indications for thermal ablation are 3 lung metastases up to 3 cm in diameter per lobe. Here as well the patient is normally in a nonresectable situation and there is no response to systemic chemotherapy. Discussion. Currently the multimodal approach in liver and lung metastases from colorectal carcinoma needs to be discussed also regarding interventional treatment options. These are either treatment techniques which are strictly localized to the tumor, such as thermal ablation or they are vascular treatment techniques which allow treatment of larger tumor areas or larger tumor volumes. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",German,0

Time to local tumor progression was monitored on CT scans over the follow-up period. Estimation of overall time to local tumor progression was performed with the Cox regression model. Factors hypothesized to correlate with ablation response included tumor diameter, tumor shape (round or oval versus irregular), clear versus ill-defined tumor margin, adjacency to the pleura, adjacency to bronchi, presence of vessels at least 3 mm in diameter a maximum of 5 mm from the index tumor, energy applied to the index tumor, and the occurrence of cavernous formations after ablation. A logistic regression model was used to correlate the data. RESULTS. Thirty of 91 (33.0%) index tumors, found in 21 of 57 (36.8%) patients, underwent local progression. The mean time to local tumor progression was 8.3 +/- 5.5 months (range 2.1-25.2 months), and the estimated median time to local tumor progression was 22.6 +/- 12.4 months. The risk factors that correlated significantly with local tumor progression were a maximal diameter greater than 15.5 mm (p < 0.01), irregular shape of the index tumor (p < 0.01), pleural contact (p = 0.02), and less than 26.7 J/mm3 applied to the index tumor (p < 0.001). After regression analysis, shape of the index tumor (p = 0.03) and energy deployed per unit volume of the index tumor (p = 0.001) were found to be independent risk factors. Conversely, tumor margin definition (p = 0.06) and proximity of cavernous formations (p = 0.19), juxtatumoral vessels (p = 0.08), and bronchi (p = 0.89) did not affect tumor progression after ablation. CONCLUSION. The independent predictive factors for local tumor progression in primary and secondary lung neoplasms up to 3 cm in diameter observed in this study were irregular shape of the index tumor and energy application of less than 26.7 J/mm3 to the index tumor. © American Roentgen Ray Socoety.",English,0

Moche,2016,The development of a simulation tool for clinical use in image guided percutaneous minimally invasive cancer treatment (MICT)-the GoSmart project,http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000444354,"Background: There are several common methods of image guided minimally invasive cancer treatment (MICT) including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), cryoablation, brachytherapy or irreversible electroporation. However, there is no common software environment to plan and to predict the results from different types of MICT. The GoSmart project therefore develops an intervention planning system for assisting radiologists to choose the best patient specific approach in MICT. Evaluation: GoSmart aims to create a web based open ended software to assist interventionalists to plan a patient specific procedure and to also train within an augmented reality simulation environment. The project includes the development of dedicated tools for patient specific 3D-modelling of liver, kidney and lung from CT or MRI data. New tissue heat transfer and cell death mathematical models are integrated into a finite element model based computer simulation code. This tool will help clinicians for better planning MICTs and predicting the induced tissue lesion. The results of the tools will be validated by comparing simulations with the real patient treatment results. Results: Yet a prototype interface with possibility to plan and simulate different MICT has been developed successfully and can be tested. Furthermore an international external user forum has been set up to spread the concept to a larger group of clinicians and researchers. Conclusion: The finalized IMPPACT project showed encouraging results for the simulation of RFA induced liver lesions. During IMPPACT a user survey among German interventional radiologists demonstrated the request of computer assistance for percutaneous MICT procedures. GoSmart proposes practical support for MICT of the liver, kidney and lung providing a powerful tool for interventional radiologists for best personalized approach in MICT. It will also allow cross validation of different MICT types. Furthermore the unification of different MICT types into a common simulation environment helps implementing standardized benchmarks and protocols for MICT.",English,0

Methods The clinicopathological data of 693 patients with primary liver cancer who underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous cooled-tip microwave (MW) ablation in our hospital over the past 5 years were retrospectively analyzed, and the risk factors of severe complications were explored. Results In a total of 693 [wtients with 898 primary liver tumors were treated and 1111 MW ablation sessions were performed. The mean diameter of tumors was (2.5 +/- 1.2) cm and the range was 0.4-10.0 cm.

Schoppmeyer,2013,Radiofrequency (thermal) ablation versus no intervention or other interventions for hepatocellular carcinoma,10.1002/14651858.CD003046.pub3,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Percutaneous interventional therapies, such as radiofrequency (thermal) ablation (RFA), have been developed for early hepatocellular carcinoma. RFA competes with other interventional techniques such as percutaneous ethanol injection, surgical resection, and liver transplantation. The potential benefits and harms of RFA compared with placebo, no intervention, chemotherapy, hepatic resection, liver transplantation, or other interventions are unclear.Objectives: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of RFA versus placebo, no intervention, or any other therapeutic approach in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science to September 2012. We handsearched meeting abstracts from ASCO, ESMO, AASLD, EASL, APASL, and references of articles. We also contacted researchers in the field (last search September 2012).Selection criteria: We considered for inclusion randomised clinical trials investigating the effects of RFA versus placebo, no intervention, or any other therapeutic approach on hepatocellular carcinoma patients regardless of blinding, language, and publication status.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed the selection of trials, assessment of risk of bias, and data extraction. We contacted principal investigators for missing information. We analysed hazard ratios (HR) as relevant effect measures for overall survival, two-year survival, event-free survival, and local recurrences with 95% confidence intervals (CI). In addition, we analysed dichotomous survival outcomes using risk ratios (RR). We used trial sequential analysis to control the risk of random errors ('play of chance').Main results: We identified no trials comparing RFA versus placebo, no intervention, or liver transplantation. We identified and included 11 randomised clinical trials with 1819 participants that included four comparisons: RFA versus hepatic resection (three trials, 578 participants); RFA versus percutaneous ethanol injection (six trials, 1088 participants) including one three-armed trial that also investigated RFA versus acetic acid injection; RFA versus microwave ablation (one trial, 72 participants); and RFA versus laser ablation (one trial, 81 participants). Ten of the eleven included trials reported on the primary outcome of this review, overall survival. Rates of major complications or procedure-related deaths were reported in 10 trials. The overall risk of bias was considered low in five trials and high in six trials. For a subgroup analysis, we included only low risk of bias trials. Regarding the comparison RFA versus hepatic resection, there was moderate-quality evidence from two low risk of bias trials that hepatic resection seems more effective than RFA regarding overall survival (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.78) and two-year survival (HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.84). However, if we included a third trial with high risk of bias, the difference became insignificant (overall survival: HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.15). With regards to the outcomes event-free survival and local progression, hepatic resection also yielded better results than RFA. However, the number of complications was higher in surgically treated participants (odds ratio (OR) 8.24; 95% CI 2.12 to 31.95). RFA seemed superior to percutaneous ethanol or acetic acid injection regarding overall survival (HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.07). The RR for mortality was also in favour of RFA, but did not reach statistical significance (150/490 (30.6%) people in the percutaneous ethanol or acetic acid group versus 119/496 (24.0%) people in the RFA group; RR 1.76; 95% CI 0.97 to 3.22). The proportion of adverse events did not differ significantly between RFA and percutaneous ethanol or acetic acid injection (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.48). Trial sequential analyses revealed that the number of articipants in the included trials was insufficient and that more trials are needed to assess the effects of RFA versus other interventions.Authors' conclusions: The effects of RFA versus no intervention, chemotherapeutic treatment, or liver transplantation are unknown. We found moderate-quality evidence that hepatic resection is superior to RFA regarding survival. However, RFA might be associated with fewer complications and a shorter hospital stay than hepatic resection. We found moderate-quality evidence showing that RFA seems superior to percutaneous ethanol injection regarding survival. There were too sparse data to recommend or refute ablation achieved by techniques other than RFA. More randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias and low risks of random errors assessing the effect of RFA are needed.",,0

A small percentage of patients maybe amenable to surgical resection or ablation once the biology of the disease and the burden of hepatic disease are better understood. The use of hepatic arterial resin microspheres containing the beta emitter, yttrium-90, has been reported in the treatment of unresectable hepatic metastases. The goal of this review was to evaluate the use of yttrium-90 hepatic arterial therapy in the management of hepatic metastases and surgical downstaging. METHODS: We reviewed our prospective hepatic arterial therapy registry and found 44 patients who had received Sir Sphere treatment for unresectable hepatic malignancies from 11/06 to 7/08. Response was assessed by using CT-imaging and characterized using modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). All patients were managed in a multidisciplinary tertiary referral center specializing in hepatic malignancies. RESULTS: A total of 44 patients, 34 men and 10 women, with a median age of 60 y (range 44-8), received 67 treatments. The disease types treated were one adenosquamous tongue, one adrenal, nine carcinoid, three cholangiocarcinoma, four esophageal, one gastric, one gastrinoma, one GIST, four HCC, 15 colorectal, one melanoma, one non-small-cell lung, one occular, and one sarcoma. Four patients treated proceeded to resection because of downstaging of disease or no evidence of extrahepatic progression. The median age in these patients was 61 y (range 49-62). All of the patients had less than 25% tumor burden in the liver. Surgical therapy consisted of two patients undergoing right hepatic lobectomy, one patient who also underwent two wedge resections of segment 3, and one patient who had a left lateral hepatectomy with right lobe microwave ablation. The median length of postoperative stay was 7 d. There was no evidence of liver dysfunction following resection in any of the patients. None of the patients show evidence of recurrence in the liver following resection. One patient has had progression of disease in the lungs following resection, histologically confirmed as metastatic rectal carcinoma. All of the patients are currently alive with a median survival of 2 y. CONCLUSION: Hepatic directed yttrium-90 is a minimally invasive, highly effective therapy that can be utilized to downstage the hepatic burden and/or assess the biology of the disease to allow for appropriate treatment. The use of yttrium-90 microspheres for radio-embolization of metastases in the liver can successfully downstage the lesions to allow for surgical resection in patients with amenable predictors, and can provide a significantly better prognosis in these patients. This form of therapy for the purposes of downstaging tumors for resection merits more extensive study in order to provide the best possible outcomes for patients with metastatic liver disease.",eng,0

Journal Article,R. Winokur; B. B. Pua; A. Talenfeld; D. Madoff,2013,Characterization of in vivo ablation cavities following percutaneous microwave ablation of the liver,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2013.01.101,"Purpose: Percutaneous microwave ablation is rapidly developing as a minimally invasive technique for treating patients with isolated malignancy in the liver. Currently, pre-procedure planning is relegated to utilization of ablation zones obtained from ex-vivo livers and porcine in vivo models. Recent data suggests that the performance in human tumors can be expected to be somewhere between the performance seen in ex vivo and in vivo normal porcine livers. The goal of the current study is to analyze the experience with microwave ablation in the liver to better estimate the ablation cavity. Materials and Methods: Percutaneous microwave ablations performed on the liver between June 2011 and October 2012 were included. Preprocedure and immediate postablation CT scans were analyzed. The ablation cavities were compared to necrosis tables published by HS Medical and Neuwave Medical. Results: Percutaneous microwave ablation was performed on 22 patients and 27 lesions between June 2011 and October. Fourteen patients were diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, three with colorectal carcinoma metastasis, two with gastroesophageal carcinoma metastasis, one with renal cell carcinoma metastasis, one with lung carcinoma metastasis, and one with breast carcinoma metastasis. Four patients were treated with Neuwave Medical ablation probes and 18 patients were treated with HS Medical Amica probes. The size of the ablation cavity was found to be smaller than the reported values in ex vivo room temperature porcine livers regardless of primary diagnosis. The most frequently used settings for ablation was 60 watts for 10 minutes, which resulted in an average ablation cavity of 43.4 x 24.6 mm compared to reported values of 54 x 40 mm. Conclusion: Although necrosis tables were published by the manufacturers of percutaneous microwave ablation equipment, the values are based upon room temperature normal porcine livers, which are highly inaccurate for procedural planning in humans. This study shows that the ablation cavity in patients are smaller than the reported values. A more accurate estimate of ablation cavity size and geometry will allow for better procedural planning and more effective tumor ablation.",English,0

Materials and Methods: From 1999-2008, 26 patients underwent percutaneous RF, MW, or cryoablation of 28 tumors. A total of 16 men and 10 women (average age, 60 yrs; range, 35-84 yrs) underwent 30 ablation sessions (23 radiofrequency, 6 microwave, and 1 cryoablation) with an average of 2.9 applications per tumor (range, 1-7 applications). Tumors included 2 pheochromoctyomas, 1 paraganglioma, 1 aldosteronoma, 2 recurrent adrenal cortical carcinomas and 20 metastases (bilateral in 2). Primaries included HCC (1), endometrial (1), renal cell (7), lung (8), melanoma (2) and small bowel (1). Size ranged from 1.0 -8.5cm with a mean diameter of 4.3cm. Successful treatment was defined as a lack of enhancement or uptake within the treated region on follow-up CT and FDG PET-CT studies and/or resolution of biochemical abnormalities. Results: 24/28 (86%) tumors were successfully ablated in one session. Residual disease was retreated in 3 tumors. Recurrent disease at the ablation site was noted in 3 patients with an average 48.7 months to first recurrence (range, 26-91.2 months). Pathologically-proven local recurrence occurred in the case of the aldosteronoma, 91.2 months after initial ablation and in 2 patients with metastatic disease. Intra-ablative hypertension requiring pharmacologic intervention occurred in 4 of 30 (13%) treatment sessions. Of the 20 patients with metastatic disease, 17 had progression of metastatic disease at extra-adrenal sites leading to death, and 3 remain alive. The 3 other hormonally active tumors are inactive. Collectively, an analysis of all-cause mortality within the 26 patients results in a median survival of 1.15 years (CI 0.52-3.08).

Liver transplantation (LT) has become a curative treatment for patients with HCC. However, recurrence and metastasis after LT are the main factors reducing long-term survival in patients, and the lung is the most common site of metastasis after LT for HCC, although metastasis to liver, para-aortic lymph nodes and renal periphery are observed. Thus, the treatment of pulmonary metastases after LT for HCC has become a hot research topic, the successful treatment of pulmonary metastases can significantly prolong the survival of LT patients. Although single conventional treatment (chemotherapy, surgery and external beam radiation therapy), immunosuppression, image-guided minimally invasive therapy (radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, cryoablation, and brachytherapy) and molecular targeted drugs have had a significant effect, patients do not have durable remission and the long-term survival rate is disappointing. Therefore, improving existing treatments and identifying a more effective combination therapy are important research issues in the prevention and treatment of pulmonary metastases after LT for HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 1995 and September 2002, 358 patients with 455 liver tumors underwent a total of 683 ablation procedures, such as percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), percutaneous microwave coagulation (PMC), and radiofrequency (RF) ablation therapy. With a retrospective review of medical records, the rates and outcomes of cholangitis and/or liver abscess occurring after ablation therapy were evaluated. The relationship between cholangitis and/or liver abscess and multiple variables (age, disease, Child-Pugh class, size of nodules, multiplicity of nodules, history of transcatheter arterial embolization, presence of bilioenteric anastomosis, and lack of prophylactic antibiotics administration) were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Cholangitis and/or liver abscess occurred in 10 sessions (1.5%) in 10 patients: six sessions after PEI, three sessions after PMC, and one session after RF ablation. Both cholangitis and liver abscess were noted in seven sessions, cholangitis was noted in two, and liver abscess was noted in one. Six patients recovered, but two developed recurrent cholangitis and liver abscess, one developed lung abscess complicated with liver abscess, and one died of septic shock associated with cholangitis. On stepwise regression analysis, bilioenteric anastomosis was the sole significant predictor of cholangitis and/or liver abscess formation (P < .001; odds ratio = 36.4; 95% CI = 9.67-136.9). CONCLUSION: Bilioenteric anastomosis strongly correlated with the development of cholangitis and/or liver abscess after percutaneous ablation therapy. Close posttreatment attention should be paid to this subgroup of patients.",English,0

Fujie,2011,Thermal conductivity and temperature distribution during radio frequency ablation of lung,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11548-011-0581-5,"Purpose: RFA is an important method for treating tumors and has increasingly been used over the past few years. RFA involves an electrode being percutaneously introduced into the tumor and RF energy being applied, whereupon the temperature of the tissue rises due to the ionic agitation generated by the microwaves at 470 kHz. Tissue coagulation occurs as a result of protein denaturation when the tissue around the electrode reaches a temperature of around 60degreeC. Subsequently, moisture evaporation occurs and the tumors become completely necrotic at 70-80degreeC. A characteristic of RFA for lungs is that these organs contain abundant air. Air is low thermal conductivity. Therefore, the internal air focuses the RF energy from an electrode onto a limited region. Thus the lung is more suitable for cauterization than breasts, livers, bones [1]. However, excessive ablation or non-ablation of tumors has been reported. We propose a method using numerical simulation to analyze the temperature distribution of the organ in order to overcome the current deficiencies. Creating an accurate thermophysical model was a challenging problem because of the complexities of the thermophysical properties of the organ. In this work, as the processes of the development of ablation simulator for lung cancer, experiment to measure the pressure dependence of lung thermal conductivity and temperature distribution during RFA is presented. Methods: (1) First, we measured the thermal conductivity when air is contained in the lung. Using the pressure control machine which we developed and thermal conductivity measurement machine, we obtained the thermal conductivity of hog lung with changing lung internal pressure. The thermal conductivity measurement machine is consisted of a needle-type sensing unit and a main calculation unit. In the experiment, the needle type sensing unit was inserted into the distal portion of the hog lung with a certain volume of lung parenchyma. Then, the thermal conductivity of isolated lung was obtained based on unsteady hot wire method from approximately 0-3.0 kPa. 3.0 kPa is the maximum pressure achieved during human breathing [2]. (2) Next, we measured the temperature distribution of lung during RFA. Using RF generator (radionics) and the thermo-couples, we measured the temperature of two individual left hog lungs at three different internal pressure, respectively. RF generator is consists of an RF electrode and a control unit to modulate the radio wave. The three thermo-couples were arranged parallel with the RF electrode at 5 mm intervals, and were able to measure the temperature to a maximum of 15 mm distance from the RF electrode. Temperature distribution was measured at three internal lung pressures, namely 2.0, 1.0 and 0 kPa. The current of radio wave was adjusted until the voltage reached a constant 60 V. RFA for lung cancer creates a distal portion area with a diameter of about 30 mm. As a consequence, we set the temperature measurement region to less than a diameter of 30 mm from the RF electrode. Table 1 shows the experimental conditions at each lung pressure during RFA. Results: (1) We found that the thermal conductivity of the lung decreased linearly within the pressure range 0-2.0 kPa, and was constant within the range 2.0-3.0 kPa. Via the experimental data, the relationship between pressure P<inf>lung</inf> [kPa] and thermal conductivity lambda<inf>Air</inf> [W/mK] was modeled as Eqs. 1 and 2. (2) The results of temperature distribution measurements are shown in Fig. 1. The thermal conductivity at a lung pressure of 2.0 kPa was about 0.125 W/mK, and was about 0.200 W/mK at 0 kPa. Thus, the thermal conductivity at 2.0 kPa was less than about 40% of its value at 0 kPa. On the other hand, the cautery time at 2.0 kPa was 80 s, and at 0 kPa it was 500 s. In the light of lung thermal conductivity, a cautery time at 2.0 kPa would have been about (Table Presented) (Figure Presented) 300 s, which is less than about 40% of the cautery time at 0 kPa. Actually, the cautery time at 2.0 kPa was not 40%, but less than 20% as compared with its value at 0 kPa. It seems that this difference is related to the internal pressure dependence of electrical resistance of the lungs. It was suggested that the factor involved in focusing heat on a limited region is not only lung thermal conductivity but also lung electric resistivity. lambda<inf>Air</inf> = -8:8 x 10<sup>-2</sup> P<inf>lung</inf> + 1:8 x 10<sup>-1</sup> (P<inf>lung</inf> < 2:0 kPa) (1) lambda<inf>Air</inf> = 0:125 (P<inf>lung</inf> > 2:0 kPa) (2) Conclusion: In this paper, we presented the data concerning the dependence of thermal conductivity on lung internal pressure using the unsteady hot wire method. Moreover, we measured temperature distribution of hog lung at three internal pressures. From the experiments, it was suggested that lung internal air had an effect on heat transfer. Heat was focused due to increasing lung electric resistivity as a result of increasing the internal lung pressure. Therefore, it is suggested that both lung thermal conductivity and electric resistivity are important factors with regard to RF ablation in the lung. In the future, more detailed validations of the dependence of thermo and electric physical properties on lung internal pressure will be necessary. At the same time, as we will carry out additional studies on lung properties, we will further develop the thermal distribution simulator. The planning and navigation system will also be further developed to enable its use in safe and precise clinical RFA treatment for lung tumors.",English,0

Consecutive patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated between 2003 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Propensity score matching was used to create comparable palliative local treatment and chemotherapy alone groups (n = 272 in each group). The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Factors possibly influencing survival were evaluated by univariate and subsequently by multivariate analyses. Palliative local treatment prolonged survival as compared with chemotherapy alone (38.73 vs. 19.8 months, p < 0.01). Univariate and subsequent multivariate analyses showed that primary stage IV at initial diagnosis; high CA199 level and LDH at the time of diagnosis were independent factors for a poor prognosis. Palliative local treatment improved survival better than chemotherapy alone in patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the prognostic factors (p < 0.01). Patients administered treatment for pulmonary metastases survived longer than those treated for metastases elsewhere (56.77 vs. 35.43 months, p = 0.01). Surgical treatment provided marginally longer survival than non-surgical treatment (44.87 vs. 35.43 months, p = 0.05).

However, the value of noncurative locoregional therapy for unresectable metastatic colorectal carcer was not well defined. Methods: Of 1,174 patients with unresectable colorectal cancer from 2003 to 2014 retrospectively reviewed, 62 patients received curative regional treatment, 290 patients received locoregional therapy, and 822 patients received standard chemotherapy. Propensity score matching was used to adjust the balance of baseline data between locoregional therapy arm and chemotherapy arm. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were based on data after propensity score matching. Factors possibly influencing survival were evaluated by univariate and subsequently by multivariate analyses. Results: After propensity score matching, 544 patients were included in this study, 272 in locoregional therapy arm and 272 in chemotherapy arm, respectively. Locoregional therapy included metastasectomy, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy and radioactive particle implantation. The addition of locoregional therapy to chemotherapy significantly improved the overall survival with median overall survival 38.73 months (95%CI 34.93-42.54 months) in locoregional therapy arm versus 19.8 months (95%CI 18.06-21.54 months) in chemotherapy arm, respectively, p<0.001. 9 factors were associated with overall survival by univariate analysis, which include primary tumor site, initial stage at first diagnosis, pathological grading, target organ of regional treatment, CA199 and LDH at diagnosis of advanced disease, CEA, CA199 and LDH before regional treatment. Furthermore, CEA (>5ng/ml) and LDH (>245U/L) before regional treatment were identified as independent poor prognostic factors by multivariate analysis. Median overall survival according to the presence of 0, 1, or 2 factors was 49.4 months, 35.7 months, and 27 months. Conclusions: Unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer also benefited from locoregional therapy. Two pre-locoregional treatment risk factors could select the patients most likely to benefit from this strategy.",English,0

The present study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of percutaneous thermal ablation with curative intention for HCC measuring between 3.0 cm and 7.0 cm. METHODS: Percutaneous RFA or MWA were used to treat 109 HCC patients with at least 1 tumor measuring between 3.0 cm and 7.0 cm. fifty-eight patients received thermal ablation as the first treatment, and the remaining 51 were treated for posthepatectomy recurrent HCC. A total of 89 patients had a main tumor measuring 3.0 cm to 5.0 cm, and 20 patients had main tumors measuring 5.0 cm to 7.0 cm. Local therapeutic efficacy, long-term outcome, and prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS: There were no treatment-related deaths, and the major complication rate was 9.2%. Complete ablation rate was 92.6%. Local recurrence (LR) occurred in 22% patients, with a median time to LR of 4.6 months. Distant recurrences developed in 53.2% patients. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 75.8%, 30.9%, and 15.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis indicated that incomplete tumor ablation, posthepatectomy recurrence, and preablation alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) >200 ng/mL were 3 unfavorable prognostic factors for long-term survival (P=.000,.015, and.008, respectively). Cox regression analysis confirmed that incomplete tumor ablation, recurrent tumors, and preablation AFP >200 ng/mL were independent unfavorable prognostic factors, with an exp(B) of 4.158 (P=.001), 1.568 (P=.082), and 1.593 (P=.082), respectively.

Hepatectomy was not done in all cases. Microwave coagulation therapy was done with sonographically guide percutaneous insertion of a needle-electrode (P-MCT). Treated metastatic liver nodules were under 3 cm in diameter. Primary lesions were treated by radical excision. P-MCT was repeated 5 to 6 times to treat one nodule. Six of 10 patients had metachronous liver metastasis. Liver tumors were detected at 4-to 8-month intervals. Whenever a nodule was detected, P-MCT was performed. In 3 of 6 patients there were no signs of recurrence after 12 to 42 months of follow up, including no elevation in CEA levels. Achieving a recurrence-free state in 3 patients with metachronous metastatic liver cancers was the best indication of P-MCT. But multiple liver metastases were found in another two patients who had received P-MCT. In these two patients, P-MCT was not indicated, chemotherapy was also done. Another 4 patients had synchronous liver metastasis. Intraoperative microwave coagulation therapy or enucleation of hepatic tumor was done at primary operation. All patients were alive without recurrence of hepatic tumor but with high CEA levels. One patient was found to have a lung metastasis 18 months after primary operation. Chemotherapy was used to treat these 4 patients.

Towards thyroid nodules, only a few cases are reported so far. The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave ablation in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules with a large sample. Materials and methods: A total of 477 benign thyroid nodules in 222 patients underwent microwave ablation in our department from July 2009 to March 2012. Microwave ablation was carried out using microwave antenna (16G) under local anesthesia. Nodule volume, thyroid function and clinical symptoms were evaluated before treatment and at 1, 3, more than 6 months. The study was ethics committee approved and written informed consents were obtained from all patients. Results: All thyroid nodules significantly decreased in size after microwave ablation. A 6-month follow-up was achieved in 254 of 477 nodules, and the mean decrease in the volume of thyroid nodules was from 2.13 +/- 4.42 ml to 0.45 +/- 0.90 ml, with a mean percent decrease of 0.65 +/- 0.65. A volume-reduction ratio greater than 50% was observed in 82.3% (209/254) of index nodules, and 30.7% (78/254) of index nodules disappeared 6-month after the ablation. The treatment was well tolerated and no major complications were observed except pain and transient voice changes.

A future concept for local treatment in lung cancer,http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1183/13993003.congress2015.PA4291,"We investigated with seven groups of BALBC mice whether local treatment with DDMC-p53 with or without cisplatin and or microwave ablation enhances disease control. We used Lewis lung carcinoma cell line to inoculate 140 BALBC mice. The mice were divided into the followoing seven groups: a), control, b) cipslatin, c) microwave, d) DDMC-p53, e) DDMC-53 plus cisplatin, f) DDMC-p53 plus microwave and g) DDMC-p53 plus cisplatin plus microwave. Microwave ablation was administered at 20 watts for 10 minutes. Cisplatin administration was 1ml/mg and DDMC-p53 complex delivered was 0.5ml. Increased toxicity was observed in the group of DDMC-p53 plus cisplatin plus microwave following by the group of cisplatin plus microwave. Infection after repeated treatment administration was a major issue. We conclude that combination of gene therapy with DDMC-p53 with or without cisplatin and or microwave is an alternative method for local disease control, however; more experiments are required in a larger model to investigate the proper dosage profile.

Ackland,2012,Curative strategies for liver metastases from colorectal cancer: A review,http://dx.doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0300,"Colorectal cancer is a very common malignancy and frequently manifests with liver metastases, often without other systemic disease. Margin-negative (R0) resection of limited metastatic disease, in conjunction with systemic antineoplastic agents, is the primary treatment strategy, leading to long survival times for appropriately selected patients. There is debate over whether the primary tumor and secondaries should be removed at the same time or in a staged manner. Chemotherapy is effective in converting some unresectable liver metastases into resectable disease, with a correspondingly better survival outcome. However, the ideal chemotherapy with or without biological agents and when it should be administered in the course of treatment are uncertain. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in initially resectable liver metastases is controversial. Local delivery of chemotherapy, with and without surgery, can lead to longer disease-free survival times, but it is not routinely used with curative intent. This review focuses on methods to maximize the disease-free survival interval using chemotherapy, surgery, and local methods. ©AlphaMed Press.",English,0

Book,Anonymous,2014,Computed tomography-guided percutaneous microwave ablation for lung nodules,", http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/ShowRecord.asp?ID=32015000343","Estimates indicate that lung cancer will present in 224,210 new cases and will cause death in 159,260 individuals in 2014 in the United States. In this country, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women, accounting for approximately 29% of all cancer deaths. Additionally, pulmonary metastases may occur in numerous other cancer types. While the preferred treatment for early-stage lung cancer or limited pulmonary metastasis is surgical resection, many patients with these malignancies cannot endure surgical resection due to advanced age, poor cardiopulmonary function, or serious medical comorbidities. Furthermore, over half the patients with lung cancer have advanced inoperable disease at presentation. Recently, several minimally invasive tumor ablation techniques have been used for treating inoperable pulmonary malignancies. These techniques include image-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), laser ablation, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation, and, for tumors not accessible percutaneously, stereotactic ablative radiation therapy. For treating lung tumors, RFA has been the most widely used of these techniques and has demonstrated efficacy in local tumor control and patient survival. However, RFA in the lung is prone to cooling at the periphery of tumors due to the heat-sink effect caused by nearby blood flow and the high impedance and poor conductivity of heat caused by lung aeration. While producing higher temperatures may overcome these problems, it causes tissue charring. These technical challenges limit the ablation time, the size of the ablation zone, and the success in treating tumors > 3 centimeters (cm) in diameter. MWA may offer advantages over RFA because it deposits energy more quickly and in a broader zone than RFA, and heats tissue directly rather than by thermal conduction as occurs with RFA. These characteristics theoretically minimize the potential for heat sink and impedance, and allow longer ablation time and a larger ablation zone than RFA.",,1

This retrospective study was performed to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and follow-up imaging of MWA in the elderly aged 75 years and above. Methods Eleven percutaneous computed tomography (CT)-guided MWA of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were performed in 10 patients aged 75 years and older. All but one patient were treated with a high-powered MWA system delivering maximally 140 W. Follow-up with CT and fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was carried out over a maximum period of 30 months and a median period of 12 months. Results There were no peri-procedural deaths or major complications. Seven patients were disease free at the time of manuscript submission. Three patients showed growth of the treated lesions, one patient aged 90 years deceased due to unknown cause after approximately 18 months. One patient presented with local progression and disseminated metastatic disease at 12 months; he is still alive. One patient showed increasing soft tissue at the ablation site 15 months post-treatment. Three consecutive core biopsies over 2 months failed to confirm tumour recurrence. Conclusions MWA therapy is a promising option of treating early-stage NSCLC in the elderly with good treatment outcome and negligible morbidity. Determining successful treatment outcome may be challenging at times as local tissue increase and PET-CT positivity do not seem to necessarily correlate with reccurrence of malignancy.",English,1

Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant retrospective study. Study population was 163 patients treated with MWA and/or RFA for 195 lung neoplasms between February 2004 and April 2010. Follow-up computed tomographic images of at least 3 months were retrospectively reviewed by board-certified radiologists to determine the presence of rib fractures. Generalized estimating equations were performed to assess the effect that patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment parameters, and ablation zone characteristics had on development of rib fractures. Kaplan- Meier curve was used to estimate patients' probability of rib fracture after ablation as a function of time. Clinical parameters (ie, pain in ribs or chest, organ damage caused by fractured rib) were evaluated for patients with confirmed fracture. Results: Rib fractures in proximity to the ablation zone were found in 13.5% (22 of 163) of patients. Estimated probability of fracture was 9% at 1 year and 22% at 3 years. Women were more likely than were men to develop fracture after ablation (P = .041). Patients with tumors closer to the chest wall were more likely to develop fracture (P = .0009), as were patients with ablation zones that involved visceral pleura (P = .039). No patients with rib fractures that were apparently induced by RFA and MWA had organ injury or damage related to fracture, and 9.1% (2 of 22) of patients reported mild pain. Conclusion: Rib fractures were present in 13.5% of patients after percutaneous RFA and MWA of lung neoplasms. Patients who had ablations performed close to the chest wall should be monitored for rib fractures. © RSNA, 2012.",English,1

Cioffi,2013,Thermal ablation in the treatment of lung cancer: Present and future,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezs558,"Surgery is considered the best choice for stage I non-small cell lung cancer and also in treatment of selected patients with lung metastasis. However, surgery is often a high-risk procedure because of severe medical comorbidities affecting this cohort of patients. Thermal ablation (TA) has recently been proposed to achieve destruction of lung tumours whilst avoiding the use of general anaesthesia, thereby limiting the invasiveness of the procedure. For pulmonary malignancies, there are two methods of TA based on tissue heating: radio frequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). Both are mini-invasive procedures, delivering energy to the tumour through single or multiple percutaneous needles introduced under guidance of computed tomography. The procedure may be performed under conscious sedation or general anaesthesia to avoid pain caused by needle insertion and tissue heating. Local efficacy is directly correlated to tumour target size: for RFA, tumours smaller than 2 cm can be completed ablated in 78-96% of cases; for MWA -according to the largest available study-95% of initial ablations are reported to be successful for tumours smaller than 5 cm. Very few series provide survival data beyond 3 years. For nodules smaller than 3 cm, the registered survival rate is higher: 50% at five years. The data collected in the last 10 years allow us to conclude that TA is an established alternative treatment for patients who cannot undergo surgery because of their compromised general condition. In the case of pulmonary metastasis, most authors agree to offer TA only if lesions are smaller than 5 cm. © The Author 2012.

Materials and methods: All procedures were approved by the hospital ethical committee. From 2008 to 2012 we treated 69 unresectable lesions (44 lung cancer, 25 lung metastases) in 56 patients (35 men/21 women; mean age: 61.5 years). Treatment was performed under CT guidance using 14 G needles with a 3 cm active tip and a 55 W MW generator (Vivawave Microwave Coagulation System; Valley Lab). Treatment was performed at 45 W for 6-10 min. Patients were scheduled for a 3 and 6 month CT follow-up to evaluate lesion diameter and enhancement. Survival rate was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Ablation procedures were completed according to protocol in all patients. Pneumothorax occurred in 18 patients and 8 required chest tube. Four lesions (all >4.3 cm) were retreated 20 days after the ablation because of peripheral focal areas of residual tumor. Follow-up CT evaluation showed a decrease in maximum diameter in 44/69 lesions (64%) and in 42/59 lesions (71%) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. In all cases no pathologic enhancement was observed. Cancer-specific mortality yielded a survival rate of 69% at 12 months, 54% at 24 months and 49% at 36 months, respectively. An estimate mean for survival time was 27.8 months with a standard error of 2.8 months (95% confidence interval: 22.4-33.2 months). Conclusion: Based on our experience, MW ablation seems to represent a potential safe and effective percutaneous technique in the treatment of lung malignancies. MW ablation may improve survival in patients not suitable to surgery. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",English,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on patients who had received thermal ablation for recurrent NSCLC post-curative radiotherapy. Medical records and follow-up imaging with computed tomography (CT) and PET-CT were analysed to determine time to local progression (TTLP) and overall survival (OS). TTLP was determined according to the modified RECIST criteria. RESULTS: Twelve patients, mean age 71 +/- 7 years, received 17 thermal ablation sessions, with RFA performed for four lesions and MWA for 13. Nine tumours were squamous cell cancers (SCC) and eight were adenocarcinomas. Eleven tumours had recurred post-external beam radiation and one post-stereotactic body radiation therapy. Mean tumour size was 34.2 +/- 12.8 mm, tumour stages prior to radiotherapy were Ia (2), Ib (3), IIa (4), IIb (1) and III (2). Follow-up period was 19 +/- 11 months. Overall median TTLP was 14 months (95% CI: 8, 19), and median OS was 35 months (95% CI: 12, 58). Mean TTLP for tumours <30 mm was 23 months and for tumours >30 mm 14 months (p = 0.20). Recurrence rates reduced from 50% after initial ablation to 20% with a second ablation. Complication rate for pneumothorax requiring intervention was 17%.

Materials and Methods Thermal ablation treatment sessions performed with NR under CS or HFJV under GA with available anesthesia records and CT fluoroscopic images were retrospectively reviewed; 13 and 33 treatment sessions, respectively, were identified. One anesthesiologist determined the choice of anesthesiologic technique independently. Surrogate measures of procedure technical difficulty - time duration, number of CT fluoroscopic acquisitions, and radiation dose required for applicator placement for each tumor - were compared between anesthesiologic techniques. The anesthesiologist time and complications were also compared. Parametric and nonparametric data were compared by Student independent-samples t test and chi<sup>2</sup> test, respectively. Results Patients treated with HFJV under GA had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classifications (mean, 2.66 vs 2.23; P =.009) and smaller lung tumors (16.09 mm vs 27.38 mm; P =.001). The time duration (220.30 s vs 393.94 s; P =.008), number of CT fluoroscopic acquisitions (10.31 vs 19.13; P =.023), and radiation dose (60.22 mGy.cm vs 127.68 mGy.cm; P =.012) required for applicator placement were significantly lower in treatment sessions performed with HFJV under GA. There was no significant differences in anesthesiologist time (P =.20), rate of pneumothorax (P =.62), or number of pneumothoraces requiring active treatment (P =.19). Conclusions HFJV under GA appears to reduce technical difficulty of CT-guided percutaneous applicator placement for lung tumor thermal ablations, with similar complication rates compared with treatment sessions performed with NR under CS. The technique is safe and may facilitate treatment of technically challenging tumors. © 2014 SIR.",English,1

Materials and Methods: Whole-blood samples were collected from 36 patients at three time points: before ablation, after ablation (within 48 hours), and at follow-up (1-5 weeks after ablation). Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured using a multiplex immunoassay. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using cytokine level as the dependent variable and sample collection, time, age, sex, primary diagnosis, metastatic status, ablation site, and ablation type as the independent variables. Results: There was a significant increase in the plasma level of IL-6 after ablation compared with before ablation (9.6-fold+/-31-fold, P<.002). IL-10 also showed a significant increase after ablation (1.9-fold+/-2.8-fold, P<.02). Plasma levels of IL-1alpha, IL-2, and TNF-alpha were not significantly changed after ablation. Cryoablation resulted in the largest change in IL-6 level (>54-fold), whereas radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation showed 3.6-fold and 3.4-fold changes, respectively. Ablation of melanomas showed the largest change in IL-6 48 hours after ablation (92x), followed by ablation of kidney (26x), liver (8x), and lung (6x) cancers. Multivariate analysis revealed that ablation type (P<.0003) and primary diagnosis (P<.03) were independent predictors of changes to IL-6 after ablation. Age was the only independent predictor of IL-10 levels after ablation (P<.019). Conclusions: Image-guided thermal ablation of tumors increases plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-10, without increasing plasma levels of IL-1alpha, IL-2, or TNF-alpha. © 2013 SIR.",English,1

Fifteen to thirty percent of patients with a localized lung cancer are actually inoperable as they present with poor general condition, limited cardiopulmonary function, or a too high surgical risk. Therefore, minimally invasive treatments are needed and percutaneous ablation seems an attractive option. Thermal ablation can be performed by delivering heat (radiofrequency, microwave, laser) or cold (cryotherapy) through a needle inserted into the tumor under CT guidance. The ideal lesion is less than 2 or 3 cm in diameter. Success of percutaneous thermal ablation appears to be close to those of surgery for localized lung cancer. Nevertheless studies are still needed to definitely assess the role of ablation compared to other emerging techniques, as stereotactic radiotherapy as well as potential synergy with other treatments.",English,1

There is no large series assessing the effectiveness of local ablative therapies in the treatment of malignant or aggressive benign lesions in children. Objective: To review the existing evidence on the techniques and results of ablation for pediatric solid malignant or aggressive benign tumors. Materials and methods: We searched MEDLINE for papers published between 1995 and 2012 that reported outcomes of radiofrequency, microwave and cryoablation, interstitial laser therapy, irreversible electroporation and percutaneous ethanol injection for patients younger than 18 years old. Data collection included factors related to the patient, tumor biology, ablation technique and cancer-specific endpoints. Additional series of predominantly adults including data on patients younger than 18 years old were also identified. Results: We identified 28 patients treated by ablation in 29 regions: 5 patients undergoing ablation for liver lesions, 9 patients for lung metastases, 11 patients for bone and/or soft tissue and 4 patients for kidney or pancreas. The ablation was performed to treat primary tumors, local recurrences and metastases. The histology of the tumors was osteosarcoma in 6 patients, Wilms tumor in 3, rhabdomyosarcoma in 3, hepatoblastoma in 3, desmoid tumor in 3, adrenocortical carcinoma in 2 and a single case each of leiomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, paraganglioma, solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm, sacrococcygeal teratoma, hepatic adenoma, juxtaglomerular cell tumor and plantar fibromatosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients with inoperable stage I/II NSCLC tumors underwent thermal ablation and RT at our institution between 1998 and 2005. Thirty-seven radiofrequency (RF) ablation procedures and four microwave ablation procedures were performed. Ablations were followed by standard-fraction external-beam RT within 90 days (n = 27) or postprocedural brachytherapy (n = 14). Survival and local recurrence were the primary endpoints evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 19.5 months. The overall survival rates were 97.6% at 6 months, 86.8% at 1 year, 70.4% at 2 years, and 57.1% at 3 years. Patients with tumors smaller than 3 cm (n = 17) had an average survival time of 44.4 +/- 5.4 months (SE). Patients with tumors 3 cm or larger (n = 24) had an average survival time of 34.6 +/- 7.0 months (P = .08). Local recurrence occurred in 11.8% of tumors smaller than 3 cm after an average of 45.6 +/- 4.1 months and in 33.3% of the larger tumors after an average of 34.0 +/- 7.8 months (P = .03). Outcomes in the brachytherapy and RT groups did not differ significantly. Nine of 15 pneumothoraces required chest tube drainage (22.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Thermal ablation followed by RT for inoperable stage I/II NSCLC has a relatively low rate of complications that are easily managed.

Methods: From December 2002 to September 2003, 12 Chinese patients with 16 histologically proven lung malignant tumors (6 primary and 10 metastatic) were treated with US-guided PMA. All tumors were located at the peripheral portions of the lung where the tumors were in direct contact with visceral pleura and visualized on US. A total of 21 insertions with 25 applications was administered to the 16 tumors. There was no radiation or chemotherapy combined with PMA. Results: Based on the follow-up period of 6-40 months (average=20 months), seven patients survived without serious complications and five patients died from metastasis after PMA. The size of treated tumors was decreased in all cases (10 tumors with moderate to remarkable area reduction and 6 tumors with mild area reduction). Blood flow in the tumors became either invisible or diminished on color Doppler flow imaging, which showed 9 tumors with no enhancement and 7 tumors with partially decreased enhancement on contrast-enhanced computed tomography after PMA. All patients experienced improvement of clinical symptoms after PMA treatment. Conclusions: Ultrasonography-guided PMA, a mildly invasive procedure, is an effective, safe, and feasible method for treating peripheral lung tumors. Percutaneous microwave ablation provides an alternative therapy for patients with inoperable peripheral lung cancer as well as for patients who refuse radiation or chemotherapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

MWA is a novel method for treating inoperable tumors, ie, tumors that cannot be treated surgically. However, patients generally choose removal of the tumor by conventional techniques. A literature review of MWA for breast, liver, lung, and kidney tumors is reported here, with tabulation of our findings according to the type of technique used, with a detailed description of the time, type of microwave generator used, and number of patients treated with MWA. In some cases, the subjects were not human patients, but pig or bovine liver specimens. MWA is a technique that has proved to be promising and likely to be used increasingly in the ablation of cancerous tumors. However, MWA needs to be used more widely to establish itself as a common tool in the treatment of inoperable tumors.",eng,1

Purpose: To assess the feasibility of three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (3D CBCT) fusion imaging with ''virtual probe'' positioning, to predict ablation volume in lung tumors treated percutaneously. Material and Methods: Pre-procedural computed tomography contrast-enhanced scans (CECT) were merged with a CBCT volume obtained to plan the ablation. An offline tumor segmentation was performed to determine the number of antennae and their positioning within the tumor. The volume of ablation obtained, evaluated on CECT performed after 1 month, was compared with the pre-procedural predicted one. Feasibility was assessed on the basis of accuracy evaluation (visual evaluation [VE] and quantitative evaluation [QE]), technical success (TS), and technical effectiveness (TE). Results: Seven of the patients with lung tumor treated by percutaneous thermal ablation were selected and treated on the basis of the 3D CBCT fusion imaging. In all cases the volume of ablation predicted was in accordance with that obtained. The difference in volume between predicted ablation volumes and obtained ones on CECT at 1 month was 1.8 cm<sup>3</sup> (SD+/-2, min. 0.4, max. 0.9) for MW and 0.9 cm<sup>3</sup> (SD+/-1.1, min. 0.1, max. 0.7) for RF. Conclusion: Use of pre-procedural 3D CBCT fusion imaging could be useful to define expected ablation volumes. However, more patients are needed to ensure stronger evidence.",English,1

For patients with early stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer T1-2, N0) non-small-cell lung cancer, the current standard of care is lobectomy with systematic lymph node evaluation. Unfortunately, patients with lung cancer often have medical comorbities, which may preclude the option of surgical resection. In such cases, a number of minimally invasive to noninvasive treatment options have gained popularity in the treatment of these high-risk patients. These modalities provide significant advantages, including patient convenience, treatment in an outpatient setting, and acceptable toxicities, including reduced impact on lung function and a modest risk of postprocedure chest wall pain. We provide a comprehensive review of the literature, including reported outcomes, complications, and limitations of sublobar resection with or without intraoperative brachytherapy, radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, percutaneous cryoablation, photodynamic therapy, and stereotactic body radiotherapy.",English,1

Methods: Between July 2010 and September 2011, a total of 23 patients, 12 men, mean age 68 (range 30-87) years with 29 pulmonary malignancies of median diameter 19 (range 8-57) mm, underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided MWA with a 16G microwave needle antenna enabling power up to 180 W. Technical success was defined as needle placement in the intended lesion without death or serious injury. Adequacy of ablation was assessed at 24 h on contrast-enhanced CT. Circumferential solid or ground glass opacification >5 mm was used to define an ideal ablation. Local tumor recurrence was assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after ablation on contrast-enhanced CT. Results: MWA was technically successful in 93 % (n = 27). Mean ablation duration was 3.6 (range 1-9) min. Ten patients (43 %) developed a pneumothorax as a result of the MWA; only 3 (13 %) required placement of a chest drain. Thirty-day mortality rate was 0 %. The mean hospital stay was 1.5 (range 1-7) days. A total of 22 lesions (75 %) were surrounded by >5 mm ground glass or solid opacification after the procedure. At a median follow-up of 6 months, local recurrence was identified in 3 out of 26 lesions, giving a local control rate of 88 %.

Materials and Methods From November 2010 to June 2012, 15 patients underwent CT-guided MWA of 15 tumours in 16 sessions. One patient had a second ablation session for local tumour progression. Each tumour had a diameter of 40 mm or less (median 24 mm). Treatment outcome was evaluated using modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumours criteria based on follow-up contrast-enhanced CT studies and 18-F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans. Results Thirty-three ablation cycles of 15 tumours were performed in 16 sessions (2.1 per session), with a median duration of 2.5 min per ablation. Treatment was completed in all cases with no 30-day mortality. At a median follow-up period of 1 year, local progression was identified following 5/16 (31%) ablation sessions. Eleven out of 16 (69%) of MWAs had shown local treatment response, with 9/11 displaying complete response and 2/11 displaying partial response. Local progression on follow up was predominantly seen in pleural-based tumours that were greater than 30 mm in longest axial diameter (4/5 cases). The main adverse event was a pneumothorax, which occurred in 10/16 (63%) of procedures, but a chest tube was only required in 2/16 (13%) cases.

However, in the lung tissues treated with MWA recurrence of tumor may still occur and few data in large patient groups till now were reported about the safety or effectiveness of microwave ablation in treating primary lung cancer and metastatic pulmonary malignancies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical curative effect (local control, survival data) MWA and its safety as well.Methods: From 1 January 2005 to 1 January 2008, retrospective analyses, 69 patients underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous MWA of pulmonary malignancies. All patients were deemed medically inoperable. The correlation of tumor sizes and local progression after ablation was analyzed and the survival rates within 3 years post surgery were compared between non-small-cell lung cancer and pulmonary metastases groups also.Results: Pneumothorax was the most frequent complication and occurred in 24.64% patients after ablation. Neither needle track implantation was found nor did patient death occur in these patients within 30 days. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 66.7%, 44.9% and 24.6%, respectively. The overall survival rates for NSCLC patients in 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 75.0%, 54.2%, and 29.2%, respectively. The overall survival rates for pulmonary metastatic tumor patients in 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 47.6%, 23.8%, and 14.3%, respectively. The recurrence-free survival rates for NSCLC patients in 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 72.9%, 50.0%, and 27.1%, respectively. The mortality rates for pulmonary metastatic tumor patients in 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 47.6%, 19.0%, and 14.3%, respectively.Conclusions: Percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy was one safe and effective method and could be beneficial for the improvement of inoperable pulmonary malignancies treatment effect. © 2012 Lu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",English,1

Wei,2015,Percutaneous CT-guided microwave ablation as maintenance after first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC,http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S90528,"Background: Systemic therapy is recommended for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, conventional first-line treatment has generated a plateau in response rate of 25% to 35%. Few studies have shown patients benefit from microwave ablation (MWA) in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of percutaneous computed tomography-guided MWA as maintenance after first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC. Methods: Patients with histologically verified NSCLC stage IIIB or IV between January 2010 and March 2014 were involved. After completion of first-line treatment with partial response or stable disease, 35 patients with 39 tumors underwent 39 MWA procedures. Complications, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and correlated predictors were analyzed. Results: During a median follow-up of 17.7 months and 10.8 months after initial MWA, local efficacy was 87.2%, median MWA-related local control time was 10.6 months, and tumor size was the only predictor (P=0.002). Median MWA-related PFS, MWA-related OS, PFS, and OS were 5.4, 10.6, 11.8 and 17.7 months, respectively. Local efficacy was significantly cor- related with MWA-related PFS (P=0.003), MWA-related OS (P=0.000), and OS (P=0.001). There were no procedure-specific deaths. Total incidence of major complications was 12.8%, including pneumothorax resolved by closed pleural drainage and pneumonia controlled by antibiotics in a short time. Conclusion: This study concluded two points, including: 1) patients benefited from MWA as maintenance both in local control and survival; 2) as maintenance MWA was superior to conventional maintenance therapy with improved survival and well-tolerated complications. Therefore, MWA was a safe and effective maintenance after first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC.",English,1

Vogl,2011,Outcomes of an algorithmic approach to management of pneumothorax complicating thermal ablation of pulmonary neoplasms,10.1016/j.jvir.2011.05.014,"PURPOSE: To investigate the outcomes of an algorithm for treatment of pneumothorax in association with radiofrequency (RF) and microwave (MW) ablation of pulmonary neoplasms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included data from 248 ablation sessions for lung tumors in 164 patients (92 men; mean age, 59.7 y +/- 9.8): 200 RF ablations (80.6%) and 48 MW ablations (19.4%). Pneumothorax was classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Twelve patients developed mild pneumothorax and were observed for further complications, and 33 developed moderate or severe pneumothorax and were managed with percutaneous aspiration of the pneumothorax. The decision to abort or continue ablation was determined based on clinical response to percutaneous aspiration, clinical distress, and feasibility of applying the applicator within the lesion. RESULTS: Incidence of pneumothorax was 18.1% (45 of 248 sessions), with four (8.9%) occurrences during MW ablation and 41 (91.1%) during RF ablation. Pneumothoraces were mild in 12 sessions (26.7%), moderate in 27 (60%), and severe in six (13.3%). Complete evacuation of the pneumothorax was achieved in 25 of 33 sessions (75.8%). Intercostal tube drainage was indicated in eight sessions (24.2%), including six severe and two moderate pneumothoraces. Pneumothorax evolved immediately after thoracic puncture in 10 patients. Ablation therapy was aborted in two sessions in which severe pneumothorax occurred, and an intercostal chest tube was inserted. CONCLUSIONS: Mild pneumothorax can be managed by close observation without interruption of ablation therapy. Manual evacuation was an effective strategy for management of moderate pneumothorax and allowed for adequate positioning of the electrode, but did not suffice for severe and progressive pneumothorax, which required placement of an intercostal chest tube.",eng,1

Promising alternative treatments have been developed for high risk patients, who are (medically) inoperable due to bad general conditions. If lobe resection is not possible because of comorbidities or limited pulmonary function, we can offer less invasive surgical resection such as anatomic segmental resection or broad non-anatomic wedge resection. The results are similar to standard procedure, but the local recurrence rate is higher. Additional brachytherapy improves the outcome. Interventional radiological procedures are emerging as promising treatment options. First thermal methods such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA) and kryoablation are available. In addition selective chemoembolisation by a vascular catheter-guided access allows local chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods: Eighty-seven patients from two comprehensive cancer centers were included. Eighty-two patients were treated with RFA electrodes and five with microwave antenna. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated and predictive factors of local tumor progression, OS and DFS identified and compared by univariate and multivariate analyses Results: Median follow-up was 30.5 months (interquartile range 16.7-51) and tumor size was 21 mm (range 10-54 mm). Treatment was incomplete for 14 patients with a local tumor progression of 11.5, 18.3, and 21.1 % at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Two patients presented with neurological (grade III or IV) complications, and one died of respiratory and multivisceral failure as a result of the procedure at 29 days. In univariate analysis, increasing tumor size (P = 0.003) was the only predictive factor related to risk of local tumor progression. 5-year OS and DFS were 58.1 and 27.9 %, respectively. Sex (P = 0.044), pathology (P = 0.032), and tumor size >2 cm (P = 0.046) were prognostic factors for DFS. In multivariate analysis, pathology (P = 0.033) and tumor size >2 cm (P = 0.032) were independent prognostic factors for DFS. Conclusions: Oversized and overlapping ablation of N0 NSCLC was well tolerated, effective, with few local tumor progressions, even over long-term follow-up. Increasing tumor size was the main prognostic factor linked to OS, DFS, and local tumor progression.",English,1

Diagnostic studies that anticipate the changes in morphology are essential for earlier detection of residual viable tumor tissue or local recurrences to identify patients who will benefit from a new treatment. Our study has determined the diagnostic yield of PET/CT studies at baseline and follow-up and adequate time between them and the ablation intervention. Seven patients with single tumor lesion with a total of 8 ablations were included. CT and PET/CT studies were performed at baseline and follow-up after ablation. Average times between PET studies at baseline and follow-up and the ablative therapy were 1.8 and 3.4 months, respectively. Mean scores in metabolic activities of the PET at baseline and follow-up were 7.6 and 4.3g/ml of SUVmax, respectively. The Dual Time Point technique helped to identify viable tissue after ablation in 3 cases. Follow-up PET/CT studies have conditioned the various treatment strategies adopted by clinical oncologists. The high yield of the PET/CT study including the Dual Time Point technique may be considered as a study replacement of initial and follow-up Contrast-Enhanced CT before and after treatment with RFA and AMO, this achieving considerable reduction in the exposure to high radiation levels. We propose conducting the first PET/CT follow-up study at 3 months of the RFA and AMO.","eng

Patients and Methods: From December 2012 to November 2014, 17 patients (15 males, and two females, averaged 45.7 years old) with lung metastases from NPC accepted computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous MWA. The average number of lung metastases was 1.7 (range: 1-4), and the biggest tumor diameter was 4.2 cm (range: 0.8-4.2 cm). Nineteen nodules located in the right lung and 10 nodules located in the left lung. A total of 29 ablation sites were performed to 29 lung metastases in 22 MWA sessions. Postoperative assessments of complete tumor necrosis rate, safety, local tumor progression, and survival period were carried out. Results: Of the 29 lesions, complete response was achieved for 27 lesions; residual tumor was found in one lesion 3 months postoperatively; and another lesion was found enlarged 3-month postoperatively with obvious enhancement. Four patients had a small amount of postoperative parenchyma bleeding and two patients had a small amount of pneumothorax. Six months after MWA treatment, new metastatic lesions appeared in six patients, five patients had new metastatic lesions inside the lung, and the other patient had metastatic lesions in the thoracic vertebra. The time for the appearance of new pulmonary metastases for the five patients was 4-20 months, averaged 7.2 months. Conclusion: CT-guided MWA is a promising treatment alternative for local tumor control in selected patients with lung metastases from NPC.",English,1

Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approved the study with a waiver of consent. From July to December 2011, 23 patients (13 women, 10 men; mean age, 59 years; range, 35-87 years) with 29 FDG-Avid tumors (median size, 1.4 cm; range, 0.6-4.4 cm) were targeted for ablation. The location of the lesion was the liver (n = 23), lung (n = 4), adrenal gland (n = 1), and thigh (n = 1). Radiofrequency ablation was performed in 17 lesions; microwave ablation, in six; irreversible electroporation, in five; and cryoablation, in one. The pathologic condition of the tumor was metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma in 18 lesions, primary hepatocellular carcinoma in one lesion, and a variety of metastatic tumors in the remaining 10 lesions. A total of 4 mCi (148 MBq) of FDG was administered before the procedure for localization and imaging guidance. At completion of the ablation, an additional 8 mCi (296 MBq) of FDG was administered to assess ablation adequacy. Results of subsequent imaging follow-up were used to determine if postablation imaging after the second dose of FDG reliably helped predict complete tumor ablation. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results. Results: Twenty-eight of 29 (97%) ablated lesions showed no residual FDG activity after the second intraprocedural FDG dose. One patient with residual activity underwent immediate biopsy that revealed residual viable tumor and was immediately re-treated. Follow-up imaging at a median of 155 days (range, 92-257 days) after ablation showed local recurrences in two (7%) lesions that were originally negative at postablation PET. Conclusion: Split-dose FDG PET/CT may be a useful tool to provide both guidance and endpoint evaluation, allowing an opportunity for repeat intervention if necessary. Further work is necessary to validate these concepts. q RSNA, 2013.",English,1

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3698907/pdf/Dtsch_Arztebl_Int-110-0394.pdf","Background: About 50 000 new cases of non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung are diagnosed in Germany each year. More than 20% of the affected patients cannot be offered radical resection because of comorbidity alone. The lung is also the second most common site of distant metastases of extrathoracic tumors; it is the only site of such metastases in 20% of cases. In recent years, image-guided thermoablation has been used with increasing frequency in patients who are unable to undergo surgery for medical reasons. Methods: The PubMed database was selectively searched for publications on the indications, complications, and results of the thermoablative techniques currently in clinical use, with special attention to radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Results: There is only a small evidence base to date concerning the treatment of malignant lung tumors with thermoablation. Retrospective and prospective case series have been published, but no randomized controlled trials have yet been conducted. RFA, the most common technique, involves the image-guided percutaneous placement of one or more probes in the tumor, to which thermal energy is then applied. For peripherally located tumors that measure less than 3 cm in diameter, local control of tumor growth can be achieved in about 90% of cases. The long-term results that are now available from smaller series provisionally indicate 5-year survival rates of 20% to 61%. The most common complication is pneumothorax requiring drainage, which occurs in about 10% of cases. In the intermediate term, thermoablation does not cause any clinically relevant loss of pulmonary function. Conclusion: Image-guided thermoablation cannot now be considered an alternative to surgery for the treatment of malignant lung tumors with curative intent. It does, however, widen the spectrum of therapeutic options for patients who are medically unable to undergo a surgical procedure.","English, German",1

Dupuy,2011,Radiofrequency and microwave tumor ablation in patients with implanted cardiac devices: Is it safe?,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2010.04.004,"Purpose: To identify malfunction of implanted cardiac devices during or after thermal ablation of tumors in lung, kidney, liver or bone, using radiofrequency (RF) or microwave (MW) energy. Materials and methods: After providing written consent, 19 patients (15 men and 4 women; mean age 78 years) with pacemakers or pacemaker/defibrillators underwent 22 CT image-guided percutaneous RF or MW ablation of a variety of tumors. Before and after each procedure, cardiac devices were interrogated and reprogrammed by a trained cardiac electrophysiology fellow. Possible pacer malfunctions included abnormalities on electrocardiographic (EKG) monitoring and alterations in device settings. Our institutional review board approved this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study. Informed consent for participation in this retrospective study was deemed unnecessary by our review board. Results: During 20 of 22 sessions, no abnormalities were identified in continuous, EKG tracings or pacemaker functions. However, in two sessions significant changes, occurred in pacemaker parameters: inhibition of pacing during RF application in one, session and resetting of mode by RF energy in another session. These changes did not, result in hemodynamic instability of either patient. MW ablation was not associated with, any malfunction. In all 22 sessions, pacemakers were undamaged and successfully reset to original parameters. Conclusion: RF or MW ablation of tumors in liver, kidney, bone and lung can be performed safely in patients with permanent intra-cardiac devices, but careful planning between radiology and cardiology is essential to avoid adverse outcomes. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

These pneumothoraces were induced by the introduction of a needle with a spring-loaded, blunt-tipped obturator into the pleural space, followed by injection of room air. Pleural adhesions related to previous interventions may interfere with creation of a pneumothorax. Use of this technique could extend the utility of ablative therapies for lesions adjacent to the mediastinum and chest wall. © 2008 SIR.""",English,1

Methods From May 2010 to September 2014, 70 MWAs were performed on 51 patients. All major intra- and post-procedural complications (as defined by the classification proposed by the Society of Interventional Radiology) were retrospectively analysed. The results were correlated with a systematic review of the available literature on MWA in the lung. Results Major complications were encountered in 14 out of 70 ablations (20%). Twenty-one separate major complications were encountered (some ablations lead to more than one major complication). One death occurred within 30 days of ablation, though the relationship to the procedure remains uncertain. Other major complications included: nine pneumothoraces requiring drain insertion (12.9%), four cases of large effusion requiring drainage (5.7%), two cases of significant pulmonary haemorrhage altering clinical management (2.9%), two infections (2.9%), one case of mechanical failure (1.4%), one chest wall burn (1.4%) and one case of pleural seeding (1.4%). Major complications were much more likely to occur if the nodule was located within 7 mm from the pleura. Conclusion MWA of pulmonary tumours carries moderate risk; nevertheless, the usually manageable complications should not deter from undertaking a potentially curative therapy for poor surgical candidates.",English,1

Concentrations of serum VEGF in 20 healthy subjects were considered as controls. Changes of serum VEGF were detected by ELISA before and after MWA (1 and 7 days after treatment). Seven days after MWA, patients were divided into a combination chemotherapy group of 22 subjects and a MWA alone group of 18 subjects. Serum VEGF was measured 1 month after MWA and 4 cycles after chemotherapy (3 months) to evaluate term effects; and 1- and 2-year survival rates. Serum VEGF concentrations declined sharply 1 day after MWA, and were significantly different from the levels before treatment. Subsequently, VEGF rebounded 7 days after ablation, higher than that before treatment. At 1 and 3 months, serum VEGF levels in both treatment groups were remarkably lower than that before treatment; efficiency, or for the 1-year survival rate. However, the 2-year survival rates were significantly different between the two groups. We demonstrated that after MWA, the serum VEGF concentration undergoes a process of increasing, which might promote metastasis and recurrence of NSCLC. MWA combined with whole-body chemotherapy appears to be an effective method to increase the disease control rate, reduce the probability of metastasis and recurrence, and thus improve long-term survival.",English,1

A total of 39 lesions in 29 patients with peripheral lung cancer were treated by CT-guided PMAT under local anesthesia. The microwave energy was 50-70 W at a frequency of 2450 MHz. The treatment was performed by using 1 or 2 points of ablation emission according to the size and shape of the tumor. Operations were completed in 29 patients. The average operating time was 8 min (range: 5-12 min). After PMAT, lower density in the ablated area was observed by CT. Pre- and post-treatment CT values were 52.60 and 26.12 Hu, respectively. Eight, 14, 4, and 3 patients achieved complete remission, partial remission, stable status, and progression, respectively, for an effectiveness rate of 75.86%. Complications included 5, 2, and 15 cases of pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and fever, respectively. No needle track implantation was observed. Mean progression-free survival was 14.6 months.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients provided informed consent for this prospective institutional review board-approved study. Eighty patients (30 men, 50 women; mean age, 59.7 years +/- 6.4; range, 48-68 years) underwent computed tomography-guided percutaneous microwave ablation of pulmonary metastatic lesions in 130 sessions. The tumors represented metastases from colorectal carcinoma, breast carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and bronchogenic carcinoma; there was no evidence of extrapulmonary metastasis for any tumor. Logistic regression analysis was used for evaluation of the statistical significance of factors affecting the end result of microwave ablation therapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimation of survival rates. RESULTS: Complete, successful ablation was achieved in 95 (73.1%) of 130 lesions. Successful tumor ablation was significantly more frequent for lesions with a maximal axial diameter of 3 cm or smaller (90 of 110) than for lesions greater than 3 cm in maximal axial diameter (five of 20) (P < .0001) and for peripheral lesions (80 [80%] of 100) than for centrally located lesions (15 [50%] of 30) (P = .002). The histopathologic type of the metastasis did not significantly correlate with the ablation result (P > .3). The 12- and 24-month survival rates were 91.3% and 75%, respectively. There was no intraprocedural death, and the overall 60-day mortality rate after ablation was 0%. Higher survival rates were observed in patients with tumor-free states after successful ablation than in patients with failed ablation (P = .001). The incidence of pneumothorax was 8.5% (11 of 130). An intercostal chest tube was applied in one (0.8%) of the 11 sessions. Pulmonary hemorrhage developed in eight (6.2%) of 130 sessions. CONCLUSION: Microwave ablation therapy may be safely and effectively used as a therapeutic tool for treatment of pulmonary metastases. The efficacy of the treatment is primarily determined by preablation tumor size and location in relation to the hilum.",eng,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The single-antenna microwave ablation treatment of 91 index tumors in 57 patients was studied retrospectively. Time to local tumor progression was monitored on CT scans over the follow-up period. Estimation of overall time to local tumor progression was performed with the Cox regression model. Factors hypothesized to correlate with ablation response included tumor diameter, tumor shape (round or oval versus irregular), clear versus ill-defined tumor margin, adjacency to the pleura, adjacency to bronchi, presence of vessels at least 3 mm in diameter a maximum of 5 mm from the index tumor, energy applied to the index tumor, and the occurrence of cavernous formations after ablation. A logistic regression model was used to correlate the data. RESULTS: Thirty of 91 (33.0%) index tumors, found in 21 of 57 (36.8%) patients, underwent local progression. The mean time to local tumor progression was 8.3 +/- 5.5 months (range 2.1-25.2 months), and the estimated median time to local tumor progression was 22.6 +/- 12.4 months. The risk factors that correlated significantly with local tumor progression were a maximal diameter greater than 15.5 mm (p < 0.01), irregular shape of the index tumor (p < 0.01), pleural contact (p = 0.02), and less than 26.7 J/mm(3) applied to the index tumor (p < 0.001). After regression analysis, shape of the index tumor (p = 0.03) and energy deployed per unit volume of the index tumor (p = 0.001) were found to be independent risk factors. Conversely, tumor margin definition (p = 0.06) and proximity of cavernous formations (p = 0.19), juxtatumoral vessels (p = 0.08), and bronchi (p = 0.89) did not affect tumor progression after ablation. CONCLUSION: The independent predictive factors for local tumor progression in primary and secondary lung neoplasms up to 3 cm in diameter observed in this study were irregular shape of the index tumor and energy application of less than 26.7 J/mm(3) to the index tumor.",eng,1
Journal Article,E. J. Wasser; D. E. Dupuy,2008,Microwave ablation in the treatment of primary lung tumors,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2008-1081281,"Recent years have witnessed the refinement and significant growth of several new, minimally invasive approaches for the nonsurgical treatment of primary lung malignancies. For select patients, these technologies offer an attractive treatment option given their availability in the outpatient setting and low associated morbidity and mortality. Microwave ablation represents the most recent addition to the growing armamentarium of available ablative technologies. Administered in a manner similar to radiofrequency ablation, the lung tumor is localized under imaging guidance, and a microwave antenna is placed directly into the tumor bed. In contrast to existing thermoablative technologies, however, microwave treatment offers several key theoretical advantages. These include consistently higher intratumoral temperatures, larger ablation volumes, reduced treatment times, and improved convection profile. As a nascent technology, efficacy and outcomes data for microwave ablation of pulmonary malignancies remain relatively lacking compared with other thermoablative techniques; however, early trials have demonstrated promising results. It is hoped that further refinements in the clinical application of this technology will continue to improve the care of patients with lung cancer.

Patients with untreated, stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and at least one additional measurable site other than the ablative site were enrolled. They were divided into MWA/chemotherapy group and chemotherapy group. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included response, time to local progression (TTLP), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs). Forty-six and twenty-eight patients were enrolled in the MWA/chemotherapy group and chemotherapy group, respectively. Complete ablation was observed in 84.8 % patients in the MWA/chemotherapy group. Median TTLP was 27.0 months. Objective response rate and disease control rate in MWA/chemotherapy group were 21.7 and 76.1 %, and in the chemotherapy group were 32.1 % (p = 0.320) and 75.0 % (p = 0.916), respectively. MWA/chemotherapy combination prolonged PFS [MWA/chemotherapy group 10.9 (95 % CI 5.1-16.7) ms vs. chemotherapy group 4.8 (95 % CI 3.9-5.8) ms, p = 0.001] and tended to improve OS [MWA/chemotherapy group 23.9 (95 % CI 15.2-32.6) ms vs. chemotherapy group 17.3 (95 % CI 15.2-19.3) ms, p = 0.140]. Multivariate analyses showed that MWA was an independent prognostic factor of PFS and primary tumor size was an independent prognostic factor of OS. AEs of MWA were observed in 67.4 % patients.

METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with histologically verified advanced NSCLC and at least one measurable site other than the ablative sites were enrolled. Primary tumors underwent MWA followed by platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) and RECIST were used to evaluate therapeutic response. Complications were assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). RESULTS: MWA was administered to 39 tumors in 39 patients. The mean and median diameters of the primary tumor were 3.84 cm and 3.30 cm, respectively, with a range of 1.00-9.00 cm. Thirty-three (84.6 %) patients achieved a partial response. No correlation was found between MWA efficacy and clinicopathologic characteristics. For chemotherapy, 11 patients (28.2 %) achieved a partial response, 18 (46.2 %) showed stable disease, and 10 (25.6 %) had progressive disease. The overall objective response rate and disease control rate were 28.2 and 74.4 %, respectively. The median progression-free survival time was 8.7 months (95 % CI 5.5-11.9). The median overall survival time was 21.3 months (95 % CI 17.0-25.4). Complications were observed in 22 (56.4 %) patients, and grade 3 adverse events were observed in 3 (7.9 %) patients.

Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval and patient informed consent were obtained for this prospective HIPAA-complaint ablation and resection study. Between March 2009 and January 2010, 10 patients (four women, six men; mean age, 71 years; age range, 52-82 years) underwent intraoperative MWA of pulmonary malignancies. Power (10-32 W) and frequency (908-928 MHz) were continuously adjusted by the generator to maintain a temperature of 110degree-120degreeC at the 14-gauge antenna tip for one 10-minute application. After testing for an air leak, tumors were resected surgically. Gross inspection, slicing, and hematoxylin-eosin (10 specimens) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (six specimens) staining were performed. Results: Tumors included adenocarcinomas (n = 5), squamous cell carcinomas (n = 3), and metastases from endometrial (n = 1) and colorectal (n = 1) primary carcinomas. Mean maximum tumor diameter was 2.4 cm (range, 0.9-5.0 cm), and mean maximum volume was 8.6 cm 3 (range, 0.5-52.7 cm<sup>3</sup>). One air leak was detected. Five of 10 specimens were grossly measurable, revealing a mean maximum ablation zone diameter of 4.8 cm (range, 3.0-6.5 cm) and a mean maximum ablation zone volume of 15.1 cm 3 (range, 7.3-25.1 cm<sup>3</sup>). At hematoxylin-eosin staining, coagulation necrosis was observed in all ablation zones, extended into the normal lung in nine of 10 specimens, and up to blood vessel walls without evidence of vessel (> 4 mm) thrombosis. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide staining enabled confirmation of no viability within ablation zones extending into normal lung in five of six specimens. Conclusion: MWA with tumor permittivity feedback control results in cytotoxic intratumoral temperatures and extension of ablation zones into aerated peritumoral pulmonary parenchyma, possibly forming the equivalent of an oncologic resection margin. © RSNA, 2011.",English,1

Each tumor was ablated with computed tomographic (CT) guidance. Follow-up contrast material-enhanced CT and positron emission tomographic (PET) scans were reviewed. Mixed linear modeling and logistic regression were performed. Time-event data were analyzed (Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and log-rank statistic). All event times were the time to a patient's first event (alpha level = .05, all analyses). Results: At follow-up (mean, 10 months), 26% (13 of 50) of patients had residual disease at the ablation site, predicted by using index size of larger than 3 cm (P = .01). Another 22% (11 of 50) of patients had recurrent disease resulting in a 1-year local control rate of 67%, with mean time to first recurrence of 16.2 months. Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded an actuarial survival of 65% at 1 year, 55% at 2 years, and 45% at 3 years from ablation. Cancer-specific mortality yielded a 1-year survival of 83%, a 2-year survival of 73%, and a 3-year survival of 61%; these values were not significantly affected by index size of larger than 3 cm or 3 cm or smaller or presence of residual disease.

To study the pain relief effect of artificial pneumothorax in the treatment of subpleural lung tumors with MWA. Materials and Methods: From February 2012 to October 2014, 37 patients with 40 subpleural lung tumors underwent MWA, including 17 patients of 19 sessions given artificial pneumothorax prior to MWA (group-I), and 20 patients of 21 sessions without artificial pneumothorax (group-II). Patient's pain assessment scores (10-point visual analog scale [VAS]) at during-procedure, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the MWA procedure and mean 24 h morphine dose were compared between the two groups. Complications of the artificial pneumothorax were also summarized.

Methods From January 2011 to May 2013 in 184 consecutive patients (67 women and 117 men; mean age, 61.5 years; range, 19 to 85 years), 204 sessions of MWA were performed on 253 lung tumor lesions. Records were reviewed to evaluate prevalence of major complications and risk factors, which were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Major complications developed after 42 sessions (20.6%), including 32 cases (15.7%) of pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement which that were associated with emphysema (p = 0.001); 6 cases (2.9%) of pleural effusions requiring chest tube placement, which were associated with a distance of less than 1 cm from chest wall to target tumor (p = 0.014); 6 cases (2.9%) of pneumonia which that were associated with target tumor maximal diameter (p = 0.040); number of pleural punctures (p = 0.001) and ablation time (p = 0.006); and 1 case (0.5%) of pulmonary abscess. Two cases (1.0%) of the large pneumothorax occurred at the same time with extensive subcutaneous emphysema, including 1 case (0.5%) caused by bronchopleural fistula. Death related to the procedures occurred after 1 session (0.5%). Conclusions As a relatively practical and safe modality, lung tumor MWA can induce serious complications. Enough attention should be paid to patients with emphysema, subpleural, or large target tumor, but the indications for lung MWA need not be limited as most major complications were easily managed. © 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",English,1

Meng,2015,Bronchopleural fistula after lung ablation: Experience in two cases and literature review,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0019-509X.172512,"Background: Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) complicating lung tumor ablation is rare but severe. The purpose of this article was to study its characteristics and treatments. Materials and Methods: Two of 682 (0.3%) sessions of lung microwave ablation (MWA) were complicated with BPF and documented. Two electronic databases were searched for reported cases of BPF after lung tumor ablation. Case selection and data collection were done by 3 independent reviewers. Results: A 56-year-old man and a 61-year-old woman developed BPF after MWA and died. Thirteen cases (mean age 63.8, 61.5% male) of BPF with adequate information were identified from 8 articles. Of the 13 cases, 5 (38.5%) had pulmonary co-morbidity, 3 (23.1%) had a history of pulmonary surgery, 7 (53.8%) had a target tumor adjacent or abutting pulmonary pleura, and 6 (46.2%) developed severe infections. After chest tube placement, pleurodesis, endoscopic therapy, surgery, and other treatments, 12 were cured and 1 died of BPF and pneumonia. Conclusion: BPF is a rare but severe complication of lung ablation, and the management needs a multidisciplinary and individualized treatment strategy.",English,1
