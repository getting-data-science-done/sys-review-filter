In this study, we estimate the risks for developing a solid second cancer after radiotherapy of breast cancer using the concept of organ equivalent dose (OED). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computer-tomography scans of 10 representative breast cancer patients were selected for this study. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), tangential intensity modulated radiotherapy (t-IMRT), multibeam intensity modulated radiotherapy (m-IMRT), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) were planned to deliver a total dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Differential dose volume histograms (dDVHs) were created and the OEDs calculated. Second cancer risks of ipsilateral, contralateral lung and contralateral breast cancer were estimated using linear, linear-exponential and plateau models for second cancer risk. RESULTS: Compared to 3D-CRT, cumulative excess absolute risks (EAR) for t-IMRT, m-IMRT and VMAT were increased by 2 +/- 15%, 131 +/- 85%, 123 +/- 66% for the linear-exponential risk model, 9 +/- 22%, 82 +/- 96%, 71 +/- 82% for the linear and 3 +/- 14%, 123 +/- 78%, 113 +/- 61% for the plateau model, respectively. CONCLUSION: Second cancer risk after 3D-CRT or t-IMRT is lower than for m-IMRT or VMAT by about 34% for the linear model and 50% for the linear-exponential and plateau models, respectively."

New radiation modalities have been recently developed in early breast cancers, particularly accelerated partial breast irradiation. Three-dimensional conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation is the most commonly used modality of radiotherapy. Other techniques are currently being developed, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, arctherapy, and tomotherapy. The present article reviews the indications, treatment modalities and side effects of accelerated partial breast irradiation."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty women with breast cancer (stages 0-I) who underwent breast-conserving surgery were enrolled in a prospective registry evaluating APBI using a 0.35-T MR-IGRT system. Clinical target volume was defined as the surgical cavity plus a 1-cm margin (excluding chest wall, pectoral muscles, and 5 mm from skin). No additional margin was added for the planning target volume (PTV). A volumetric MR image was acquired before each fraction, and patients were set up to the surgical cavity as visualized on MR imaging. To determine the delivered dose for each fraction, the electron density map and contours from the computed tomography simulation were transferred to the pretreatment MR image via rigid registration. Intrafractional motion of the surgical cavity was determined by applying a tracking algorithm to the cavity contour as visualized on cine MR. RESULTS: Median PTV volume was reduced by 52% when using no PTV margin compared with a 1-cm PTV margin used conventionally. The mean (+/- standard deviation) difference between planned and delivered dose to the PTV (V95) was 0.6% +/- 0.1%. The mean cavity displacement in the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions was 0.6 +/- 0.4 mm and 0.6 +/- 0.3 mm, respectively. The mean margin required for at least 90% of the cavity to be contained by the margin for 90% of the time was 0.7 mm (5th-95th percentile: 0-2.7 mm). CONCLUSION: Minimal intrafractional motion was observed, and the mean difference between planned and delivered dose was less than 1%. Assessment of efficacy and cosmesis of this MR-guided APBI approach is under way."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: An imaging protocol was developed based on an existing breast MRI technique with the patient in the prone position on a dedicated coil. Pulse sequences were customized to exploit T1 and T2 contrast mechanisms characteristic of lumpectomy cavities. A three-dimensional image warping algorithm was included to correct for geometric distortions related to nonlinearity of spatially encoding gradients. Respiratory motion, image distortions, and susceptibility artifacts of 3.5-mm titanium surgical clips were examined. Magnetic resonance images of volunteers were acquired repeatedly to analyze residual setup deviations resulting from breast tissue deformation. RESULTS: The customized sequences generated high-resolution magnetic resonance images emphasizing lumpectomy cavity morphology. Respiratory motion was negligible with the subject in the prone position. The gradient-induced nonlinearity was reduced to less than 1 mm in a region 15 cm away from the isocenter of the magnet. Signal-void regions of surgical clips were 4 mm and 8 mm for spin echo and gradient echo images, respectively. Typical residual repositioning errors resulting from breast deformation were estimated to be 3 mm or less. CONCLUSIONS: MRI guidance for accelerated partial breast irradiation with the patient in the prone position with adequate contrast, spatial fidelity, and resolution is possible."

The aim of the study was to assess acute toxicity of this technique during breast cancer irradiation after conserving surgery or mastectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cutaneous toxicities, lung and oesophageal side effects, and breast lymphedema were retrospectively collected according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) in 292 patients treated for a breast cancer by tomotherapy between May 2010 and December 2014. After conservative surgery, the dose administered to breast volume and the tumour bed was respectively 52.2Gy and 63.8Gy in 29 fractions. After mastectomy, the dose was 50Gy in 25 fractions. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to highlight risk factors for dermatitis and breast oedema. RESULTS: The rate of dermatitis grade 2 and 3 were 22.9% and 1.7% respectively. In univariate analysis, factors associated with acute radiation dermatitis were breast volume (P=0.002), body mass index (BMI) (P<0.0001), the use of chest compression mask (net) (P=0.005) and the localization of the irradiation (P <0.0001). In multivariate analysis, BMI greater than 25kg/m(2) (odds ratio [OR]: 3.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.93-6.74], P<0.0001), the use of a chest mask (OR 2.01, 95% CI [1.06-3.79] P=0.0328) and irradiation after conservative treatment increase the risk of acute radiation dermatitis (mastectomy: OR 0.64, 95% CI [0.04-0.43]; mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with prosthesis: OR 0.13 95% CI [0.10-0.38] P=0.0003). The incidence of breast oedema grade 2 or above was 19.5%, in univariate analysis, there was a correlation with BMI (P=0.003) and smoking (P=0.009). In multivariate analysis, smoking and BMI greater than 25kg/m(2) increased the risk of breast oedema (OR 2.47, respectively [95% CI 1.22-5.01] P=0.012 and OR 2.37 [95% CI 1.22-4.59] P=0.01). The rate of radiation pneumonitis of grade 2 or above was 1.4%. Among the patients, 19.9% had esophagitis grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSION: The helical irradiation intensity modulation tomotherapy is a well-tolerated treatment for breast cancer that reduces the high radiation doses to organs at risk."
"K.E. Armoogum, S. Morgan, D.",2016,Modelling the radiobiological effect of intraoperative X-ray brachytherapy for breast cancer using an air-filled spherical applicator,X-ray brachytherapy breast cancer radiobiology,0,253,eng,"PURPOSE: We present a framework, in which we compare a conventional standard dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using electronic brachytherapy (eBT). We discuss how radiobiological modelling enables us to establish a framework, within which we can compare external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). This leads to a determination of the shell of isoeffect in breast tissue, at which very low kV eBT can be considered to be clinically equivalent to standard EBRT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To estimate relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values as a function of dose and irradiation time, we used a modified linear quadratic (LQ) approach, taking into account the ability of this new device, to deliver 20 Gy at the surface of a 40 mm diameter rigid, hollow spherical applicator in less than 2 minutes. In this study, we considered the radiobiological effectiveness of the Papillon + X-ray brachytherapy device operating at 30 kV, 0.3 mA producing dose rates in excess of 14 Gy/min. RESULTS: Calculated clinical RBEs ranged from 1.154 at the surface of a 40 mm diameter applicator to 1.100 at 35 mm from the applicator surface for the Papillon+ device. The absolute physical dose D (abs) 30 kV ranged from 20.00 Gy at the applicator surface to 1.20 at 35 mm distant. The product of the isoeffective single dose of (60)Co reference radiation - (RBE)(60)Co, and the RBE corrected standard 2 Gy equivalent dose fractions (EQD2) doses, EQD2(30 kV) * (RBE)(60)Co ranged from 98.62 Gy at the applicator surface to 1.13 at 35 mm. The 'shell of isoeffect', the value on the X-axis where the EQD2(30 kV) * (RBE)(60)Co line crosses the 50 Gy mark on the Y-axis, was found to be approximately 3.5 mm beyond the applicator surface. CONCLUSIONS: The 'shell of isoeffect' can serve as a useful metric with which to compare the radiobiological effectiveness of low kV eBT with various regimes of conventional EBRT."

Despite the advantages of accelerated treatment, maintaining an acceptable cosmetic outcome is important. In a cohort of patients who received low-dose-rate (LDR) or high-dose-rate (HDR) PBB after lumpectomy, the clinical characteristics and treatment parameters were analyzed to identify predictors for an unfavorable cosmetic outcome. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Early-stage breast cancer patients with clear resection margins and 0-3 positive lymph nodes were eligible for PBB. Uniform guidelines for target definition and brachytherapy catheter placement were applied. The HDR PBB dose was 34 Gy in 10 fractions within 5 days, and the LDR dose was 45 Gy given at a rate of 50 cGy/h. The end points included incidence of radiation recall reaction, telangiectasias, and cosmetic-altering fibrosis. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2000, 44 patients with early-stage breast cancer received PBB without adjuvant external beam radiotherapy after lumpectomy (31 HDR PBB, 13 LDR PBB). After a median follow-up of 42 months (range 18-86), all patients remained locally controlled. The overall rate of good/excellent cosmetic outcome was 79.6% overall and 90% with HDR PBB. Radiation recall reactions occurred in 43% of patients (6 of 14) who received adriamycin. LDR PBB and adriamycin were significant predictors for late unfavorable cosmetic changes in univariate analysis (p = 0.003 and p = 0.005, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although a high rate of local control and good/excellent cosmetic outcome is provided with HDR PBB, the risk of unfavorable cosmetic changes when treated with both LDR PBB and adriamycin is noteworthy. This suggests that HDR PBB is preferred in patients for whom adriamycin is indicated."

Addition of radiotherapy to surgery has significantly increased local control and survival rates of the disease. However, radiotherapy is also associated with side effects, such as tissue fibrosis or enhanced vascular morbidity. Modern radiotherapy strategies, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), can shorten the overall treatment time by integration of the additional tumor bed boost significantly. To what extent this might be possible without impairing treatment outcome and cosmetic results remains to be clarified. METHODS/DESIGN: The IMRT-MC2 study is a prospective, two armed, multicenter, randomized phase-III-trial comparing intensity modulated radiotherapy with integrated boost to conventional radiotherapy with consecutive boost in patients with breast cancer after breast conserving surgery. 502 patients will be recruited and randomized into two arms: patients in arm A will receive IMRT in 28 fractions delivering 50.4 Gy to the breast and 64.4 Gy to the tumor bed by integrated boost, while patients in arm B will receive conventional radiotherapy of the breast in 28 fractions to a dose of 50.4 Gy and consecutive boost in 8 fractions to a total dose of 66.4 Gy. DISCUSSION: Primary objectives of the study are the evaluation of the cosmetic results 6 weeks and 2 years post treatment and the 2- and 5-year local recurrence rates for the two different radiotherapy strategies. Secondary objectives are long term overall survival, disease free survival and quality of life. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol ID: NCT01322854."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An NTCP Lyman model with biologically effective uniform dose (BEUD) with and without a correction for the effect of incomplete repair was used. The time to occurrence of RIF was also taken into account. The radiobiological parameters were determined by fitting incidences of moderate/severe RIF in published randomized studies on RT of the breast. The NTCP model was used to calculate the risk of toxicity in 35 patients treated with intensity modulated, non-accelerated PBI and the result was compared with observed incidence of RIF. RESULTS: With alpha/beta fixed at 3Gy the parameters of the model without correction for incomplete repair extracted from fitting were: 50% complication probability biologically effective dose BEUD(50) = 107.2 Gy (95%CI = 95.9-118.6 Gy), volume parameter n = 0.06 (95%CI = 0-0.23), and slope of dose response m = 0.22, (95%CI = 0.20-0.23). After including the correction for incomplete repair with repair halftime for subcutaneous tissue of tau = 4.4 h we obtained BEUD(50) = 105.8 Gy (95%CI = 96.9-114.6Gy), n = 0.15 (95%CI = 0-0.33), m = 0.22 (95%CI = 0.20-0.23). Average NTCP predicted by these models, 4.3% and 2.0% respectively, offered a good agreement with RIF incidence in our patients, 5.7%, after an average follow-up of 12 months. CONCLUSION: The NTCP models of RIF, incorporating the effects of fractionation, volume effect, and latency of toxicity look promising to model PBI. Clinical validation from a prospective PBI treatment study is under development and will help test this preliminary result."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 68 patients (patient group A) were treated with 40 Gy in 10 fractions delivered by field-in-field, forward-planned IMRT. Isotoxic regimens with decreasing number of fractions were calculated using Biological Effective Dose (BED) to the breast. Risk for RIF in hypofractionated treatment was predicted by calculating NTCP from DVHs of group A rescaled to fractions and dose of novel regimens. Moderate/severe RIF was prospectively scored during follow-up. Various NTCP models, with and without incomplete repair correction, were assessed from difference to observed incidence of RIF. In order to verify the value for alpha/beta of 3 Gy assumed for breast, we fitted alpha/beta to observed incidences of moderate/severe RIF. RESULTS: Treatments with 35 Gy/7f and 28 Gy/4f were selected for the fraction reduction protocol. 75 patients (group B) were treated in 35 Gy/7f. Incidence of moderate/severe RIF was 5.9% in group A, 5.3% in group B. The NTCP model with correction for incomplete repair had lowest difference from observed RIF. The alpha/beta obtained from fitting was 2.8 (95%CIs 1.1-10.7) Gy. CONCLUSIONS: The hypofractionated regimen was well tolerated. The model for NTCP corrected for incomplete repair was the most accurate and an assumed alpha/beta value of 3 Gy is consistent with our patient data. The hypofractionation protocol is continuing with patients treated with 28 Gy/4f."

After mastectomy, radiotherapy of all node-positive patients seems to be applied whatever the positive node number. Modulation of RT technique uses the fraction dose, namely through accelerated hypofractionation regimen in a constant volume. A group of patient with a low risk of recurrence may benefit from this technique. In a smaller irradiated volume, accelerated hypofractionation still belongs to intensive clinical research evaluating intraoperative RT, brachytherapy, Mammosite, and external partial breast irradiation. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy decreases the risk of moist desquamation. The development of the gating offers greater protection of certain critical organs including lung, heart, and chest/ribs. Finally, predictive tests identifying patients at high risk of developing late effects led us to adapt RT technique to some of them and therefore increase long term therapeutic ratio."

The aim of this study was to elucidate the relative importance of such factors in the development of late toxicity after breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant breast radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient- and treatment-related factors were analysed in 1014 patients who had received adjuvant radiotherapy to the breast in the Cambridge Breast Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) Trial. Late toxicity data were collected using photographic and clinical assessments and patient-reported questionnaires at 2 years after radiotherapy. RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, a larger breast volume was statistically significantly associated with the development of breast shrinkage assessed by serial photographs (odds ratio per litre increase in breast volume = 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.41, 2.78; P < 0.0005), telangiectasia (odds ratio = 3.94, 95% confidence interval 2.49, 6.24; P < 0.0005), breast oedema (odds ratio = 3.65, 95% confidence interval 2.54, 5.24; P < 0.0005) and pigmentation (odds ratio = 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.21, 2.51; P = 0.003). Current smokers had an increased risk of developing pigmentation (odds ratio = 2.09, 95% confidence interval 1.23, 3.54; P = 0.006). Patients with a moderate or poor post-surgical cosmesis had a greatly increased risk of moderate or poor overall cosmesis (odds ratio = 38.19; 95% confidence interval 21.9, 66.7; P < 0.0005). Postoperative infection requiring antibiotics was associated with increased risk of telangiectasia (odds ratio = 3.39, 95% confidence interval 1.94, 5.91; P < 0.0005) and breast oversensitivity (odds ratio = 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.27, 2.49; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the greatest risk factors for the development of late toxicity 2 years after breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy were larger breast volume, baseline pre-radiotherapy surgical cosmesis, postoperative infection and possibly smoking. These factors seem to be more important than relatively small differences in dose inhomogeneity and the addition of boost radiotherapy at 2 years after the completion of radiotherapy. The modification of potentially preventable risk factors, such as postoperative infection and smoking, may limit the development of late toxicity after breast radiotherapy."

METHODS: Plans for 10 patients who met all dosimetry constraints on a prospective APBI protocol when using PBC calculations were recomputed with AAA and MC, keeping the monitor units and beam angles fixed. Similar calculations were performed for WBI plans on the same patients. Doses to target and normal tissue volumes were tested for significance using the paired Student's t-test. RESULTS: For WBI plans the average dose to target volumes when using PBC calculations was not significantly different than AAA calculations, the average PBC dose to the ipsilateral breast was 10.5% higher than the AAA calculations and the average MC dose to the ipsilateral breast was 11.8% lower than the PBC calculations. For ABPI plans there were no differences in dose to the planning target volume, ipsilateral breast, heart, ipsilateral lung, or contra-lateral lung. Although not significant, the maximum PBC dose to the contra-lateral breast was 1.9% higher than AAA and the PBC dose to the clinical target volume was 2.1% higher than AAA. When WBI technique is switched to APBI, there was significant reduction in dose to the ipsilateral breast when using PBC, a significant reduction in dose to the ipsilateral lung when using AAA, and a significant reduction in dose to the ipsilateral breast and lung and contra-lateral lung when using MC. CONCLUSIONS: There is very good agreement between PBC, AAA and MC for all target and most normal tissues when treating with APBI and WBI and most of the differences in doses to target and normal tissues are not clinically significant. However, a commonly used dosimetry constraint, as recommended by the ASTRO consensus document for APBI, that no point in the contra-lateral breast volume should receive >3% of the prescribed dose needs to be relaxed to >5%."

Computed tomography planning may increase tumour bed boost treatment accuracy. The aims of this investigation were (1) to compare the breast boost volume treated with clinical mark-up with the volume delineated with computed tomography planning and (2) to study tumour bed volume changes between the initial planning computed tomography scan and a second computed tomography scan at the time of breast boost mark-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women receiving adjuvant WBRT and an electron boost after breast-conserving surgery were eligible. As per standard practice, WBRT was computed tomography planned while the boost electron portal was clinically defined. Electron field borders were then traced with wire and a second computed tomography scan was carried out in the boost treatment position. Post-surgical radiological abnormalities were contoured to create a tumour bed clinical target volume (CTV) on both scans (CTV1 and CTV2). A 1cm margin to CTV2 defined the planning target volume (PTV). The proportions of the CTV2 and PTV receiving 90% (V90) and 80% (V80) of the dose were calculated. Changes in volume between CTV1 and CTV2 were analysed. RESULTS: Data from 47 eligible patients were analysed. The mean V90 for the PTV was 61%. Lower electron energy (P<0.001) and small field sizes (P=0.004) were associated with a low V90. The mean CTV decreased by 4.3 cm3 (P=0.014) and was smaller in those with a long surgery to computed tomography interval (P=0.008). On average, the 90% isodose covered 61 cm3 of normal tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional clinical breast boost planning is inaccurate. Electron boost computed tomography planning together with appropriate surgical clip placement and the use of mammograms and pathological information should provide optimal coverage of the tumour site. The boost could usually be planned from the initial computed tomography scan."

All cone beam CT scans were registered to the planning CT scan using 3 techniques: (1) rigid registration based on bony anatomy only, (2) rigid registration based on soft-tissue only, and (3) deformable image registration. For each patient, 4 dose distributions were calculated for APBI. The first dose distribution was the original plan. The other 3 were dose-of-the-day"" for each of the registration approaches. The effects of image registrations on estimating delivered dose to targets and OAR were determined. RESULTS: The average reductions in V95 (percentage of the PTV that received 95% of the prescribed dose) were 6%, 7%, and 5% for bone, soft-tissue, and deformable registrations, respectively. The average increase in mean dose to the heart were 9%, 9%, and 18% for bone, soft-tissue, and deformable registrations, respectively, whereas the average increase in maximum dose to the contralateral breast were 19%, 20%, and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study have shown that there are differences between the planned and estimated delivered dose for APBI because of day-to-day setup uncertainties that may need to be accounted for. Estimated dosimetric impact of setup variation and breast deformation assessed using deformable registration was greater for OARs and smaller for target volumes compared to rigid registration."""

OBJECTIVES: To examine the uptake and costs of hypofractionated WBI among commercially insured patients in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, observational cohort study, using administrative claims data from 14 commercial health care plans covering 7.4% of US adult women in 2013, we classified patients with incident early-stage breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and WBI from 2008 and 2013 into 2 cohorts: (1) the hypofractionation-endorsed cohort (n = 8924) included patients aged 50 years or older without prior chemotherapy or axillary lymph node involvement and (2) the hypofractionation-permitted cohort (n = 6719) included patients younger than 50 years or those with prior chemotherapy or axillary lymph node involvement. EXPOSURES: Hypofractionated WBI (3-5 weeks of treatment) vs conventional WBI (5-7 weeks of treatment). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Use of hypofractionated and conventional WBI, total and radiotherapy-related health care expenditures, and patient out-of-pocket expenses. Patient and clinical characteristics included year of treatment, age, comorbid disease, prior chemotherapy, axillary lymph node involvement, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, practice setting, and other contextual variables. RESULTS: Hypofractionated WBI increased from 10.6% (95% CI, 8.8%-12.5%) in 2008 to 34.5% (95% CI, 32.2%-36.8%) in 2013 in the hypofractionation-endorsed cohort and from 8.1% (95% CI, 6.0%-10.2%) in 2008 to 21.2% (95% CI, 18.9%-23.6%) in 2013 in the hypofractionation-permitted cohort. Adjusted mean total health care expenditures in the 1 year after diagnosis were $28,747 for hypofractionated and $31,641 for conventional WBI in the hypofractionation-endorsed cohort (difference, $2894; 95% CI, $1610-$4234; P < .001) and $64,273 for hypofractionated and $72,860 for conventional WBI in the hypofractionation-permitted cohort (difference, $8587; 95% CI, $5316-$12,017; P < .001). Adjusted mean total 1-year patient out-of-pocket expenses were not significantly different between hypofractionated vs conventional WBI in either cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Hypofractionated WBI after breast conserving surgery increased among women with early-stage breast cancer in 14 US commercial health care plans between 2008 and 2013. However, only 34.5% of patients with hypofractionation-endorsed and 21.2% with hypofractionation-permitted early-stage breast cancer received hypofractionated WBI in 2013."

Randomized trials demonstrated similar overall survival between mastectomy and breast-conservative surgery (BCS) followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). BCS plus adjuvant RT +/- systemic therapy has become the standard of care for women with early breast cancer. Advances in modern RT technology allowed significant increase in high precision of target definition. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and gating, under investigation in miscellaneous cancers, are also in development for breast-cancer patients. These techniques decrease radiation toxicities and could be useful in the setting of concurrent use of RT and new systemic therapies such as trastuzumab. Another advance in RT is the development of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) as a new concept in the adjuvant setting for early-stage breast cancer. Intraoperative RT (IORT), immediate postoperative RT (interstitial brachytherapy or Mammosite device implantation) and delayed postoperative RT (external beam of photons or protons with 3D conformation) are under investigation. In this review, the role of modern whole breast irradiation is discussed, the rational of partial breast irradiation is argued and the different techniques are detailed."

Based on the numerous studies which have reported that the local recurrences occurs within and surrounding the primary tumor site and in order to decrease the treatment duration and its morbidity, partial breast irradiation using several techniques has been developed. Partial irradiation may be considered as an alternative local adjuvant treatment for selected patients with favorable prognostic factors. Using external beam radiation therapy, the 3D-conformal technique is appropriate to deliver the whole dose to a limited volume. In UK, an intraoperative technique using a miniature beam of low energy of x-ray (50 Kv) has been developed (Targit). Milan's team have developed an intraoperative electrons beam radiotherapy using a dedicated linear accelerator in the operative room. In USA and Canada the MammoSite has been advised for clinical use in per-operative brachytherapy of the breast. These two last techniques are currently compared in phase III randomised studies to the standard whole breast irradiation followed by a tumour bed booster dose.

The device is placed inside the breast surgical cavity and inflated with a combination of saline and radiographic contrast to completely fill the cavity. The treatment schedule for the MammoSite monotherapy is 34 Gy delivered in 10 fractions at 1.0 cm from the balloon surface with a minimum of 6 hours between fractions on the same day. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review article presents the advantages, disadvantages, uncertainties and clinical outcomes associated with the MammoSite brachytherapy (MSB). RESULTS: Potential advantages of MSB are: high localised dose with rapid falloff for normal tissue sparing, minimum delay between surgery and RT, catheter moves with breast, improved local control, no exposure to staff, likely side-effects reduction and potential cost/time saving (e.g. for country patients). The optimal cosmetic results depend on the balloon-to-skin distance. Good-to-excellent cosmetic results are achieved for patients with balloon-skin spacing of > or =7 mm. There have been very few published data regarding the long term tumour control and cosmesis associated with the MSB. The available data on the local control achieved with the MSB were comparable with other accelerated partial breast irradiation techniques. The contrast medium inside the balloon causes dose reduction at the prescription point. Current brachytherapy treatment planning systems (BTPS) do not take into account the increased photon attenuation due to high Z of contrast. Some BTPS predicted up to 10% higher dose near the balloon surface compared with Monte Carlo calculations using various contrast concentrations (5-25%). CONCLUSION: Initial clinical results have shown that the MammoSite device could be used as a sole radiation treatment for selected patients with early stage breast cancer providing good local control, minimal complication rate and excellent cosmesis."

METHODS AND MATERIAL: A photogrammetry system was used in parallel to APBI setup by laser and portal imaging. Surface data were acquired after laser and port-film setup for 9 patients. Surfaces were analyzed in comparison to a reference surface from the first treatment session by use of rigid transformations. The surface model after laser setup was used in a simulated photogrammetry setup procedure. In addition, breathing data were acquired by surface acquisition at a frame rate of 7 Hz. RESULTS: Mean 3D displacement was 7.3 mm (SD, 4.4 mm) and 7.6 mm (SD, 4.2 mm) for laser and port film, respectively. Simulated setup with the photogrammetry system yielded mean displacement of 1 mm (SD, 1.2 mm). Distance analysis resulted in mean distances of 3.7 mm (SD, 4.9 mm), 4.3 mm (SD, 5.6 mm), and 1.6 mm (SD, 2.4 mm) for laser, port film, and photogrammetry, respectively. Breathing motion at isocenter was smaller than 3.7 mm, with a mean of 1.9 mm (SD, 1.1 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Surface imaging for PBI setup appears promising. Alignment of the 3D breast surface achieved by stereo-photogrammetry shows greater breast topology congruence than when patients are set up by laser or portal imaging. A correlation of breast surface and CTV must be quantitatively established."

The conventional method is whole breast irradiation. However, in selected patients partial breast irradiation can be performed, either with external beams or brachytherapy. In the current study three irradiation techniques are compared regarding dosimetric aspects. Treatment plans of thirty women treated with external beam conformal partial breast irradiation (CONF) were evaluated using dose-volume histograms. For the same patients whole breast irradiation plans (WBI) were made and compared with the CONF ones. Breast and lung of both sides, and heart at left sided lesions were contoured as organs at risk. After this, dose plans of another thirty patients treated with interstitial brachytherapy (IBT) were analyzed and compared with the CONF plans. According to our results the 90% isodose curve covered at least 97% of the target volume at all three techniques, and this value was 100% for CONF. The maximal dose within target volume was 106% in CONF and 115% in WBI plans. Volume of ipsilateral breast receiving the prescribed dose was 66%, 15% and 13% in the WBI, CONF and IBT plans, respectively. The dose to the contralateral breast was less for CONF compared to WBI. Volume of the ipsilateral lung receiving 30% of the prescribed dose was 15%, 8% and 1%, the maximal dose was 105%, 94% and 47% in the WBI, CONF and IBT plans, respectively. In the same order the maximal dose to the heart was 82%, 49% and 25%, while the dose irradiated to 5% of the heart volume was 27%, 19% and 14% at left sided lesions. Regarding target coverage, the conformal technique was the best, and the dose was more homogeneous than at WBI. With respect to dose to organs at risk the partial breast irradiation techniques were much more favorable than WBI, and the lowest doses occurred in the IBT treatment plans."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fibrosis was estimated by palpation in 404 patients by four physicians. The median follow-up (FUP) duration was 70 months (range 30-133 months). Original implant data were used for reconstruction and dose-volume calculations. The total dose of the external whole breast irradiation and iridium implants was expressed in Normalized Total Dose (NTD): the total dose given in fractions of 2 Gy, which is biologically equivalent to the actual dose given according to the linear-quadratic model, using an alpha/beta value of 2 Gy, and 1.5 h for the recovery half-life of sublethal damage repair. To identify predictors of fibrosis we used a proportional odds model in a polychotomous logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Seven independent factors were identified that were related to the severity of fibrosis: age, duration of FUP, clinical T-size, photon beam energy, NTD level, implant volume, and adjuvant chemotherapy. From the proportional odds model, a volume exponent could be estimated (0.16 +/- 0.04) that enabled us to determine dose-effect relations for different volumes. A 10-fold higher risk of fibrosis was seen when the total dose was above 79 Gy as compared with doses lower than 70 Gy. A fourfold increase in risk of fibrosis was seen for each 100 cm3 increase in irradiated boost volume. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy resulted in a twofold increase in the risk of fibrosis (dose modifying factor approximately 1.08). The application of Co-60 beams had a similar effect. The relative odds for the other factors were smaller (1.4 for each 10 years of older age, and 1.2 for clinical T-size over 20 mm). The FUP-period had a nonlinear effect: relative odds 2.2 at 6 years, 3.6 at 7-8 years, and 2.8 at 9-11 years. The dose rate (mean 0.57, range 0.26-0.89 Gy/h) had no influence on the development of fibrosis and there was no correlation between dose rate and irradiated volume. CONCLUSIONS: To optimize cosmetic results after BCT, both the total dose and the irradiated volume should be kept as low as possible. Minimum effective dose levels still have to be established. The boost volume can be minimized by more conformal brachytherapy techniques and optimal localization. It may be worthwhile to take adjuvant chemotherapy into account in decisions on boost dose levels."

Here, we report the original dosimetric results of this technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since October 2007, Institut Gustave-Roussy has initiated a phase II trial using 3D-conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation (40 Gy in 10 fractions BID in 1 week). Twenty-five patients with pT1N0 breast cancer were enrolled and were treated by two minitangent photons beams (6MV) and an en face"" electron beam (6-22 MeV). RESULTS: The mean clinical target volume and planning target volume were respectively 15.1cm(3) (range: 5.2-28.7 cm(3)) and 117 cm(3) (range: 52-185 cm(3)). The planning target volume coverage was adequate with at least a mean of 99% of the volume encompassed by the isodose 40 Gy. The mean dose to the planning target volume was 41.8 Gy (range: 41-42.4 Gy). Dose inhomogeneity did not exceed 5%. Mean doses to the ipsilateral lung and heart were 1.6 Gy (range: 1.0-2.3 Gy) and 1.2 Gy (range: 1.0-1.6 Gy), respectively. CONCLUSION: The 3D conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation using two minitangent and ""en face"" electron beams using a total dose of 40 Gy in 10 fractions BID over 5 days achieves appropriate planning target volume coverage and offers significant normal-tissue sparing (heart, lung). Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate the tissue tolerance to this radiation dose."""

METHODS: Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate dose distributions generated by a novel low-energy kilovoltage x-ray system to a variety of clinically relevant lesion sizes and depths in phantoms and for hypothetical partial breast irradiations of patients in supine and prone positions. The treatments by 200 kV KVAT system were modeled for four sizes of tumor (1-4 cm diameter) at three depths (superficial, middle, and deep) in two sizes of cylindrical water phantoms (16.2-cm and 32.2-cm diameter). In addition, treatments of 3-cm and 4-cm diameter lesions were modeled for two breast patients in prone and supine positions. Dose distributions were calculated using the EGSnrc/DOSXYZnrc code package. Phantom study metrics included lesion-to-skin ratio, dose delivered to isocenter (cGy/min), dose homogeneity, dose profiles, and cumulative dose volume histograms. Lesion-to-skin ratio, lesion-to-rib ratio, dose profiles, and cumulative dose volume histograms were used to evaluate simulated breast patient treatments. Supine breast irradiations were compared to 6-MV VMAT plans. The criterion applied to evaluate the dose distributions was derived from NSABP-B39/RTOG 0413 for accelerated partial breast irradiation. Skin dose was limited to a maximum of 250 cGy for a prescribed lesion dose of 385 cGy per fraction (with the whole treatment being delivered in 10 fractions). This produced the minimum lesion-to-skin dose ratio of 1.5 that served as the main guideline, along with other metrics, for evaluation of future clinical viability of treatments. RESULTS: Phantom dose distributions in the centrally located lesions treated with 360-degree KVAT were found to be superior to dose distributions in off-center lesions with the exception of isocenter dose, which was highest for lesions located closer to the phantom surface. Dose metrics were more favorable for smaller lesions, suggesting that KVAT might be most suitable for treatment of lesions of 1-2 cm in diameter down to depths of 8.1 cm along with 3 cm lesions at depths from 3 cm to 8.1 cm. In addition, treatments of 4-cm lesions were found to be acceptable down to the depths of 4.1 cm (in the 16.2-cm phantom) and 8.1 cm (in the 32.2-cm phantom). At depths from 8.1-cm to 16.1-cm, treatments of 1-cm to 4-cm lesions are possible at the cost of decreased dose rate. KVAT breast treatments in the supine patient position demonstrated that increasing the arc angle and decreasing lesion size improved lesion-to-skin ratio and lesion-to-rib ratio. Supine breast data indicate that 3-cm lesions are treatable at a minimum depth of 3 cm. The 6-MV VMAT plan resulted in lower doses to the ipsilateral lung and the body, but a higher heart dose compared to the KVAT plans. Dose distributions for the prone breast phantoms were superior to the supine cases due to the increased treatment angle of 360-degrees. CONCLUSIONS: Although nonoptimized KVAT dose distributions presented here were of inferior quality to VMAT plans, this work has demonstrated the feasibility of delivering low-energy kilovoltage x-rays to lesions up to 4 cm in diameter to depths of 8.1 cm while sparing surrounding tissue."

METHODS: Monte Carlo (MC) calculated, inversely optimized KVAT plans of spherical, idealized breast, lung, and prostate lesions were calculated using the EGSnrc/BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc MC codes. The dose delivered with the KVAT system, which generates 200-225 kV photon beamlets, was calculated and inversely optimized using an optimization framework developed at McGill University. KVAT dose distributions were compared with inversely optimized and MC generated megavoltage (MV) volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans as a reference. Prescription doses delivered to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) were 38.5 (10 fractions), 60 (30 fractions) and 73.8 (41 fractions) Gy for the breast, lung and prostate patients, respectively. Dose distributions, dose volume histograms, and PTV homogeneity indices were used to evaluate KVAT and VMAT plans based on RTOG protocols. RESULTS: All organ-at-risk (OAR) doses were within prescribed dose limits for KVAT and VMAT plans. Generally, KVAT plans delivered higher doses to OARs. For example, due to the lower energy of KVAT, 50% of the rib volume received 12.9 Gy from KVAT while only receiving 2.5 Gy from VMAT. OAR doses were especially high for the KVAT prostate plan due to the presence of large volumes of bony anatomy, which illustrates a limitation of the KVAT system. The KVAT treatment times per fraction for the breast, lung and prostate patients were 2.8, 2.6 and 5.5 min, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The inversely optimized KVAT plans presented in this work have demonstrated the ability of our novel low-cost, kilovoltage x-ray therapy system to safely treat deep-seated spherical lesions in breast and lung patients while meeting RTOG dose constraints on OARs."

METHODS: A clinical technique to provide reproducible breast immobilization was developed. Breast immobilization begins by fitting each patient with a treatment brassiere. Patients are placed prone in a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride shell with the upper and lower body being supported and immobilized with Vac-Lok foam bead cushions. The upper chest and breast areas are immobilized with two-part expandable foam. After a treatment planning computed tomography scan, the lumpectomy cavity is outlined, and a clinical target volume is generated by adding 1cm in all dimensions. A three-dimensional treatment plan is developed with treatment typically given with 2 to 4 separate proton beams. The dose administered is 40 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE) delivered in 10 daily fractions of 4 CGE with multiple fields treated each day. Proton and conformal x-ray plans were compared using dose-volume histogram analysis to determine volumes of normal breast tissue and skin treated with each technique. RESULTS: An institutional review board-approved clinical trial was developed using this technique, and 20 patients have completed treatment. All subjects were able to undergo the immobilization procedure and daily treatments without significant discomfort, and no treatment interruptions were encountered. There was no evidence of respiratory motion identified on treatment planning CT images or on daily set-up radiographs. Acute toxicity has been limited to occasional radiation dermatitis (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 1-2). Proton plans were compared with 2 methods of photon partial breast irradiation, including reduced tangential fields and five-field conformal techniques. Ten treatment plans with dose-volume histogram analysis revealed that the use of proton beams provided a significant reduction in doses to the ipsilateral breast and skin while eliminating doses to the heart and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A simple immobilization procedure provides accurate and reproducible breast positioning while simultaneously eliminating respiratory motion. The procedure has been well tolerated by the first 20 patients. Protons can provide substantial normal tissue protection compared with the use of conformal x-rays when used for partial breast treatment. We plan to continue enrollment and analyze long-term toxicity, local control, and survival."

In these cases, the traditional approach has been a complex 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT) beam arrangement which can result in significant dose heterogeneity at the beam junctions. A Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) beam arrangement has previously been proposed for breast cases, where the chest wall/breast is treated with a limited angle (partial arc) tangential VMAT technique (Viren et al. [2015] Radiat Oncol. 10:79). In our study, this approach is extended to breast and chest wall cases with adjoining nodes by adding a separate conventional VMAT arc field specifically limited to the superior nodes. This VMAT method was implemented using a semiautomated approach on 27 patients, and the resultant plan compared to a monoisocentric 3DCRT plan. Plan statistics, Dose-Volume Histogram (DVH) analysis and Radiation Oncologist (RO) preference were assessed. When compared to the 3DCRT technique, the VMAT planning method was found to result in better target volume coverage, high doses to organs at risk (OAR) were reduced but greater OAR volumes received low doses. Having said that, the volume receiving low doses with this tangential VMAT technique was less than that of other VMAT planning methods described in the literature, and the integral dose was less than the 3DCRT method. The VMAT technique also resulted in more robust junction doses that the 3DCRT method. RO review found that the VMAT technique was preferred in 81% of cases. Specifically, the VMAT plans were preferred in all categories of patients except left chest wall cases where the intermammary nodes were also treated. The VMAT technique described here is a useful addition to the treatment options available for breast/chest wall and nodal patients."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 45 breast cancer patients treated between 02/2009 and 02/2011 by concurrent trastuzumab and radiotherapy were collected. Radiation was delivered to the conserved breast or chest wall with or without regional nodes. Dose prescription was 50Gy in 25 fractions over five weeks with a tumor bed boost of 10Gy in 5 fractions in breast conservation. Acute cardiotoxicity (grade>/=1) was defined using NCI-CTC v2.0. Doses to the heart and left ventricle were quantified. RESULTS: Median follow-up of left ventricular ejection fraction and clinical assessment from the completion of radiotherapy was 10 months (range: 3-27 months) and 25 months (range: 13-40 months), respectively. Ten (22.2%) and one (2.2%) of the 45 patients developed grade 1 and grade 2 cardiotoxicity, respectively. For 24 left-sided patients, the mean heart dose was significantly higher in those with cardiac events compared to those without (10.14 and 6.27Gy, respectively; P<0.05). A continuous increase of D17-D57 and V10-V15 of the heart and increase of D40-D80 and V5-V7 of the left ventricle were statistically significant in left-sided patients who developed cardiotoxicity compared with those who did not (P<0.05). No significant relationship of dosimetric parameters of cardiac structures and cardiac events was found in right-sided patients.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients were treated with tomotherapy between January 2009 and March 2010. Treatment planning objectives were to cover at least 95% of the planning target volume with the 95% isodose; to have a minimum dose of 90% and a maximum dose of 105%. All treatments included daily CT/megavoltage image guidance. Acute toxicity was recorded weekly. RESULTS: Six patients were treated because constraints were not accomplished for heart, lung or contralateral breast in a previous three-dimensional conformal plan; two for preexisting cardiac or pulmonary disease, and two more for bilateral breast irradiation. Treatment volumes included the whole breast in the majority of patients, as well as the supraclavicular and the internal mammary chain nodes when indicated. Most patients were older than 50 years, and had an early breast cancer, with positive oestrogen receptors, negative HER2 expression and a poorly differentiated, infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The majority of patients had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy associated to breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant hormonotherapy. Median homogeneity index was 1.09; median coverage index was 0.81. Median V20Gy and V10Gy for ipsilateral lung was 20% and 37.1% respectively. Median V25 and V35 for heart was 15% and 4% respectively. Median dose for contralateral breast was 7 Gy. Skin acute toxicity was grade 1 in 41.7% and grade 2 in 58.3%. CONCLUSION: Tomotherapy is a technique capable of delivering a well tolerated treatment with high homogeneity and coverage indexes and high capabilities for sparing the organs at risk in patients with anatomically complex breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer, indication for internal mammary chain node irradiation, cardiac toxicity derived from chemotherapy, or preexisting cardiac or pulmonary disease. Further studies are required to evaluate local control and late toxicity."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Planning CT data sets of 15 patients with left breast cancer receiving multicatheter brachytherapy post breast conserving surgery were used to create two independent treatment plans - WBEBRT prescribed to 50 Gy/25 fractions and MCABPI prescribed to 34 Gy/10 fractions. Dose parameters for (i) LAD artery, (ii) heart, and (iii) ipsilateral lung were calculated and compared between the two treatment modalities. RESULTS: After adjusting for Equivalent Dose in 2 Gy fractions(EQD2), and comparing MCAPBI with WBEBRT, the largest dose reduction was for the LAD artery whose mean dose differed by a factor of 7.7, followed by the ipsilateral lung and heart with a factor of 4.6 and 2.6 respectively. Compared to WBEBRT, the mean MCAPBI LAD was significantly lower compared to WBEBRT (6.0 Gy vs 45.9 Gy; p<0.01). Mean MCAPBI heart D(0.1cc) (representing the dose received by the most highly exposed 0.1 cc of the risk organ, i.e. the dose peak) was significantly lower (16.3 Gy vs 50.6 Gy; p<0.01). Likewise, the mean heart dose (MHD) was significantly lower (2.3 Gy vs 6.0 Gy; p<0.01).

CONCLUSION: Compared to WBEBRT, MCAPBI showed a significant reduction in radiation dose for the LAD, heart and lung.

This study aims to test treatment planning on this modality and evaluate its performance by comparing to conventional LINAC-based 3DCRT planning. METHODS: Four clinical cases (whole brain, extremity, lung, and partial breast irradiation) were retrospectively selected from a Pinnacle planning system (Philips Medical System, Fitchburg, WI) and planned on Tomotherapy (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Computed tomography (CT) images together with contours of target and critical structures were exported from Pinnacle to the Tomotherapy planning station. The same prescription and fractionation scheme was adopted. The pitch factor for all clinical cases was set to 0.287. A 2.5 cm jaw was employed except in the lung case the field size was set to 1.0 cm for better dose conformity. The dose grid size was chosen to be half of that of the planning CT images. On Pinnacle 100% prescription dose was delivered to the treatment isocenter while onTomotherapy it was stipulated that at least 95% of the target volume received the prescribed dose. Comparison between two planning strategies was performed, in terms of dose volume histograms (DVH), dosimetric and radiobiological parameters, for plan quality assessment. RESULTS: Comparison of DVHs reveals that up to 25% healthy tissue sparing in volume can be accomplished with Tomotherapy 3DCRT while the same target coverage is ensured. Dosimetric and radiobiological indices between Tomotherapy and Pinnacle planning agree to within 3.0%. Additional beam modifiers and non-coplanar beams associated with LINAC-based 3DCRT are not needed on Tomotherapy, making it more favorable. CONCLUSIONS: Tomotherapy 3DCRT has similar dosimetric performance when compared to conventional LINAC-based 3DCRT while it is substantially easier to use."

In low-risk patients with early-stage disease, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an alternative for whole breast irradiation following breast-conserving surgery. MRI-guided single dose ablative APBI has the potential to offer a minimally burdening, non-invasive treatment that could replace current breast-conserving therapy. METHODS: The ABLATIVE study is a prospective, single arm, multicenter study evaluating preoperative, single dose, ablative radiation treatment in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Patients with core biopsy proven non-lobular invasive breast cancer, (estrogen receptor positive, Her2 negative, maximum tumor size 3.0 cm on diagnostic MRI) and a negative sentinel node biopsy are eligible. Radiotherapy (RT) planning will be performed using a contrast enhanced (CE) planning CT-scan, co-registered with a CE-MRI, both in supine RT position. A total of twenty-five consecutive patients will be treated with a single ablative RT dose of 20 Gy to the tumor and 15 Gy to the tumorbed. Follow-up MRIs are scheduled within 1 week, 2, 4 and 6 months after single-dose RT. Breast-conserving surgery is scheduled at six months following RT. Primary study endpoint is pathological complete response. Secondary study endpoints are the radiological response and toxicity. Furthermore, patients will fill out questionnaires on quality of life and functional status. Cosmetic outcome will be evaluated by the treating radiation oncologist, patient and 'Breast Cancer Conservation Treatment cosmetic results' software. Recurrence and survival rates will be assessed. The patients will be followed up to 10 years after diagnosis. If patients give additional informed consent, a biopsy and a part of the irradiated specimen will be stored at the local Biobank and used for future research on radiotherapy response associated genotyping. DISCUSSION: The ABLATIVE study evaluates MRI-guided single dose ablative RT in patients with early-stage breast cancer, aiming at a less burdening and non-invasive alternative for current breast-conserving treatment.

Preoperative radiation delivery to the intact tumor enables better target visualization and treatment volume reduction. Single dose preoperative APBI has the potential to improve toxicity profiles, reduce treatment burden and enable in vivo exploration of breast cancer radiogenomics. Purpose: Develop practical guidelines for single dose external beam preoperative APBI. Methods: Recommended dose constraints were derived from pooled dosimetry estimates from 2 clinical trials. In an American dose escalation trial, a uniform 15, 18 or 21 Gy dose has previously been evaluated for non-lobular cT1N0 or low/intermediate grade DCIS <2 cm in prone position (n = 32). In the Netherlands, the feasibility of ablative APBI (20 Gy to GTV, 15 Gy to CTV) to non-lobular cT1N0 in supine position, is currently being explored (n = 15). The dosimetric adherence to the developed constraints was evaluated in new APBI plans with a 21 Gy uniform dose but an extended CTV margin (n = 32). Results: Dosimetric data pooling enabled the development of practical guidelines for single dose preoperative APBI.

The adjuvant radiotherapy was 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the left breast alone. Four plans--conventional wedged tangents and forward intensity-modulated radiotherapy (fIMRT) in supine and prone positions--were generated. fIMRT generated better homogeneity in both positions. Prone position centralized the breast tissue by gravity and also shortened the breast width which led to better conformity in both planning techniques. Prone fIMRT significantly reduced doses to left lung, Level I and Level II axilla. The mean cardiac doses did not differ between positions. Among the four plans, prone fIMRT produced the best target dosimetry and normal organ sparing. In subgroup analysis, patients with absolute breast depth > 7 cm in the prone position or breast depth difference > 3 cm between positions had significant cardiac sparing with prone fIMRT. Sixteen patients with significant cardiac sparing in prone position were treated using prone fIMRT and the others using supine fIMRT. All patients received a supine electron tumor bed boost of 10 Gy in 5 fractions. No patients developed Grade 2 or worse acute or late toxicities. There was no difference in the number of segments or beams, monitor units, treatment time, or positioning reproducibility between prone and supine positions. At a median follow-up time of 26.8 months, no locoregional or distant recurrence or death was noted."

A total of nine patients with stage I, left-sided breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery were selected for this retrospective study. For each patient, a hybrid arc plan was generated and then compared with two hybrid intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans. All plans were optimized using the same objectives and dose constraints. The prescription dose was 50.4 Gy to the planning target volume with simultaneous boost to 60 Gy to the expanded gross target volume in 28 fractions. The differences among these hybrid plans were analyzed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The hybrid arc plans achieved the clinical requirements of target dose coverage and normal tissue (NT) dose constraints. It was found that the hybrid arc plans showed advantages in the conformity index of the expanded gross target volume, the V5 of the heart, the D2 of the left ventricle, and the D2 and V50.4 of NTs. The average beam-on time and monitor units of the hybrid arc plans were significantly lower (P < 0.001)."

A field-in-field-IMRT free-breathing plan and two field-in-field-IMRT moderate deep inspiration breath-holding plans were compared in the dosimetry to target volume coverage of the glandular breast tissue and organs at risks for each patient. RESULTS: The breath-holding time under moderate deep inspiration extended significantly after breathing training (P<0.05).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five consecutive patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) were treated by preoperative HT. All patients received up-front chemotherapy before HT. Irradiated volumes included breast and nodal areas (45-50 Gy) in 4 patients. One patient received a simultaneous integrated boost (55 Gy) to gross tumor volume (GTV) without lymph node irradiation. Acute toxicity was assessed with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v.4. Patients were evaluated for surgery at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Patients were staged IIB to IIIC (according to the AJCC staging system 2010). HT was associated in 4 patients with concomitant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and vinorelbine). Two patients were scored with grade 3 skin toxicity (had not completed HT) and one with grade 3 febrile neutropenia. One patient stopped HT with grade 2 skin toxicity. All patients were able to undergo mastectomy at a median interval of 43 days (31-52) from HT. Pathological partial response was seen in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: HT is feasible with acceptable toxicity profiles, potentially increased by chemotherapy. These preliminary results prompt us to consider a phase II study."

METHODS: This study was conducted using 15 patients with SBBC (5 with small breasts, 5 with large breasts, and 5 who underwent a left total mastectomy). The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as the volume enveloping the bilateral whole breasts/chest wall and left regional LN area. We established the following plans: 1) volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT)-the only plan using two pairs of partial arcs for the whole target volume, 2) VMAT using one partial arc for the left CTV followed by a 3D tangential technique for the right breast (primary hybrid plan), and 3) VMAT for the left CTV followed by a tangential technique using an automatically calculated prescription dose for the right breast, considering the background dose from the left breast VMAT plan (modified hybrid plan). The Tukey test and one-way analysis of variance were used to compare the target coverage and doses to organs at risk (OARs) of the three techniques. RESULTS: For target coverage, the VMAT-only and modified hybrid plans showed comparable target coverage in terms of Dmean (50.33 Gy vs. 50.53 Gy, p = 0.106). The primary hybrid plan showed the largest distribution of the high-dose volume, with V105% of 25.69% and V110% of 6.37% for the planning target volume (PTV) (p < 0.001). For OARs including the lungs, heart, and left anterior descending artery, the percentages of volume at various doses (V5Gy, V10Gy, V20Gy, V30Gy) and Dmean were significantly lower in both the primary and modified hybrid plans compared to those of the VMAT-only plan. These results were consistent in subgroup analyses of breast size and morphological variation. CONCLUSIONS: The modified hybrid plan, using an automatically calculated prescription dose for the right breast and taking into consideration the background dose from the left breast VMAT plan, showed comparable target coverage to that of the VMAT-only plan, and was superior for saving OARs. However, considering that VMAT can be adjusted according to the physician's intention, further evaluation is needed for developing a better plan."

METHODS: TomoDirect and 3D-CRT planning were carried out for 26 patients with early breast cancer who had received breast-conserving surgery. A total of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions were prescribed to the planning target volume. The organs at risk (OAR) such as lung and heart were contoured. Planning target volume (PTV) dose coverage, radiation conformity index (RCI), radical dose homogeneity index (rDHI), and irradiation dose of organs at risk were compared between TomoDirect and 3D-CRT planning. RESULTS: The mean PTV dose (51.65+/-0.37 Gy) and V47.8 (100%) in TomoDirect were significantly higher than the mean PTV dose (50.88+/-0.65 Gy) and V47.8 (89.23%+/-0.06%) in 3D-CRT (all, p<0.001). The RCI value in TomoDirect was significantly better than that in 3D-CRT (1.00 vs. 1.13, p<0.001). However, the rDHI value in TomoDirect was not significantly better than that in 3D-CRT (0.72 vs. 0.67, p=0.056). The mean lung dose and V10, V20, V30, and V40 values of ipsilateral lung in TomoDirect were significantly lower than those in 3D-CRT (all, p<0.05). There is no significant difference in the V10, V20, V30, and V40 values of heart between TomoDirect and 3D-CRT. And the mean dose for heart in TomoDirect was marginally lower than that in 3D-CRT (1.05 Gy vs. 1.62 Gy, p=0.085). The mean dose for left anterior descending coronary artery in left breast cancer was significantly lower in TomoDirect than in 3D-CRT (7.2 Gy vs. 12.1 Gy, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared to 3D-CRT, TomoDirect could result in favorable target coverage while reducing the irradiation dose of the ipsilateral lung for patients with early breast cancer."

All patients received weekly IGRT. The weekly setup errors from simulation to each treatment in reference to chest wall and surgical clips were measured. Random, systemic, and 3-dimensional setup errors were assessed. Extensive setup error was defined as 5 mm above the margin in any directions. RESULTS: All mean errors were within 3 mm of all directions. The mean angle of gantry shifts was 0.6 degrees . The mean value of absolute 3-dimensional setup error was 4.67 mm. In multivariate analysis, breast size (odds ratio, 2.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 7.90) was a significant factor for extensive error. The largest significant deviation of setup error was observed in the first week of radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and the deviations gradually decreased with time. The deviation of setup error was 5.68 mm in the first week and within 5 mm after the second week. CONCLUSION: In this study, there was a significant association between breast size and significant setup error in breast cancer patients who received TomoDirect. The largest deviation occurred in the first week of treatment. Therefore, patients with large breasts should be closely observed on every fraction and fastidious attention is required in the first fraction of IGRT."

We audited the value of titanium clips for TB localisation following breast conserving surgery (BCS) in breast radiotherapy (RT) planning. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At surgery, paired clips were positioned around the TB as follows: 1. Medial, lateral, superior and inferior: half-way between skin and fascia; 2. Posterior: at the pectoral fascia; 3. Anterior: close to the suture line. Thirty consecutive patients with clips inserted were audited at the time of RT planning. Audit standards were set as follows: (i) 5/6 pairs of clips identified on RT planning computed tomography (CT) scan - 100%; (ii) possible clip migration: <10%; (iii) TB localisation improved with clips: >50%. Inter- and intra-observer variability in clinician outlining of the TB was studied in a subset of 12 randomly selected patients to see if this impacted on positioning of radiotherapy field borders. RESULTS: Five or six pairs of clips were identified in all 30 cases. The TB could be successfully identified using CT seroma alone in only 8/30 (27%) patients. Clips were essential for the TB localisation of the other 22/30 (73%) patients. There was no evidence of clip migration. TB localisation led to modified RT field borders in 18/30 (60%) patients. Five of these patients had highly visible seromas, so the addition of clips modified field borders in 13/30 (43%) patients. Both inter- and intra-observer variability was reasonable and did not impact on positioning of radiotherapy field borders. CONCLUSION: Titanium clips provide an accurate and reliable method of TB localisation following BCS. We anticipate that the audit results will lead to clips being adopted as best practice by the Association of Breast Surgeons (ABS) at BASO (British Association of Surgical Oncology)."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients undergoing BCS for invasive cancer were recruited. Successful use was defined as all six seeds correctly positioned around the tumour bed during BCS, unique identification of all implanted seeds on CT planning scan and >/= 3 seeds uniquely identified at verification to give couch displacement co-ordinates in 10/15 fractions. Planning target volume (PTV) margin size for four correction strategies were calculated from these data. Variability in tumour bed contouring was investigated with five radiation oncologists outlining five CT datasets. RESULTS: Success in inserting gold seeds, identifying them at CT planning and using them for on-treatment verification was recorded in 45/51 (88%), 37/38 (97%) and 42/43 (98%) of patients, respectively. The clinicians unfamiliar with CT breast planning consistently contoured larger volumes than those already trained. Margin size ranged from 10.1 to 1.4mm depending on correction strategy. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to implant tumour bed gold seeds during BCS. Whilst taking longer to insert than surgical clips, they have the advantage of visibility for outlining and verification regardless of the ionising radiation beam quality. Appropriate correction strategies enable margins of the order of 5mm as required by the IMPORT trials however, tackling clinician variability in contouring is important."

In this study, dosimetric population-based respiratory margins and margin formulas for external beam partial breast irradiation are determined. METHODS: Volunteer respiratory data and anterior-posterior (AP) dose profiles from clinical treatment plans of 28 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) PBI patient plans were used to determine population-based respiratory margins. The peak-to-peak amplitudes (A) of realistic respiratory motion data from healthy volunteers were scaled from A = 1 to 10 mm to create respiratory motion probability density functions. Dose profiles were convolved with the respiratory probability density functions to produce blurred dose profiles accounting for respiratory motion. The required margins were found by measuring the distance between the simulated treatment and original dose profiles at the 95% isodose level. RESULTS: The symmetric dosimetric respiratory margins to cover 90%, 95%, and 100% of the simulated treatment population were 1.5, 2, and 4 mm, respectively. With patient set up at end exhale, the required margins were larger in the anterior direction than the posterior. For respiratory amplitudes less than 5 mm, the population-based margins can be expressed as a fraction of the extent of respiratory motion. The derived formulas in the anterior/posterior directions for 90%, 95%, and 100% simulated population coverage were 0.45A/0.25A, 0.50A/0.30A, and 0.70A/0.40A. The differences in formulas for different population coverage criteria demonstrate that respiratory trace shape and baseline drift characteristics affect individual respiratory margins even for the same average peak-to-peak amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: A methodology for determining population-based respiratory margins using real respiratory motion patterns and dose profiles in the AP direction was described. It was found that the currently used respiratory margin of 5 mm in partial breast irradiation may be overly conservative for many 3DCRT PBI patients. Amplitude alone was found to be insufficient to determine patient-specific margins: individual respiratory trace shape and baseline drift both contributed to the dosimetric target coverage. With respiratory coaching, individualized respiratory margins smaller than the full extent of motion could reduce planning target volumes while ensuring adequate coverage under respiratory motion."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Longitudinal cosmesis and QOL data were collected from a subset of TARGIT-A participants who received TARGIT-IORT as a separate procedure (postpathology). Patients completed a cosmetic assessment before radiation therapy and annually thereafter for at least 5 years. Patients also completed the combined European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire and Breast-Specific Module in addition to the Body Image after Breast Cancer Questionnaire at baseline and annually thereafter. The combined EORTC questionnaires were also collected 3, 6, and 9 months after wide local excision. RESULTS: An Excellent-Good cosmetic result was scored more often than a Fair-Poor result for both treatment groups across all time points. The TARGIT-IORT patients reported better breast-related QOL than EBRT patients. Statistically and clinically significant differences were seen at month 6 and year 1, with EBRT patients having moderately worse breast symptoms (a statistically significant difference of more than 10 in a 100-point scale) than TARGIT-IORT patients at these time points. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with TARGIT-IORT on the TARGIT-A trial have similar self-reported cosmetic outcome but better breast-related QOL outcomes than patients treated with EBRT. This important evidence can facilitate the treatment decision-making process for patients who have early breast cancer suitable for breast-conserving surgery and inform their clinicians."

Eight patients with Stage 0-I breast cancer underwent treatment planning for 3DCRT APBI. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as a 15-mm expansion around the cavity limited by the chest wall and skin. Three planning target volumes (PTV1, PTV2, PTV3) were generated for each patient using a 0, 5-, and 10-mm expansion around the CTV, for a total margin of 15, 20, and 25 mm. Three treatment plans were generated for every patient using the 3 PTVs, and dose-volume analysis was performed for each plan. For each 5-mm increase in margin, the mean PTV:total breast volume ratio increased 10% and the relative increase in the mean ipsilateral breast dose was 15%. The mean volume of ipsilateral breast tissue receiving 75%, 50%, and 25% of the prescribed dose increased 6% to 7% for every 5 mm increase in PTV margin. Compared to lesions located in the upper outer quadrant, plans for medially located tumors revealed higher mean ipsilateral breast doses and 20% to 22% more ipsilateral breast tissue encompassed by the 25% IDL. The use of 3DCRT for APBI delivers higher doses to normal breast tissue as the PTV increases around the lumpectomy cavity. Efforts should be made to minimize the overall PTV when this technique is used. Ongoing studies will be necessary to determine the clinical relevance of these findings."

Both clinical and treatment planning studies were investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Pubmed/MEDLINE search of the National Library of Medicine was performed to identify VMAT and breast related articles. After a first order rejection of the irrelevant findings, the remaining articles were grouped according to two main categories: clinical vs. planning studies and to some sub-categories (pointing to significant technical features). Main areas of application, dosimetric and clinical findings as well as areas of innovations were defined. RESULTS: A total of 131 articles were identified and of these, 67 passed a first order selection. Six studies reported clinical results while 61 treatment dealed with treatment planning investigations. Among the innovation lines, the use of high intensity photon beams (flattening filter free), altered fractionation schemes (simultaneous integrated boost, accelerated partial breast irradiation, single fraction), prone positioning and modification of standard VMAT (use of dynamic trajectories or hybrid VMAT methods) resulted among the main relevant fields of interest. Approximately 10% of the publications reported upon respiratory gating in conjunction with VMAT. CONCLUSIONS: The role of VMAT in the radiation treatment of breast cancer seems to be consolidated in the in-silico arena while still limited evidence and only one phase II trial appeared in literature from the clinical viewpoint. More clinical reports are needed to fully proove the expected dosimetric benefits demonstrated in the planning investigations."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 356 patients who had been treated with prone WBI using IMRT in our department between January 2004 and December 2006. Of these, 128 (36%) patients had received AWBI (representing 131 treated breasts), consisting of 16 daily fractions of 265 cGy to a total dose of 4,240 cGy followed by a conventionally fractionated boost. RESULTS: Patients who opted for AWBI were similar demographically to the patients undergoing conventional WBI. In the AWBI cohort, 83% of the patients had Stage T1 disease and 22% had nodal involvement (N1). The tumors were estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive and Her-2/Neu-amplified in 82%, 69%, and 11%, respectively. The median duration of AWBI plus a boost was 29 days, and no patient required a toxicity-related treatment break. No Grade 3 or greater acute toxicity developed. At a median follow-up of 18 months, one ipsilateral breast recurrence developed that was salvaged with mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. CONCLUSION: AWBI to the prone breast using simplified IMRT with a sequential boost offers women requiring breast-only adjuvant radiotherapy an abbreviated treatment with early tumor control and cosmesis comparable to that with standard fractionation."

METHODS: We performed a review of prospectively obtained data for patients with early-stage breast cancer with a pacemaker or AICD treated between April 2007 and July 2010. Patients were treated with either 3D conformal external beam irradiation (3D-CRT) or high-dose rate balloon brachytherapy (HDRBB) as performed in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Nowel Project (NSABP) B-39/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0413 protocol. Device interrogation was performed after the first and last radiation treatment, with comparative cardiac monitoring performed before and after the first three treatments. RESULTS: Eight patients were treated and have a mean follow-up of 6 months. Three patients received HDRBB delivering 34 Gy in 10 fractions. Mean planning target volume for evaluation (PTV_EVAL) coverage was 93.6%. The maximum radiation dose delivered to any device was 1.03 Gy, with a mean pacemaker distance to lumpectomy cavity (DLC) of 9.1 cm. Five patients received 3D-CRT consisting of 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions. The mean 90% PTV_EVAL coverage was 97.3%. Maximum dose delivered to any device was 1.68 Gy at a DLC of 9 cm. Local toxicity did not exceed grade 1, and no adverse device events were noted. CONCLUSIONS: APBI in patients with pacemakers or AICDs who desire breast preservation seems to be a technically safe and reasonable application of targeted radiation therapy."

This formalism allows a nonuniform dose distribution to be reduced to an equivalent uniform dose, while also accounting for fraction size. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five computed tomography scans were selected from a group of patients treated with multicatheter interstitial APBI. Dose matrices for the brachytherapy plans were computed and analyzed with in-house software. For each patient, the EUBED for the brachytherapy dose matrix was generated based on calculations performed at the voxel-level. These EUBED values were then used to calculate the biologically equivalent fraction size for 3D-CRT (eud). RESULTS: The mean equivalent fraction size (eudmean) and maximum equivalent fraction size (eudmax) were calculated for each patient using 100 different values of the alpha/beta ratio. The eudmean ranged from 3.67 to 3.69 Gy, while the eudmax ranged from 3.79 to 3.82 Gy. For all values of the alpha/beta ratio, the maximum fraction size calculated to deliver a biologically equivalent dose with 3D-CRT was 3.82 Gy, with an equivalent total prescription dose of 38.2 Gy. CONCLUSION: Utilizing a wide range of established radiobiological parameters, this study suggests that the maximum fraction size needed to deliver a biologically equivalent dose using 3D-CRT is 3.82 Gy, supporting the continued use of 3.85Gy BID in the current national cooperative trial."

After conserving surgery, it reduces local recurrence risks from 50 to 70%, both for ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive cancers. This was confirmed in several randomized trials and three meta-analyses. The boost increases local control in invasive cancers, but its role should be better defined in ductal carcinoma in situ. Among the latter, there is no clearly identified subgroup for which radiotherapy could be avoided. Local recurrence risk factors are now well-identified both for ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive cancers, with an inclusion, for the latter, of new molecular subgroups. After mastectomy, radiotherapy reduces local recurrence rates from 60 to 70%, especially among patients with axillary nodal involvement, with, in parallel, a 7 to 9% increased survival rate. In order to reduce the waiting list and to avoid under treatment, especially in the elderly, several hypofractionated radiotherapy schemes have been developed for several years. Three randomized trials confirmed similar results to classical radiotherapy. For ten years, several techniques of partial breast irradiation have been developed, with various doses and treated volumes. The optimal indications should be defined according to the new international guidelines."

This may impair patients' quality of life, cause pain and discomfort. In this study, we investigated treatment and patient-related factors, including genetic polymorphisms, that can modify the risk for severe radiation-induced skin toxicity in breast cancer patients. METHODS: We studied 377 patients treated at Ghent University Hospital and at ST.-Elisabeth Clinic and Maternity in Namur, with adjuvant intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) after breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer. Women were treated in a prone or supine position with normofractionated (25 x 2 Gy) or hypofractionated (15 x 2.67 Gy) IMRT alone or in combination with other adjuvant therapies. Patient- and treatment-related factors and genetic markers in regulatory regions of radioresponsive genes and in LIG3, MLH1 and XRCC3 genes were considered as variables. Acute dermatitis was scored using the CTCAEv3.0 scoring system. Desquamation was scored separately on a 3-point scale (0-none, 1-dry, 2-moist). RESULTS: Two-hundred and twenty patients (58%) developed G2+ dermatitis whereas moist desquamation occurred in 56 patients (15%). Normofractionation (both p < 0.001), high body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001), bra cup size >/= D (p = 0.001 and p = 0.043) and concurrent hormone therapy (p = 0.001 and p = 0.037) were significantly associated with occurrence of acute dermatitis and moist desquamation, respectively. Additional factors associated with an increased risk of acute dermatitis were the genetic variation in MLH1 rs1800734 (p=0.008), smoking during RT (p = 0.010) and supine IMRT (p = 0.004). Patients receiving trastuzumab showed decreased risk of acute dermatitis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The normofractionation schedule, supine IMRT, concomitant hormone treatment and patient related factors (high BMI, large breast, smoking during treatment and the genetic variation in MLH1 rs1800734) were associated with increased acute skin toxicity in patients receiving radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery. Trastuzumab seemed to be protective."

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: age > 18 years old, invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Stage I-II (T < 3 cm and N </= 3), breast-conserving surgery without oncoplastic reconstruction. Any systemic therapy was allowed in neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. All patients underwent VMAT-SIB technique to irradiate the whole breast and the tumor bed. Doses to whole breast and surgical bed were 40.5 Gy and 48 Gy, respectively, delivered in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Acute and late skin toxicities were recorded. Cosmetic outcome was assessed as excellent/good or fair/poor. RESULTS: The present study focused on results of a cohort of 144 patients with a minimum follow-up of 24 months (median 37, range 24-55 months). Median age was 62 years old (range 30-88). All patients had an invasive carcinoma (no patients with DCIS were present in this subset). At one year, the highest reported skin toxicity was G1, in 14 % of the patients; this data dropped to 4 % at the last follow-up, after more than 2 years. Breast pain was recorded in 21.6 % of the patients 6 months after treatment, while it was present in 3.5 % of the patients at the last follow-up, showing a significant improvement with time. Correlation between liponecrosis and boost target volume was found not significant. Breast pain was correlated with breast volume. No pulmonary or cardiological toxicities were recorded.

In this feasibility trial, we investigated the prone position for whole breast + lymph node irradiation (WB + LNI). METHODS: A new support device was developed for optimal target coverage, on which patients are positioned in a position resembling a phase from the crawl swimming technique (prone crawl position). Five left sided breast cancer patients were included and simulated in supine and prone position. For each patient, a treatment plan was made in prone and supine position for WB + LNI to the whole axilla and the unoperated part of the axilla. Patients served as their own controls for comparing dosimetry of target volumes and organs at risk (OAR) in prone versus in supine position. RESULTS: Target volume coverage differed only slightly between prone and supine position. Doses were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in prone position for ipsilateral lung (Dmean, D2, V5, V10, V20, V30), contralateral lung (Dmean, D2), contralateral breast (Dmean, D2 and for total axillary WB + LNI also V5), thyroid (Dmean, D2, V5, V10, V20, V30), oesophagus (Dmean and for partial axillary WB + LNI also D2 and V5), skin (D2 and for partial axillary WB + LNI V105 and V107). There were no significant differences for heart and humeral head doses. CONCLUSIONS: Prone crawl position in WB + LNI allows for good breast and nodal target coverage with better sparing of ipsilateral lung, thyroid, contralateral breast, contralateral lung and oesophagus when compared to supine position. There is no difference in heart and humeral head doses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: No trial registration was performed because there were no therapeutic interventions."

METHODS: Two megavolts flattening filter free x-rays were simulated using the Monte Carlo code MCNP (v4c). A convolution/superposition dose calculation program was tuned to match the Monte Carlo calculation. The modeled 2 MV x-rays and actual 6 MV flattened x-rays from existing Varian Linacs were used in integrated beam orientation and fluence optimization for a head and neck, a liver, a lung, and a partial breast treatment. A column generation algorithm was used for the intensity modulation and beam orientation optimization. Identical optimization parameters were applied in three different planning modes for each site: 2, 6 MV, and dual energy 2/6 MV. RESULTS: Excellent agreement was observed between the convolution/superposition and the Monte Carlo calculated percent depth dose profiles. For the patient plans, overall, the 2/6 MV x-ray plans had the best dosimetry followed by 2 MV only and 6 MV only plans. Between the two single energy plans, the PTV coverage was equivalent but 2 MV x-rays improved organs-at-risk sparing. For the head and neck case, the 2 MV plan reduced lips, mandible, tongue, oral cavity, brain, larynx, left and right parotid gland mean doses by 14%, 8%, 4%, 14%, 24%, 6%, 30% and 16%, respectively. For the liver case, the 2 MV plan reduced the liver and body mean doses by 17% and 18%, respectively. For the lung case, lung V 20, V 10, and V5 were reduced by 13%, 25%, and 30%, respectively. V 10 of heart with 2 MV plan was reduced by 59%. For the partial breast treatment, the 2 MV plan reduced the mean dose to the ipsilateral and contralateral lungs by 27% and 47%, respectively.

METHODS: Partial arc scan geometries were assessed on a treatment unit. Imaging dose measurements on an Elekta Synergy CBCT system were made in a CT dose phantom for scan parameters 100 kV, 25 mA and 40 ms with an S20 collimator. The protocol was used to verify the setup of a cohort of 38 patients, all of whom had surgical clips inserted in the tumour bed. Setup errors with and without an extended no action level (eNAL) protocol were calculated. RESULTS: Arcs from 260 degrees to 85 degrees (left breast) and 185 degrees to 15 degrees (right breast) were found sufficient to image fiducial markers and anatomy whilst accounting for the physical limits of the equipment. A single treatment and imaging isocentre was found by applying simple constraints: isocentre <8 cm from midline and isocentre-couch distance <30 cm. Contralateral breast doses were approximately 2 mGy per scan (right breast) and approximately 12 mGy (left breast). Both mean population systematic error and mean population random error were 3 mm prior to correction. The systematic error reduced to 1.5 mm using an eNAL correction protocol, implying that a 5-mm setup margin could be achieved. CONCLUSION: An image-guided verification protocol using CBCT for breast cancer boost plans was implemented successfully. Setup errors were reduced with an acceptable imaging dose to the contralateral breast."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography images from a cohort of 60 patients treated within the IMPORT HIGH trial (CRUK/06/003) were used to create sequential and concomitant boost treatment plans (30 cases each). Two treatment plans were created for each case using tumour bed planning target volume (PTV) margins of 5 mm (achieved with image-guided radiotherapy) and 8 mm (required for bony anatomy verification). Dose data were collected for breast, lung and heart; differences with margin size were tested for statistical significance. RESULTS: A median decrease of 29 cm(3) (range 11-193 cm(3)) of breast tissue receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was observed where image-guided radiotherapy margins were used. Decreases in doses to lungs, contralateral breast and heart were modest, but statistically significant (P < 0.01). Plan quality was compromised with the 8 mm PTV margin in one in eight sequential boost plans and one third of concomitant boost plans. Tumour bed PTV coverage was <95% (>91%) of the prescribed dose in 12 cases; in addition, the required partial breast median dose was exceeded in nine concomitant boost cases by 0.5-3.7 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: The use of image guidance and, hence, a reduced tumour bed PTV margin, in breast boost radiotherapy resulted in a modest reduction in radiation dose to breast, lung and heart tissues. Reduced margins enabled by image guidance were necessary to discriminate between dose levels to multiple PTVs in the concomitant breast boost plans investigated."

The incidence of radiation-induced fibroatrophy is around 10% at 5 years. A better knowledge of its pathophysiology has revealed the essential role of activated fibroblasts and reactive oxygen species, mediated by TGF beta 1, allowing the development of antioxidant in the management of the established radiation-induced fibroatrophy. Cosmetic sequelae are evaluated with standardized scales, such as the LENT-SOMA and must be monitored during at least 5 years. The main factors determining the occurrence of sequelae are a large breast volume, dose heterogeneity and the use of tumour bed boost after whole-breast radiation therapy. Intensity modulated radiotherapy and partial breast irradiation position themselves as a good alternatives to reduce the incidence of late skin side effects. The use of predictive tests of intrinsic radiosensitivity might fit into the therapeutic strategy."

Between August 2015 and September 2015, an e-mail/fax-based survey was sent to radiation oncology departments in Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking Switzerland. The questionnaire was divided into 3 chapters: a general chapter on the department, a chapter specific for heart-sparing techniques in patients with breast cancer, and a third chapter on personal beliefs on the topic of heart sparing in patients with breast cancer. A total of 82 radiation oncology departments answered the questionnaire: 16 university clinics and 66 other departments. In general, heart-sparing techniques are being offered by 90.2% of departments for radiation oncology in the German-speaking countries. However, in the clinical routine, 87.7% of institutions use heart-sparing techniques in less than 50% of patients with breast cancer. Heart-sparing techniques are especially provided for patients with left-sided breast cancer (80%), patients after mastectomy (52.5%), and when the mammaria interna lymph drainage vessels are irradiated (41.3%). In 46.3% of departments, there are written internal guidelines for heart sparing in patients with breast cancer. Breathing-adapted radiotherapy is used as the most frequent heart-sparing technique in 64.7% of the institutions, followed by intensity-modulated radiation therapy, which is most frequently used by 22.1%. The only significant difference between university hospitals and other departments was seen for the offering of partial breast irradiation. The most commonly used heart-sparing technique is breathing-adapted radiotherapy, but there is no coherent approach for heart sparing in patients with breast cancer in the German-speaking countries. Overall, all options for cardiac protection/cardiac avoidance have their advantages and disadvantages, with deep inspiration breath-hold radiotherapyhaving the most clear data, which should be the preferred choice when using heart-sparing techniques."

The cavities were determined and categorized by two radiation oncologists according to cavity visualization score criteria and the breast density score. The two physicians first attempted to delineate the lumpectomy cavity without clips and then with clips. RESULTS: In the case of high-density mammary tissue, the breast remodeling done during surgery does not enable the lumpectomy cavity to be sufficiently visualized. The use of surgical clips significantly improved the ability to visualize the lumpectomy cavity, with a 69% rate of concordance between physicians regardless of the breast tissue density. CONCLUSION: The placement of surgical clips at lumpectomy enables visualization of the lumpectomy cavity and allows upgrading of the cavity visualization score on CT scans obtained for accelerated partial-breast irradiation treatment planning."

METHODS: Forty CT-based 3D-APBI plans were retrieved on which a total of 4 radiation oncologists, two trainee and two experienced physicians, outlined the lumpectomy cavity. The inter-observer variability of LC contouring was assessed when the CTV was defined as the delineation that encompassed both surgical clips and remodelled breast tissue. RESULTS: The conformity index of tumour bed delineation was significantly improved by the placement of surgical clips within the LC (median at 0.65). Furthermore, a better conformity index of LC was observed according to the experience of the physicians (median CI = 0.55 for trainee physicians vs 0.65 for experienced physicians). CONCLUSIONS: The placement of surgical clips improved the accuracy of lumpectomy cavity delineation in 3D-APBI.

Indeed, some patients may have an unfavorable anatomy and/or inadequate dosimetric constraints could be fulfilled (complex cases""). In such cases, we wondered which treatment planning modality could be applied to achieve 3D-conformal APBI (2 mini-tangents and an ""en face"" electron field or non-coplanar photon multiple fields; or a mixed technique combining non-coplanar photon multiple fields with an ""en face"" electron beam). METHODS: From October 2007 to March 2010, 55 patients with pT1N0 breast cancer were enrolled in a phase II APBI trial. Among them, 7 patients were excluded as they were considered as ""complex cases"". A dosimetric comparison was performed according to the 3 APBI modalities mentioned above and assessed: planning treatment volume (PTV) coverage, PTV/whole breast ratio, lung and heart distance within irradiated field and exposure of organs at risk (OAR). RESULTS: Adequate PTV coverage was obtained with the 3 different treatment planning. Regarding OAR exposure, the ""mixed technique"" seemed to reduce the volume of non-target breast tissue in 4 cases compared to the other techniques (in only 1 case), with the mean V50% at 44.9% (range, 13.4 - 56.9%) for the mixed modality compared to 51.1% (range, 22.4 - 63.4%) and 51.8% (range, 23.1 - 59.5%) for the reference and non-coplanar techniques, respectively. The same trend was observed for heart exposure.

This report presents the use of serial computed tomography (CT) imaging, in addition to planar or ultrasound imaging, for the quality assurance of an APBI treatment using the elliptical MammoSite. METHODS AND MATERIALS: CT images of a patient implanted with a 4cmx6cm elliptical MammoSite balloon were acquired. A treatment plan using multiple, nonequally weighted dwells was generated and delivered on Day 1 of a 10-fraction, twice-daily treatment. Before morning treatments on Days 2-5, the patient was reimaged on CT. Treatment plans on repeat CTs were generated two ways: using the decay-corrected plan from Day 1 (unadapted) vs. modifying the plan to account for changes in implant geometry (adapted). Adapted and unadapted plans on repeat CTs were compared with one another, and to the Day 1 plan. RESULTS: The use of unadapted plans led to increased doses to normal tissues, particularly the skin. Adaptive planning on the repeat CTs was effective for maintaining acceptable dosimetry throughout treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Serial CT imaging was shown to provide a useful tool for the quality assurance of an elliptical balloon implant during the course of treatment. Serial CT imaging, as opposed to planar or ultrasound imaging, was necessary to evaluate skin dose and to facilitate adaptation of the treatment plan to satisfy limits for skin dose."

From January to December 2011, ten patients who underwent left breast-conserving surgery were enrolled in this study. CTA was performed in both the supine and prone positions during the simulation, and conventional scanning without CTA was performed at the same time. Image registration was performed for paired image series using a commercially available planning system. In a conventional image series, the clinical target volume (CTV) of the whole breast, planning target volume (PTV), bilateral lungs (L-Lung, R-Lung), spinal cord, contralateral breast (R-Breast), and heart were delineated. In the CTA image series, the left ventricular (LV) and left anterior descending coronary arteries (LAD) and the planning risk volume (LAD-PRV) of the LAD (LAD with a 1 cm margin) were outlined. For each patient, two separate IMRT plans were developed for the supine and prone positions. A total of 20 plans were generated. The following indicators were compared: Dmean and D95 for the PTV; Dmean, V5, and V20 for the left lung; Dmean, V10, V20, V25, V30, and V40 for the heart and its substructures (LAD-PRV, LV); Dmean and V5 for the right lung; and Dmax and Dmean for the right breast. Using CTA to delineate the substructures of the heart is simple and straightforward. Plans for both the prone and supine positions reached the prescribed dose for the PTV without significant differences. Dose distributions were acceptable for both the prone and supine positions. However, the LAD-PRV, LV, heart, and L-Lung received smaller doses in the prone position plans than in the supine position plans. The Dmean values reduced by 445.83 cGy (p = 0.043), 575.00 cGy (p = 0.003), 402.00 cGy (p = 0.039), and 553.33 cGy (p = 0.004) in the LAD-PRV, LV, heart, and L-Lung. In addition, the V25 lessened 12.54% (p = 0.042) and 8.70% (p = 0.019) in the LV and heart, while the V20 was decreased 8.57% (p = 0.042), 15.21% (p = 0.026), 12.59% (p = 0.011), and 10.62% (p = 0.006) in the LAD-PRV, LV, heart, and L-Lung, respectively. Similarly, the V10 and V30 were reduced by 28.31% (p = 0.029) and 5.54% (p = 0.034) in the heart, while the V5 was cut back 27.86% (p = 0.031) in the L-Lung. For most Asian women with average-sized breasts after breast conserving treatment (BCT), prone positioning during IMRT radiation will reduce the dose to the ipsilateral lung, heart, and substructures of the heart, which may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events after radiotherapy more than radiation therapy performed in a supine position. Using CTA to delineate the substructures of the heart is easy and intuitive. It is cost-effective and highly recommended for breast cancer IMRT. However, the dose-volume limits of the heart substructures remain to be determined."

A dose of 50Gy in 25 fractions was prescribed to the whole breast and an additional dose of radiation was prescribed on the tumour bed. A dose prescription of 60Gy in 25 fractions to the tumour bed was used in patients with negative margins after surgery, whereas if the margins were close (<1mm) or positive (without a new surgical resection) a dose of 64Gy was prescribed. All patients were followed with periodic clinical evaluation. Acute and late toxicity were scored using the EORTC/RTOG radiation morbidity score system. Both patient and physician recorded cosmetic outcome evaluation with a subjective judgment scale at the time of scheduled follow-up. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 28 months (range 24-40 months). The acute skin grade toxicity during the treatment was grade 0 in 8 patients (7%), grade 1 in 80 (72%), grade 2 in 24 cases (21%). No grade 3 or higher acute skin toxicity was observed. At 12 months, skin toxicity was grade 0 in 78 patients (70%), grade 1 in 34 patients (30%). No toxicity grade 2 or higher was registered. At 24 months, skin toxicity was grade 0 in 79 patients (71%), grade 1 in 33 patients (29%). No case of grade 2 toxicity or higher was registered. The pretreatment variables correlated with skin grade 2 acute toxicity were adjuvant chemotherapy (P=0.01) and breast volume >/=700cm(3) (P=0.001). Patients with an acute skin toxicity grade 2 had a higher probability to develop late skin toxicity (P<0.0001). In the 98% of cases, patients were judged to have a good or excellent cosmetic outcome. The 2-year-overall survival and 2-year-local control were 100%.

Given the conservative surgery and the nodal involvement after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, bilateral adjuvant RT to the breasts and regional nodes with doses of 50 Gy in 25 fractions and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) of 60 Gy to the surgical bed was proposed. Monoisocentric VMAT using 2 pairs of arcs was performed with adequate target dose coverage and low doses to the organs at risk. The results of this case were compared with those of previous studies in terms of RT technique and irradiated volumes.

As a trade-off, larger healthy tissue volumes would receive low dose levels, with the potential risk of increasing late toxicities and secondary cancer induction, although no clinical data are available today to confirm the risk level. The scope of this work is to explore the dosimetric trade-offs using two different VMAT plans. METHODS: Two planning strategies for dual-partial-arc VMAT, RA_avoid and RA_full, with and without avoidance sectors, were explored in a cohort of 20 patients, for whole left breast irradiation for 40.05 Gy to the mean target dose in 15 fractions. Common dose objectives included a stringent dose homogeneity, mean dose to the heart <5 Gy, ipsilateral lung (Ilung) <8 Gy, contralateral lung (Clung) <2 Gy and contralateral breast (Cbreast) <3 Gy. RESULTS: RA_full showed a better dose conformity, lower high-dose spillage in the healthy tissue and lower skin dose. RA_avoid presented a reduction of the mean doses for all critical structures: 51% to the heart, 12% to the Ilung, 81% to the Clung and 73% to the Cbreast. All differences were significant with p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The adaptation of VMAT options to planning objectives reduced significantly the healthy tissue dose levels at the price of some high-dose spillage. Evaluation of the trade-offs for application to the different critical structures should drive in improving the usage of the VMAT technique for breast cancer treatment. Advances in knowledge: Different planning strategies in the same VMAT technique could give significant variations in dose distributions.

This conventional approach can be improved by a field-in-field technique using the linac multi-leaf collimator (MLC). A simplified field-in-field technique that planners can easily achieve and which improves dose uniformity in the breast volume is presented here. Field junction problems are more easily solved by the use of a virtual simulation. A unique isocenter can be set at the junction between the supra-clavicular field and the breast tangential fields. However, careful quality assurance of the treatment planning system must be performed. Tomotherapy has promising clinical advantages: the ability of a tomographic image to correct for random set-up errors, a continuous cranio-caudal delivery which suppresses junction problems, the conformality of the dose distribution throughout the complex volumes formed by the lymph nodes and the breasts. Tomotherapy is a valuable recourse for complex irradiations like bilateral breast or mammary plus axillary irradiation while a field-in-field associated with a unique isocenter technique can be used for majority of the patients."

METHODS: A prospective cohort of 120 EBC patients underwent whole breast IMRT with TD between 2010 and 2012. Radiation was delivered to a conventionally fractionated whole breast total dose of 50 Gy with TD, followed by a sequential conventionally fractionated tumor bed boost dose of 10-16 Gy with helical tomotherapy (HT). Clinical endpoints include acute and late toxicity, cosmesis, quality of life and local control. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 24 months (range 12-36 months); maximum detected acute skin toxicity was G0 22 %; G1 63 %; G2 12 % and G3 3 %. Predictors of acute dermatitis were as follows: volume of the whole breast minus boost volume receiving 105, 110 and 115 % of prescription dose, whole breast and boost volume, breast thickness and soft tissue thickness. Late skin toxicity was mild with no >G2 events. Cosmesis was good/excellent in 91.7 % of patients and fair/poor in 8.3 %. Quality of life was preserved over time, but for fatigue, transiently increased. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant whole breast IMRT delivered sequentially with both TD and HT provides consistent clinical results. An observed unintended excessive dose outside the tumor bed might increase acute toxicity and eventually affect long-term clinical endpoints. The incorporation of the boost dose within the whole breast phase employing a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) approach might mitigate this issue."

This is an inconvenience to many women, and for some a barrier for breast conservation. We present the acute toxicity of a 4-week course of hypofractionated radiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 75 patients completed radiation on a Phase II trial approved by the hospital institutional review board. Eligibility criteria were broad to include any patient normally eligible for standard radiation: age >or=18 years, invasive or in situ cancer, American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage 0 to II, breast-conserving surgery, and any systemic therapy not given concurrently. The median age was 52 years (range, 31-81 years). Of the patients, 15% had ductal carcinoma in situ, 67% T1, and 19% T2; 71% were N0, 17% N1, and 12% NX. Chemotherapy was given before radiation in 44%. Using photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy and incorporated electron beam boost, the whole breast received 45 Gy and the lumpectomy bed 56 Gy in 20 treatments over 4 weeks. RESULTS: The maximum acute skin toxicity by the end of treatment was Grade 0 in 9 patients (12%), Grade 1 in 49 (65%) and Grade 2 in 17 (23%). There was no Grade 3 or higher skin toxicity. After radiation, all Grade 2 toxicity had resolved by 6 weeks. Hematologic toxicity was Grade 0 in most patients except for Grade 1 neutropenia in 2 patients, and Grade 1 anemia in 11 patients. There were no significant differences in baseline vs. 6-week posttreatment patient-reported or physician-reported cosmetic scores. CONCLUSIONS: This 4-week course of postoperative radiation using intensity-modulated radiation therapy is feasible and is associated with acceptable acute skin toxicity and quality of life. Long-term follow-up data are needed. This radiation schedule may represent an alternative both to longer 6-week to 7-week standard whole-breast radiation and more radically shortened 1-week, partial-breast treatment schedules."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study population consisted of 804 consecutive women with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation from 2001 to 2006. All patients were treated with whole-breast radiation followed by a boost to the tumor bed. Whole-breast radiation consisted of conventional wedged photon tangents (n = 405) earlier in the study period and mostly of photon IMRT (n = 399) in later years. All patients had acute dermatitis graded each week of treatment. RESULTS: The breakdown of the cases of maximum acute dermatitis by grade was as follows: 3%, Grade 0; 34%, Grade 1; 61%, Grade 2; and 2%, Grade 3. The breakdown of cases of maximum toxicity by technique was as follows: 48%, Grade 0/1, and 52%, Grade 2/3, for IMRT; and 25%, Grade 0/1, and 75%, Grade 2/3, for conventional radiation therapy (p < 0.0001). The IMRT patients spent 82% of weeks during treatment with Grade 0/1 dermatitis and 18% with Grade 2/3 dermatitis, compared with 29% and 71% of patients, respectively, treated with conventional radiation (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the time spent with Grade 2/3 toxicity was decreased in IMRT patients with small (p = 0.0015), medium (p < 0.0001), and large (p < 0.0001) breasts. CONCLUSIONS: Breast IMRT is associated with a significant decrease both in the time spent during treatment with Grade 2/3 dermatitis and in the maximum severity of dermatitis compared with that associated with conventional radiation, regardless of breast size."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study design was phase II with a planned accrual of 75 patients. Eligibility included patients aged>/=18 years, Tis-T2, stage 0-II, and breast conservation. Photon IMRT and an incorporated boost was used, and the whole breast received 2.25 Gy per fraction for a total of 45 Gy, and the tumor bed received 2.8 Gy per fraction for a total of 56 Gy in 20 treatments over 4 weeks.

The objective of this study was to compare the external surface contour (ext) model of the skin with our current volumetric model for skin for radiation treatment planning in accelerated partial breast irradiation brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A literature search was conducted to identify studies measuring breast epidermal thickness. Clinical plans were performed with a 2-mm contraction of the external surface contour. This 2-mm contraction of the external surface contour was used to approximate breast epidermis thickness. Then, the external surface contour was expanded 5mm outside the external contour of the patient for the second skin model. Maximum doses from the two models were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The average breast epidermal thickness from five studies was 1.68mm. Mean percent difference between skin and ext+5mm for balloon plans, strut plans, and all plans was 10.1%, 14.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. Differences in doses between the two skin models were statistically significant (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The volumetric skin model was validated because the average breast epidermal thickness was 1.68mm. The surface model for skin may underestimate the dose delivered to the epidermis by as much as 23.8%. The external surface contour method does not accurately represent the dermatologic skin thickness of the breast as the skin is modeled as a surface rather than a volume. These discrepancies may skew correlations of dose to skin and toxicity determinations."

We report the feasibility and dosimetric analysis of a simplified intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) technique, previously reported for women in the supine treatment position, to plan prone-position RT to the intact breast. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with clinical Stage TisN0-T1bN1 breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving therapy underwent whole breast RT using a prone position technique. The treatment plans were developed using both conventional tangents and a simplified intensity-modulated tangential beam technique based on optimization of the intensity distributions across the breast. The plans were compared with regard to the dose-volume parameters. RESULTS: Dose heterogeneity within the breast planning target volume was significantly greater for the conventional tangent plans. Of 20 patients, 16 (80%) received maximal doses of > or =110% using the conventional tangents vs. only 1 (5%) using the IMRT plan. The isodose level encompassing 5% of the planning target volume was reduced from an average of 110% with conventional tangents to 105% with IMRT. The maximal dose within the planning target volume was reduced from an average of 114% with conventional tangents to 107% with IMRT. The greatest improvement was seen in the patients with the most pendulous breasts. CONCLUSION: An IMRT planning approach is feasible for prone-position breast RT and improves dose homogeneity, particularly in women with larger, pendulous breasts. Additional follow-up is necessary to determine whether the improvements in dose homogeneity impact acute toxicity and cosmetic outcome in this cohort of women who have historically suffered from poor cosmesis after breast-conserving therapy."

The absolute size of this benefit varies according to the baseline risk of local recurrence. Age is the strongest predictor of benefit. Below the age of 40 years, the absolute benefit of a boost seems to be substantial, and there are no clearly identified groups unlikely to benefit. Above the age of 50 years, the benefit is small, and several additional risk factors for local failure would need to be present to merit boost treatment. These may include tumour size, high grade, high mitotic rate, lymphovascular invasion, extensive and high grade associated with intraduct carcinoma, receptor-positive tumours when avoidance of anti-oestrogen therapy is desired or receptor-negative tumours. Other independent reasonable indications for the use of a boost would be positive margins where further surgery is not indicated. If a boost is indicated, a variety of techniques may be used and toxicity and cosmetic results remain highly acceptable. Overall, there seems to be no substantial differences in boost technique results; however, interstitial techniques may have advantages for deeper targets compared with electrons. Irrespective of technique, accurate localisation will maximise the benefit of a boost. Surgical clips are strongly recommended to facilitate localisation."

Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 470 patients with early BC treated at our center from September 2009 to December 2012. 235 women were treated with breast-conserving surgery and immediate IORT-E (21 Gy/1 fraction) while 235 patients underwent wide excision followed by hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation. Radiotherapy modality was chosen according to an individualized decision based on tumor features, stage, technical feasibility, age, and acceptance to be enrolled in the IORT-E group. Results: After a median follow-up of 6 years, we observed 8 (3.4%) and 1 (0.42%) LR in the IORT-E and in the HYPOFX group (p = 0.02), respectively. The two groups differed in the prevalence of clinical characteristics (p < 0.05): age, tumor size, surgical margins, receptors, ki67, and histology. 4 and 1 woman in the IORT-E and HYPOFX group died of BC, respectively (p = 0.167). OS and DFS hazard ratio [HR] were 2.14 (95% IC, 1.10-4.15) and 2.09 (95% IC, 1.17-3.73), respectively. Conclusion: Our comparison showed that IORT-E and HYPOFX are two effective radiotherapy modalities after conservative surgery in early BC. However, at 6 years a significant higher rate of LR occurred in patients submitted to IORT-E with respect to HYPOFX. This finding may be correlated to some subsets of patients who, depending on the biological characteristics of the BC, may be less suitable to IORT-E."

METHODS: Patients with a seroma clarity score (SCS) 3 ~ 5 and >/=5 surgical clips in the lumpectomy cavity after breast-conserving surgery who were recruited for EB-PBI underwent 4DCT simulation. Based on the ten sets of 4DCT images acquired, the tumour bed formed using the clips, the seroma, and both the clips and seroma (defined as TBC, TBS and TBC+S, respectively) were delineated by five radiation oncologists using specific guidelines. The following parameters were calculated to analyse interobserver variability: volume of the tumour bed (TBC, TBS, TBC+S), coefficient of variation (COVC, COVS, COVC+S), and matching degree (MDC, MDS, MDC+S). RESULTS: The interobserver variability for TBC and TBC+S and for COVC and COVC+S were statistically significant (p = 0.021, 0.008, 0.002, 0.015). No significant difference was observed for TBS and COVS (p = 0.867, 0.061). Significant differences in interobserver variability were observed for MDC vs MDS, MDC vs MDC+S, MDS vs MDC+S (p = 0.000, 0.032, 0.008), the interobserver variability of MDS was smaller than that of MDC and MDC+S (MDS > MDC+S > MDC). CONCLUSIONS: When the SCS was 3 ~ 5 points and the number of surgical clips was >/=5, interobserver variability was minimal for the delineation of the tumour bed based on seroma."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 3DCT and 4DCT scan sets were acquired for 20 patients who underwent EB-PBI. The volume of the tumor bed (TB) was determined based on seroma or surgical clips on 3DCT images (defined as TB3D) and the end inhalation (EI) and end exhalation (EE) phases of 4DCT images (defined as TBEI and TBEE, respectively). The clinical target volume (CTV) consisted of the TB plus a 1.0 cm margin. The planning target volume (PTV) was the CTV plus 0.5 cm (defined as PTV3D, PTVEI, and PTVEE). For each patient, a conventional 3D conformal plan (3D-CRT) was generated (defined as EB-PBI3D, EB-PBIEI, and EB-PBIEE). RESULTS: The PTV3D, PTVEI, and PTVEE were similar (P=0.549), but the PTV coverage of EB-PBI3D was significantly less than that of EB-PBIEI or EB-PBIEE (P=0.001 and P=0.025, respectively). There were no significant differences in the homogeneity or conformity indexes between the three treatment plans (P=0.125 and P=0.536, respectively). The EB-PBI3D plan resulted in the largest organs at risk dose. CONCLUSION: There was a significant benefit for patients when using 3D-CRT based on 4DCT for EB-PBI with regard to reducing nontarget organ exposure. Respiratory motion did not affect the dosimetric distribution during free breathing, but might result in poor dose coverage when the PTV is determined using 3DCT."

In addition, we aimed to evaluate the patients who needed more or less complex treatment modalities. METHODS: Thirty patients were included in the study. All the patients had early-stage breast cancer and conserving surgery had been performed. Plans that employed the three techniques were generated for each patient. Dosimetric comparisons were conducted, and correlations with patient characteristics and dosimetric outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The 2D-RT technique was found to be suboptimal for treating the intact breast. Its dose homogeneity index (DHI) was 20.68. The authors were unable to define a patient characteristic in which 2D-RT dosimetry would perform better. FiF-IMRT was found to be the superior technique with a better homogeneity in the breast (DHI=9.35 and P=0.000002 when compared to 3D-CRT). When compared according to patient characteristics, again the FiF-IMRT planning is the best for all subgroups, but the DHI gets worse by increased breast volume and separation. While FiF-IMRT achieves better DHI in the breast, it has little effect on heart and lung doses. But the normal tissues' volume (cc) that gets the 100% of the prescribed dose (V100) was lowered because of the treatment without wedges and scatter and with less monitor unit. CONCLUSIONS: 2D-RT could not be performed safely on the intact breast in any of the subgroups. FiF-IMRT is a superior technique for breast dosimetry, and normal tissue. For patients with large breast size or separation, further intensive techniques must be investigated."

RESULTS: ASTRO's 5 recommendations for the Choosing Wisely campaign are the following: (1) Don't initiate whole-breast radiation therapy as a part of breast conservation therapy in women age >/=50 with early-stage invasive breast cancer without considering shorter treatment schedules; (2) don't initiate management of low-risk prostate cancer without discussing active surveillance; (3) don't routinely use extended fractionation schemes (>10 fractions) for palliation of bone metastases; (4) don't routinely recommend proton beam therapy for prostate cancer outside of a prospective clinical trial or registry; and (5) don't routinely use intensity modulated radiation therapy to deliver whole-breast radiation therapy as part of breast conservation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The ASTRO list for the Choosing Wisely campaign highlights radiation oncology interventions that should be discussed between physicians and patients before treatment is initiated. These 5 items provide opportunities to offer higher quality and less costly care."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, all patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy between 2005 and 2009 were screened, and qualifying consecutive patients were included in 1 of 2 cohorts: large-breasted patients (chest wall separation>25 cm or planning target volume [PTV]>1500 cm3) (n=97) and small-breasted patients (chest wall separation<25 cm and PTV<1500 cm3) (n=32). All patients were treated prone or supine with hypofractionated IMRT to the whole breast (42.4 Gy in 16 fractions) followed by a boost dose (9.6 Gy in 4 fractions). Dosimetric and clinical toxicity data were collected and analyzed using the R statistical package (version 2.12). RESULTS: The mean PTV V95 (percentage of volume receiving>=95% of prescribed dose) was 90.18% and the mean V105 percentage of volume receiving>=105% of prescribed dose was 3.55% with no dose greater than 107%. PTV dose was independent of breast size, whereas heart dose and maximum point dose to skin correlated with increasing breast size. Lung dose was markedly decreased in prone compared with supine treatments. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 0, 1, and 2 skin toxicities were noted acutely in 6%, 69%, and 25% of patients, respectively, and at later follow-up (>3 months) in 43%, 57%, and 0% of patients, respectively. Large breast size contributed to increased acute grade 2 toxicity (28% vs 12%, P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: Adequate PTV coverage with acceptable hot spots and excellent sparing of organs at risk was achieved by use of IMRT regardless of treatment position and breast size. Although increasing breast size leads to increased heart dose and maximum skin dose, heart dose remained within our institutional constraints and the incidence of overall skin toxicity was comparable to that reported in the literature. Taken together, these data suggest that hypofractionated radiation therapy using IMRT is a viable and appropriate therapeutic modality in large-breasted patients."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 09/00 and 09/10, 217 patients presenting an IBTR underwent lumpectomy and MCB (low, pulsed, or high-dose rate). Survival rates without second local recurrence (2nd LR), distant metastasis (DM), and overall survival (OS) were analysed as well as late effects and cosmetic results. Univariate and multivariate analyses (MVA) based on IBTR data were performed to find prognostic factors for 2nd LR, DM, and OS. RESULTS: Median follow-up after the IBTR was 3.9 years [range: 1.1-10.3]. Five and 10-year actuarial 2nd LR rates were 5.6% [range: 1.5-9.5] and 7.2% [range: 2.1-12.1], respectively. Five and 10-year actuarial DM rates were 9.6% [range: 5.7-15.2] and 19.1% [range: 7.8-28.3], respectively. Five and 10-year actuarial OS rates were 88.7% [range: 83.1-94.8] and 76.4% [range: 66.9-87.3], respectively. In MVA, histological grade was prognostic factor for 2nd LR (p=0.008) and OS (p=0.02); while tumour size was prognostic factor for DM (p=0.03). G3-4 complication rate was 11%.

M. on behalf of the, Import Trials Management Group",2014,Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation,,0,433,eng,"BACKGROUND: Whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) is the standard treatment for breast cancer following breast-conserving surgery. Evidence shows that tumour recurrences occur near the original cancer: the tumour bed. New treatment developments include increasing dose to the tumour bed during WBRT (synchronous integrated boost) and irradiating only the region around the tumour bed, for patients at high and low risk of tumour recurrence, respectively. Currently, standard imaging uses bony anatomy to ensure accurate delivery of WBRT. It is debatable whether or not more targeted treatments such as synchronous integrated boost and partial-breast radiotherapy require image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) focusing on implanted tumour bed clips (clip-based IGRT). OBJECTIVES: Primary - to compare accuracy of patient set-up using standard imaging compared with clip-based IGRT. Secondary - comparison of imaging techniques using (1) tumour bed radiotherapy safety margins, (2) volume of breast tissue irradiated around tumour bed, (3) estimated breast toxicity following development of a normal tissue control probability model and (4) time taken. DESIGN: Multicentre observational study embedded within a national randomised trial: IMPORT-HIGH (Intensity Modulated and Partial Organ Radiotherapy - HIGHer-risk patient group) testing synchronous integrated boost and using clip-based IGRT. SETTING: Five radiotherapy departments, participating in IMPORT-HIGH. PARTICIPANTS: Two-hundred and eighteen patients receiving breast radiotherapy within IMPORT-HIGH. INTERVENTIONS: There was no direct intervention in patients' treatment. Experimental and control intervention were clip-based IGRT and standard imaging, respectively. IMPORT-HIGH patients received clip-based IGRT as routine; standard imaging data were obtained from clip-based IGRT images. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in (1) set-up errors, (2) safety margins, (3) volume of breast tissue irradiated, (4) breast toxicity and (5) time, between clip-based IGRT and standard imaging. RESULTS: The primary outcome of overall mean difference in clip-based IGRT and standard imaging using daily set-up errors was 2-2.6 mm (p < 0.001). Heterogeneity testing between centres found a statistically significant difference in set-up errors at one centre. For four centres (179 patients), clip-based IGRT gave a mean decrease in the systematic set-up error of between 1 mm and 2 mm compared with standard imaging. Secondary outcomes were as follows: clip-based IGRT and standard imaging safety margins were less than 5 mm and 8 mm, respectively. Using clip-based IGRT, the median volume of tissue receiving 95% of prescribed boost dose decreased by 29 cm(3) (range 11-193 cm(3)) compared with standard imaging. Difference in median time required to perform clip-based IGRT compared with standard imaging was X-ray imaging technique dependent (range 8-76 seconds). It was not possible to estimate differences in breast toxicity, the normal tissue control probability model indicated that for breast fibrosis maximum radiotherapy dose is more important than volume of tissue irradiated. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: Margins of less than 8 mm cannot be used safely without clip-based IGRT for patients receiving concomitant tumour bed boost, as there is a risk of geographical miss of the tumour bed being treated. In principle, smaller but accurately placed margins may influence local control and toxicity rates, but this needs to be evaluated from mature clinical trial data in the future. FUNDING: This project is/was funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation (EME) programme, a MRC and NIHR partnership."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-seven patients with breast cancer with two computed tomography (CT) scans each had three CT registrations performed: (1) to bony anatomy, (2) to the center of mass (COM) of surgical clips, and (3) to the breast surface. The cavity COM was defined in both the initial and second CT scans after each type of registration, and distances between COMs (DeltaCOM(Bone), DeltaCOM(Clips), and DeltaCOM(Surface)) were determined. Smaller DeltaCOMs were interpreted as better localizations. Correlation coefficients were calculated for DeltaCOM vs. several variables. RESULTS: The DeltaCOM(Bone) (mean, 7 +/- 2 [SD] mm) increased with breast volume (r = 0.4; p = 0.02) and distance from the chest wall (r = 0.5; p = 0.003). Relative to bony registration, clip registration provided better localization (DeltaCOM(Clips) < DeltaCOM(Bone)) in 25 of 27 cases. Breast surface matching improved cavity localization (DeltaCOM(Surface) < DeltaCOM(Bone)) in 19 of 27 cases. Mean improvements (DeltaCOM(Bone) - DeltaCOM(Clips or Surface)) were 4 +/- 3 and 2 +/- 4 mm, respectively. In terms of percentage of improvement ([DeltaCOM(Bone) - DeltaCOM(Clips or Surface)]/DeltaCOM(Bone)), only surface matching showed a correlation with breast volume. Clip localization outperformed surface registration for cavities located superior to the breast COM. CONCLUSIONS: Use of either breast surface or surgical clips as surrogates for the cavity results in improved localization in most patients compared with bony registration and may allow smaller planning target volume margins for external beam accelerated partial breast irradiation. Compared with surface registration, clip registration may be less sensitive to anatomic characteristics and therefore more broadly applicable."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen patients treated with EB APBI underwent cone beam CT (CBCT) before each fraction and daily helical CT (HCT) scans to determine setup errors and calculate the dose per fraction. For 12 patients, an in-house image-intensity-based deformable registration program was used to register the HCTs to the planning CT and generate the cumulative dose. Treatment was 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions. EB APBI constraints from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B39/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0413 Phase III protocol were used. RESULTS: The mean setup error per CBCT registration was 9 +/- 5 mm. Dose-volume histogram analysis showed only one patient (8%) with a decrease in the CTV V90 (8% underdosage). All other patients demonstrated adequate target coverage. PTV_EVAL V90 was on average 3% (range, 0%-16%) less than planned. For the ipsilateral breast, four patients had an increase in V50 (</= 1% increase) and three patients had an increase in V100 (</= 9% increase). Only one patient showed an increase >5%. Four patients had an increase in ipsilateral lung V30 (maximum 3%), and one had an increase in heart V5 (1%). Four patients had an increase in MaxDose (maximum 89 cGy). CONCLUSIONS: The current CTV-to-PTV margin of 10 mm appears sufficient for approximately 92% of patients treated with EB APBI. Although expansion of the population PTV margin to 14 mm would provide approximately 97% confidence level for CTV coverage, online image guidance should be considered."

The aim was to compare 5-mm and 10-mm leaf widths for patients previously treated using PBI and assess subsequent planning target volume (PTV) coverage and organ at risk (OAR) doses for 16 patients. Several plans (5-mm leaf width or 10-mm leaf width) were generated for each patient using the original treated plan as the basis for attempts at further optimization. Alternating between different leaf widths found no significant difference in terms of overall PTV coverage and OAR doses between treatment plans. Optimization of the original treated plan allowed a small decrease in ipsilateral breast dose, which was offset by a lower PTV minimum. No significant dosimetric difference was found to support an advantage of 5-mm over 10-mm leaf width in this setting."

After conservative surgery for an infiltrating carcinoma, radiotherapy must be systematically performed, regardless of the characteristics of the disease, because it decreases the rate of local recurrence and by this way, specific mortality. Partial breast irradiation could not be proposed routinely but only in very selected and informed patients. For ductal carcinoma in situ, adjuvant radiotherapy must be also systematically performed after lumpectomy. After mastectomy, chest wall irradiation is required for pT3-T4 tumours and if there is an axillary nodal involvement, whatever the number of involved lymph nodes. After neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy, in case of pN0 disease, chest wall irradiation is recommended if there is a clinically or radiologically T3-T4 or node positive disease before chemotherapy. Axillary irradiation is recommended only if there is no axillary surgical dissection and a positive sentinel lymph node. Supra and infra-clavicular irradiation is advised in case of positive axillary nodes. Internal mammary irradiation must be discussed case by case, according to the benefit/risk ratio (cardiac toxicity). Dose to the chest wall or the breast must be between 45-50Gy with a conventional fractionation. A boost dose over the tumour bed is required if the patient is younger than 60 years old. Hypofractionation (42.5 Gy in 16 fractions, or 41.6 Gy en 13 or 40 Gy en 15) is possible after tumorectomy and if a nodal irradiation is not mandatory. Delineation of the breast, the chest wall and the nodal areas are based on clinical and radiological evaluations. 3D-conformal irradiation is the recommended technique, intensity-modulated radiotherapy must be proposed only in case of specific clinical situations. Respiratory gating could be useful to decrease the cardiac dose. Concomitant administration of chemotherapy in unadvised, but hormonal treatment could be start with radiotherapy."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 60 patients were treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for accelerated partial breast irradiation. Treatment planning and delivery were in strict accordance with the technique and specified dose-volume constraints of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-39/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0413 protocol. Late toxicity was evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading schema. The cosmetic outcome was scored using the Harvard criteria. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation of dosimetric variables with outcome. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 15 months, moderate-to-severe late toxicity developed in 10% of patients. The most pronounced late toxicity was subcutaneous fibrosis: 25% Grade 2-4 and 8.3% Grade 3-4. The modified planning tumor volume/whole breast volume ratio, ratio of the volume of breast tissue receiving 5%, 20%, 50%, and 80% of the prescription dose to the whole breast volume, and maximal dose within the breast correlated with the development of fibrosis (p = .10, p = .03, p = .04, p = .06, p = .09, and p = .046, respectively). The overall cosmetic outcome was good to excellent in 81.7%, fair in 11.7%, and poor in 6.7%. The presence of subcutaneous fibrosis, modified planning tumor volume/whole breast volume ratio, ratio of the volume of breast tissue receiving 5% and 20% of the prescription dose to the whole breast volume, and pathologic specimen volume correlated with the risk of a fair/poor cosmetic outcome (p < .001, p = .02, p = .05, p = .04, p = .01, respectively). CONCLUSION: The three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy technique for accelerated partial breast irradiation as specified in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-39/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0413 protocol resulted in a remarkably high rate of moderate-to-severe late normal tissue effects, despite the relatively brief follow-up period.

The main objective of postoperative radiotherapy is sterilization of residual cancer cells. Whole-breast radiotherapy is the standard of care, but its utility has recently been challenged in favor of radiotherapy limited to the area at highest risk of recurrence. Intraoperative electron radiotherapy (IOeRT) is an innovative technique for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) that is applied to selected patients affected by early breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience with IOeRT at the Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa since we began utilizing this modality in 2006. METHODS: From April 2006 to September 2010, 31 patients affected by unifocal invasive duct breast carcinoma < or = 2 cm diameter received wide local resection followed by intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons. Patients were evaluated for early and late complications, and other events, 1 month after surgery and every 3 months thereafter for the duration of the first 2 years. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 36 months, seven patients developed mild breast fibrosis and three suffered from mild postoperative infection. Rib fractures were observed in four patients before routine lead shielding was initiated. Additional whole-breast irradiation was given to four patients. None of the patients developed local recurrences or other ipsilateral cancers. Similarly, no contralateral cancers or distant metastases were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative electron radiotherapy may be an alternative to external beam radiation therapy in an appropriate selected group of early-stage breast cancer patients. However, long-term results of clinical trials are required to better evaluate the indications and utility of this technique in the management of breast cancer."

The steep radial dose gradient implies reduced tumor cell control with increasing depth in the tumor bed. The purpose was to compare the expected risk of local recurrence in this nonuniform radiation field with that after conventional external beam radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The relative biologic effectiveness of low-energy photons was modeled using the linear-quadratic formalism including repair of sublethal lesions during protracted irradiation. Doses of 50-kV X-rays (Intrabeam) were converted to equivalent fractionated doses, EQD2, as function of depth in the tumor bed. The probability of local control was estimated using a logistic dose-response relationship fitted to clinical data from fractionated radiotherapy. RESULTS: The model calculations show that, for a cohort of patients, the increase in local control in the high-dose region near the applicator partly compensates the reduction of local control at greater distances. Thus a sphere of equivalence"" exists within which the risk of recurrence is equal to that after external fractionated radiotherapy. The spatial distribution of recurrences inside this sphere will be different from that after conventional radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: A novel target volume concept is presented here. The incidence of recurrences arising in the tumor bed around the excised tumor will test the validity of this concept and the efficacy of the treatment. Recurrences elsewhere will have implications for the rationale of TARGIT."""

METHODS: Paired fluoroscopic images were acquired simultaneously using orthogonal kV X-ray imaging systems at pre- and post-treatment for 23 patients who underwent APBI with external beam radiotherapy. The internal target motion was calculated from the surgical clips placed around the tumour cavity. RESULTS: The peak-to-peak respiratory-induced motions ranged from 0.6 to 1.5mm in all directions. A systematic baseline drift of 1.5mm towards the posterior direction and a random baseline drift of 0.3mm in the lateral-medial and cranial-caudal directions were observed. The baseline for an outer tumour cavity drifted towards the lateral and posterior directions, and that for an upper tumour cavity drifted towards the cranial direction. Moderate correlations were observed between the posterior baseline drift and the patients' physical characteristics. The posterior margin for intrafractional uncertainties was larger than 5mm in patients with greater fat thickness due to the baseline drift. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the intrafractional motion was not uniform according to the direction, patients' physical characteristics, or tumour cavity location due to the baseline drift. Therefore, the intrafractional systematic movement should be properly managed."

We assessed the mean heart dose (MHD) of RT and estimated the risk of RT-associated cardiac toxicity in women undergoing adjuvant RT for breast cancer in contemporary (predominantly) community practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified women with left-sided breast cancer receiving adjuvant RT between 2012 and 2014 from 94 centers across 16 states. We used bivariate analyses and multivariable linear regression to assess associations between RT techniques and MHD. Excess RT-related cardiac risk by age 80 was estimated for women diagnosed at age 60 using the previously reported relationship between MHD and cardiac risk. RESULTS: Among 1161 women, 77.3% were treated in community practice and with breast conservation (77.8%). The most common techniques were free-breathing (92.2%), supine (94.8%), and fixed gantry intensity modulated RT (FG-IMRT; 46.9%). The median MHD was 2.76 Gy (interquartile range, 1.47-5.03). In multivariable analyses, the predicted median MHD with deep inspiration breath hold was 2.41 Gy compared with 3.86 Gy with free-breathing (P < .001). Three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) was associated with a lower predicted median MHD (2.78 Gy) than FG-IMRT (4.02 Gy) or rotational IMRT, 6.60 Gy, P < .001). For 60-year-old women with the median MHD of the study population (2.76 Gy) and no cardiovascular risk factors, the 20-year predicted excess risk of death from ischemic heart disease attributable to radiation was 3.5 excess events/1000 patients, in contrast to estimates of 8 events/1000 from prior analyses. The predicted risk of cardiac events varied based on radiation technique, with 4 excess events/1000 with 3D-CRT, 5 excess events/1000 with FG-IMRT, and 8 excess events/1000 with rotational IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: MHD varies substantially across patients and is influenced by technique in predominantly community settings. Overall risk of cardiac toxicity is modest."

RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2011, 180 women who met inclusion criteria for APBI underwent breast MRI prior to treatment (median age=59; range 38-86). 126 tumors (70%) were invasive carcinomas with or without associated DCIS, while 54 (30%) were pure DCIS. Breast MRI confirmed unifocal disease in 109 patients with 111 cancers (60.5% of MRI cohort). Multifocal disease was identified in 19 patients (10.5% of MRI cohort), while multicentric disease was present in 3 patients (1.6% of MRI cohort). Five patients (4%) had an MRI-detected contralateral cancer. False positive MRI findings were seen in 45 patients (25% of MRI cohort). Pre-menopausal patients and patients with tumors >2 cm were more likely to have MRI-detected multifocal/multicentric disease. While there was no statistically significant correlation between multifocal/multicentric disease and breast density, tumor histology, grade, ER status, or Her2/Neu expression, numbers in each category were small, suggesting a lack of statistical power to detect differences that may be clinically meaningful. One hundred and fifty-two of the 180 patients (84.4%) successfully completed lumpectomy and APBI, while 6.7% of the cohort underwent mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Breast MRI identified additional disease in 12% of APBI candidates. Premenopausal women and patients with tumors >2 cm were more likely to have MRI-detected multifocal/multicentric disease."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women aged 40 years or older with unifocal invasive or intraductal carcinoma </=2.5 cm on physical examination, mammography, and ultrasound (US) were evaluated with breast MRI before enrollment on an APBI trial using single-fraction intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) or fractionated 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Abnormal MRI findings were evaluated with US-guided or MRI-guided biopsy. RESULTS: Between December 2002 and March 2005, 51 women (median age=61 y; range, 40 to 83 y) who met inclusion criteria underwent breast MRI before APBI. MRI demonstrated limited disease in 41 patients (80.4%): 34 received APBI using IORT (22) or 3DCRT (12), whereas 7 elected standard whole-breast radiotherapy. Ten of the 51 patients (19.6%) had indeterminate or suspicious enhancement patterns on MRI. Five of these 10 (9.8% of MRI cohort) underwent US-guided or MRI-guided biopsy revealing normal breast tissue without atypia: 3 were treated with APBI using IORT (5.9% of MRI cohort) and 2 underwent standard breast conservation therapy (3.9% of MRI cohort). The remaining 5 patients (9.8% of MRI cohort) had MRI findings revealing previously unsuspected pectoral fascia involvement (1), multifocal disease (3), or multicentric disease (1): 2 were treated with standard breast conservation therapy, whereas 3 underwent mastectomy without adjuvant radiotherapy.

However, treatment-related morbidities have been linked to the large postoperative treatment volumes required for external beam PBI. Relative to external beam delivery, alternative PBI techniques require equipment that is not universally available. To address these issues, we designed a phase 1 trial utilizing widely available technology to 1) evaluate the safety of a single radiation treatment delivered preoperatively to the small-volume, intact breast tumor and 2) identify imaging and genomic markers of radiation response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Women aged >/=55 years with clinically node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive, and/or progesterone receptor-positive HER2-, T1 invasive carcinomas, or low- to intermediate-grade in situ disease </=2 cm were enrolled (n=32). Intensity modulated radiation therapy was used to deliver 15 Gy (n=8), 18 Gy (n=8), or 21 Gy (n=16) to the tumor with a 1.5-cm margin. Lumpectomy was performed within 10 days. Paired pre- and postradiation magnetic resonance images and patient tumor samples were analyzed. RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. At a median follow-up of 23 months, there have been no recurrences. Physician-rated cosmetic outcomes were good/excellent, and chronic toxicities were grade 1 to 2 (fibrosis, hyperpigmentation) in patients receiving preoperative radiation only. Evidence of dose-dependent changes in vascular permeability, cell density, and expression of genes regulating immunity and cell death were seen in response to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative single-dose radiation therapy to intact breast tumors is well tolerated. Radiation response is marked by early indicators of cell death in this biologically favorable patient cohort. This study represents a first step toward a novel partial breast radiation approach. Preoperative radiation should be tested in future clinical trials because it has the potential to challenge the current treatment paradigm and provide a path forward to identify radiation response biomarkers."

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Twelve SBBC patients with pTis-2N0M0 stages who underwent whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery were planned with F-IMRT and tP-VMAT techniques prescribing 42.56 Gy (2.66 Gy*16f) to the breast. The F-IMRT used 8-12 jaw-fixed tangential fields with single (sF-IMRT) or two (F-IMRT) isocenters located under the sternum or in the center of the left and right planning target volumes (PTVs), and tP-VMAT used 4 tangential partial arcs with two isocenters located in the center of the left and right PTVs. Plan evaluation was based on dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis. Dosimetric parameters were calculated to evaluate plan quality; total monitor units (MUs), and the gamma analysis for patient-specific quality assurance (QA) were also evaluated. RESULTS: For PTVs, the three plans had similar Dmean and conformity index (CI) values. F-IMRT showed a slightly better target coverage according to the V100% values and demonstrated an obvious reduction in V105% and Dmax compared with the values observed for sF-IMRT and tP-VMAT. Compared with tP-VMAT, sF-IMRT was slightly better in terms of V100% , V105% and Dmax . In addition, F-IMRT achieved the best homogeneity index (HI) values for PTVs. Concerning healthy tissue, tP-VMAT had an advantage in minimizing the high dose volume. The MUs of the tP-VMAT plan were decreased approximately 1.45 and 1 times compared with the sF-IMRT and F-IMRT plans, respectively, and all plans passed QA. For the lungs, heart and liver, F-IMRT achieved the smallest values in terms of Dmean and showed a significant difference compared with tP-VMAT. Simultaneously, sF-IMRT was also superior to tP-VMAT. For the coronary artery, tP-VMAT achieved the lowest Dmean , while the value for F-IMRT was 2.24% lower compared with sF-IMRT. For all organs at risk (OARs), tP-VMAT was superior at the high dose level. In contrast, sF-IMRT and F-IMRT were obviously superior at the low dose level. The sF-IMRT and F-IMRT plans showed consistent trends. CONCLUSION: All treatment plans for the provided techniques were of high quality and feasible for SBBC patients. However, we recommend F-IMRT with a single isocenter as a priority technique because of the tremendous advantage of local hot spot control in PTVs and the reduced dose to OARs at low dose levels. When the irradiated dose to the lungs and heart exceed the clinical restriction, two isocenter F-IMRT can be used to maximize OAR sparing. Additionally, tP-VMAT can be adopted for improving cold spots in PTVs or high-dose exposure to normal tissue when the interval between PTVs is narrow."

Target delineation is the most important process, which determines the accuracy of planning and application of IMRT. However, there is no consensus criterion for the delineation of clinical target volume (CTV) of intact breast. This study was to investigate the factors influencing the delineation of CTV of intact breast in IMRT for breast cancer. METHODS: The CTV of intact breast in 6 patients was delineated by 4 radiation oncologists and 1 radiologist individually, and reference CTV was determined by group consensus. The extent of variation in CTV delineation was quantified by the ratio of common volumes (Vco) of all CTVs to the maximum volume encompassing all CTVs (Vmax). The deviation in the extent of CTV from the extent of reference CTV was quantified in each orthogonal direction to find the origins of variations. In addition, all central lung distances (CLD) in tangential fields, which were designed based on CTVs, were measured. RESULTS: The ratios of Vco to Vmax were low (0.660 and 0.651, respectively) in 2 patients with low glandular density. Among the other 4 patients with high glandular density, the ratio was relatively higher in 2 patients with radio-opaque marks than in the other 2 patients with no marks (0.799, 0.769 vs. 0.735, 0.752, respectively). Compared with reference CTVs, the patients' average deviations of the extent of CTVs were 0 in anterior direction, (1.2+/-3.4) mm in posterior direction, (1.5+/-2.1) mm in cranial direction, (0.7+/-4.1) mm in caudal direction, (0.6+/-3.3) mm in medial direction, and (0.8+/-0.8) mm in lateral direction. The most obvious variations were observed in the area of breast axillary part and primary tumor bed after surgery. The mean CLD in 4 patients exceeded over the conventional limitation of 2 cm. CONCLUSION: The variability between CTVs of intact breast delineated by different radiation oncologists is strongly related to individual glandular density, the extent of breast axillary part, the primary tumor bed after surgery, and the different understanding for lung sparing limitations."

Postoperative radiotherapy is conventionally delivered with conventional wedged tangential fields. However, intensity modulation in radiotherapy helps to maximize tumor control while minimizing damage to normal tissues. This study was to evaluate the potential dosimetric benefits and optimal indications of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for the intact breast. METHODS: Ten patients with stage Tis-2N0M0 breast cancer, who received breast-conserving surgery, were selected for this study. A dosimetric comparison of forward planning IMRT with conventional wedged tangential technique was performed on each patient using three-dimensional treatment planning. The total prescribed dose for both plans was 5000 cGy/25 fractions. Dose volume histograms (DVH) were used to compare the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risks (OARs) such as ipsilateral lung, contralateral breast, contralateral lung for all patients, and coronary arteries, heart for left sided patients, and liver for right sided patients. RESULTS: The PTV coverage in IMRT plan was similar to that of the conventional plan (97.7% vs. 98.3%). A better dose uniformity throughout the whole breast was achieved by IMRT plan. The percentage of PTV receiving less than 95% prescribed dose and more than 103% prescribed dose (inhomogeneity index, IHI) decreased from 29.9% to 2.9%; the percentage of PTV receiving more than 105% prescribed dose (V105%) decreased from 28.2% to 0.6%. A better amelioration of IHI and reduction of V105% in IMRT plans were observed in the relatively large PTV subgroup. Obvious reduction in the doses to OARs was achieved by IMRT plan. The maximum dose (D(max)) of coronary artery decreased from 5057.1 cGy to 4832.9 cGy, and the mean dose (D(mean)) of heart decreased from 629.8 cGy to 450.7 cGy; the Dmean of liver decreased from 283.9 cGy to 172.0 cGy for right sided patients; the Dmean and percentage of volume receiving more than 20 Gy (V20) of ipsilateral lung decreased from 925.2 cGy to 765.9 cGy, and from 16.0% to 15.3%, respectively; the Dmean and V20 of different central lung distance (CLD) subgroups decreased by 14.7% and 20.9%, 7.0% and 12.9%, respectively; the Dmean of contralateral breast decreased from 75.4 cGy to 20.3 cGy; the Dmean of contralateral lung decreased from 30.9 cGy to 16.1 cGy. CONCLUSION: Forward planning IMRT based on a standard tangential beam arrangement significantly improves the dose homogeneity throughout the target volume of intact breast, and reduces the dose to OARs, especially in patients with large breast volumes or exceeded CLD, who might be proposed as candidates of IMRT for intact breast."

However, this article presents an exploration of the possibility of achieving higher conformal avoidance of sensitive structures through detailed and comparative 3D CT-based anatomical dose distribution of a patient in supine and prone positions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A patient treated with accelerated partial breast HDR breast brachytherapy in the supine position was selected for two CT-based analyses, one in the supine and one in the prone position. The optimized plan (Nucletron HDR planning station) for each position was achieved using graphical optimization with local adjustment of isodose lines to cover the planned target volume (PTV, lumpectomy with 2 cm margin) with 100% of the prescribed dose (34 Gy in 10 fractions) while minimizing the hot spots. Cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVH) were analyzed for the PTV, lung, skin, pectoral muscle, and chest wall. RESULTS: The PTV received 100% of prescribed dose in both the prone and supine positions. A significant (>40%) dose reduction was achieved in the lung in the prone treatment position. Similar dose reductions were also achieved for prone pectoral muscle, chest wall, and breast skin, irradiating less volume with high doses. Pectoral muscle, lumpectomy, and the breast skin showed prominent differences in shape and displacement in the prone compared with the supine position. CONCLUSION: CT-based treatment planning allowed calculations of volumetric dose distribution to the target and all sensitive structures with proper visualization and volumetric delineation of organs of interest. The treatment plan shows significant dose reduction may be possible in various sensitive structures if the patient is treated with HDR brachytherapy in the prone position."

We report on our experience with an adaptive radiation therapy (ART) strategy involving rescanning and replanning patients to take this reduction into account during a course of intensity-modulated radiation therapy with simultaneously integrated boost (IMRT-SIB). MATERIALS: From April 2007 till December 2009, 1274 patients eligible for SIB treatment were enrolled into this protocol. Patients for which the time between the initial planning CT (CT(1)) and lumpectomy was less than 30 days and who had an initial seroma volume >30 cm(3) were rescanned at day 10 of treatment (CT(2)) and replanned when significant changes were observed by the radiation oncologist. Patients received 28 fractions of 1.81 Gy to the breast and 2.30 Gy to the boost volume. RESULTS: Nine percent (n=113) of the 1274 patients enrolled met the criteria and were rescanned. Of this group, 77% (n=87) of treatment plans were adapted. Time between surgery and CT(1) (20 days versus 20 days for adapted and non-adapted plans, p=0.89) and time between CT(1) and CT(2) (21 days versus 22 days for adapted and non-adapted plans, p=0.43) revealed no procedural differences which might have biased our results. In the adapted plans, seroma decreased significantly from 60 to 27 cm(3) (p<0.001), TBV from 70 to 45 cm(3) (p<0.001) and PTV(boost) from 277 to 220 cm(3) (p<0.001). The volume receiving more than 95% of the boost dose (V(95%(total-dose))) could be reduced by 19% (linear fit, R(2)=0.73) from on average 360 to 292 cm(3) (p<0.001). Delay in treatment and the use of a prolonged treatment schedule with different fractionation for patients with seroma could thus be prevented. CONCLUSION: The adaptive radiation therapy IMRT-SIB procedure has proven to be efficient and effective, leading to a clinically significant reduction of the high dose volume. Seroma present in a subgroup of patients referred for breast radiation therapy does not hamper the introduction of highly conformal IMRT-SIB techniques."

The fractionation schedule comprised 50 Gy in 25 fractions given to supraclavicular and axillary apex nodes and to whole breast (after BCS) or chest wall (after mastectomy). Two opposite 50 degrees -60 degrees width arcs were employed for breast ad chest wall irradiation, while a single VMAT arc was used for nodal treatment. Treatment was generally well tolerated. Acute skin toxicity was G2 in 13.3% of patients. Late skin toxicity consisted of G1 induration/fibrosis in six patients (13.3%) and G2 in 1 (2.2%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of patients with early breast cancer underwent conservative surgery with placement of surgical titanium clips (at least three clips required). All patients had a treatment planning computed tomography simulation before (CT1) and after surgery (CT2). The two sets of images were co-registered with a match point registration. The relationship between the clips-based CTV for PBI delineated on CT2 and the initial tumour location on CT1 was studied, evaluating the percentage of intersection volume. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients participated in this study. In total, 13 patients (46.4%) had an intersection volume >/= 50% and 10 patients (35.7%) had complete intersection (intersection volume = 100%). An increased median intersection volume was observed in patients with more than six clips (P = 0.007) and in patients with a larger portion of breast volume covered by the PBI-CTV (CTV/BV; P = 0.010). Intersection volume increased with the number of clips, after adjustment for CTV/BV (linear coefficient = 5.1693; P = 0.043). Also, a maximum distance from the chest wall </=0.7 cm and CTV/BV > 9.5% were found to be predictors of an intersection volume >/=50% (area under the curve 0.841; confidence interval 0.649-0.952; P < 0.0001; area under the curve 0.800; confidence interval 0.607-0.926; P = 0.0004) and of an intersection volume of 100% (area under the curve 0.776, confidence interval 0.573-0.916, P = 0.046; area under the curve 0.752, confidence interval 0.536-0.935; P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Titanium clips are essential and six or more increase the accuracy of tumour bed delineation for PBI; also the primary tumour location as well as the percentage of volume of breast covered by PBI-CTV may influence the correct delineation of PBI-CTV."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with LABC suitable for BCT following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CAF/CEF) were accrued in the study. Conventional RT (CRT) to the whole breast was delivered 5 days a week to a dose of 50Gy using 6-10MV photons. In addition, an electron boost to the tumour bed was delivered every Saturday, eventually delivering 5 such weekly fractions to a boost dose of 12.5Gy. Patients were evaluated for acute reactions during the treatment and cosmetic evaluation was done before, at the end of radiation therapy and at follow up by 2 independent observers blinded to each other. The study population (concomitant boost (CB) group) was compared with a similar cohort of 32 patients treated conventionally with tumour bed boost of 15Gy in 6 fractions delivered after the completion of whole breast irradiation (CRT group). RESULTS: All patients completed RT within the stipulated time with no grade IV skin toxicity in either group. At conclusion of RT, in the CB group, confluent moist desquamation (grade III) developed within the tumour bed region in 1 patient (3.3%) and outside tumour bed region in 3 patients (10%). In the CRT group, 3 and 4 patients (9.4% and 12%) developed moist desquamation within and outside the tumour bed regions, respectively. CB did not affect the global cosmesis as compared with CRT group (p=0.23) at the end of 3 years. CONCLUSION: Concomitant tumour bed boost along with whole breast RT appears to be safe and feasible in a select group of patients. As the treatment is completed earlier by 6-10 days than conventional practice, it has favourable time and resource implications, particularly attractive for patients travelling long distances for treatment. Based on these encouraging results, we are planning to confirm the results in an appropriately designed and powered randomised trial."

A boost to the tumour bed after whole breast radiotherapy is employed in view of the pattern of tumour bed recurrences in the index quadrant and was particularly considered in patients with some adverse histopathological characteristics such as positive margins, extensive intraductal carcinoma (EIC), lymphovascular invasion dose in patients even without such factors and for all age groups. The maximum absolute reduction of local recurrences by the addition of boost is especially seen in young premenopausal patients. At the same time, the addition of boost is associated with increased risk of worsening of cosmesis and no clear cut survival advantage. Radiological modalities such as fluoroscopy, ultrasound and CT scan have aided in accurate delineation of tumour bed with increasing efficacy. A widespread application of these techniques might ultimately translate into improved local control with minimal cosmetic deficit. The present article discusses the role of radiotherapy boost and the means to delineate and deliver the same, identify the high risk group, optimal technique and the doses and fractionations to be used.

The purpose of this analysis is to present 5- and 7-year outcomes following APBI based on CS groupings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 690 patients with early-stage breast cancer underwent APBI from 1993 to 2012, receiving interstitial brachytherapy (n=195), balloon-based brachytherapy (n=290), or 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (n=205) at a single institution. Patients were stratified into suitable, cautionary, and unsuitable groups with 5-year outcomes analyzed. Seven-year outcomes were analyzed for a subset with follow-up of >/=2 years (n=625). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 6.7 years (range, 0.1 to 20.1 y). Patients assigned to cautionary and unsuitable categories were more likely to have high-grade tumors (21% to 25% vs. 9%, P=0.001), receive chemotherapy (15% to 38% vs. 6%, P<0.001), and have close/positive margins (9% to 11% vs. 0%, P<0.001). There was no difference in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence at 5 or 7 years: 2.2%, 1.2%, 2.8% at 5 years (P=0.57), and 2.2%, 1.9%, 4.6% at 7 years (P=0.58) in the suitable, cautionary, and unsuitable groups, respectively. As compared with the suitable group, increased rates of distant metastases were noted for the unsuitable and cautionary groups at 5 years (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: No differences in rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence were seen at 5 or 7 years when stratified by ASTRO CS groupings. Modest increases in distant recurrence were noted in the cautionary and unsuitable groups. These findings suggest that the ASTRO CS groupings stratify more for systemic recurrence and may not appropriately select patients for whole versus partial breast irradiation."

However intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has also been advocated as a means of lowering heart doses. There is currently no large-scale, long-term follow-up data after breast IMRT and, since dose distributions may differ from classic tangent-based radiotherapy, caution is needed to avoid unexpected worsening of the late toxicity profile. We compared four IMRT techniques for free-breathing left-breast irradiation. Consistent with the aforementioned concerns, our goal in planning was to prioritize organ at risk (OAR) sparing in a way that mimicked tangent-based radiotherapy. Ten simultaneous integrated boost treatment plans (PTVelective = 15 x 2.67 Gy; PTVboost = 15 x 3.35 Gy) were created using 1) hybrid-IMRT (H-IMRT), 2) full IMRT (F-IMRT), and 3) volumetric-modulated arc therapy with two partial arcs (2ARC) and 4) six partial arcs (6ARC). Reduction in OAR mean and low dose was prioritized. End-points included OAR sparing (e.g., heart, left anterior descending artery [LAD+3 mm], lungs, and contralateral breast) and PTV coverage/dose homogeneity. Under these conditions we found the following: 1) H-IMRT provided the best mean and low dose OAR sparing, PTVelective coverage (mean V95% = 98%), PTVboost coverage (V95% = 98%), and PTV homogeneity. However, it delivered most intermediate-high dose to the heart, LAD+3 mm and ipsilateral lung; 2) 6ARC had the best intermediate-high dose sparing, followed by F-IMRT, but this was at the expense of more dose in the contralateral lung and breast and worse PTV coverage (PTVelective mean V95% = 96%/97% and PTVboost mean V95% = 91%/96% for 6ARC/F-IMRT). When trying to spare mean and low dose to OARs, the preferred IMRT technique for left-breast irradiation without breath-hold was H-IMRT. This is currently the standard solution in our institution for left-breast radiotherapy under free-breathing and breath-hold conditions."

We compared the accuracy of conventional tattoo-based setups to a patient setup without tattoos. MATERIALS/METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients receiving APBI at our institution from July 10, 2017 to February 13, 2018 were identified. All patients received tattoos per standard of care. Ten patients underwent setup using tattoos for initial positioning followed by surface imaging and 2D matching of surgical clips. The other ten patients underwent positioning using surface imaging followed by 2D matching without reference to tattoos. Overall setup time and orthogonal x-ray-based shifts after surface imaging per fraction were recorded. Shift data were used to calculate systematic and random error. RESULTS: Among ten patients in the no tattoo"" group, the average setup time per fraction was 6.83 min vs 8.03 min in the tattoo cohort (P < 0.01). Mean 3D vector shifts for patients in the ""no tattoo"" group were 4.6 vs 5.9 mm in the ""tattoo"" cohort (P = NS). Mean systematic errors in the ""no tattoo"" group were: 1.2 mm (1.5 mm SD) superior/inferior, 0.5 mm (1.6 mm SD) right/left, and 2.3 mm (1.9 mm SD) anterior/posterior directions. Mean systematic errors in the ""tattoo"" group were: 0.8 mm (2.2 mm SD) superior/inferior, 0.3 mm (2.5 mm SD) right/left, and 1.4 mm (4.4 mm SD) anterior/posterior directions. The random errors in the ""no tattoo"" group ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 mm vs 1.2 to 1.7 mm in the ""tattoo"" group. CONCLUSIONS: Using both surface imaging and 2D matching to surgical clips provides excellent accuracy in APBI patient alignment and setup verification with reduced setup time relative to the tattoo cohort.

METHODS AND MATERIAL: For each of 11 patient studies, one proton plan, one IMRT, and two conventional (tangential and patched) plans were calculated using a three-dimensional treatment-planning system, Helax-TMS(). The evaluation of the different treatment plans was made by applying the normal tissue complication probability model (NTCP) proposed by Kallman (also denoted the relative seriality model) on the dose distributions in terms of dose-volume histograms. The organs at risk are the spinal cord, the left lung, the heart, and the non-critical normal tissues (including the right breast). RESULTS: The comparison demonstrated that the proton treatment plans provide significantly lower NTCP values for the heart and lung when compared to conventional radiation qualities including IMRT for all 11 patients. At a prescribed dose of 50 Gy in the PTV, the calculated mean NTCP value for the patients decreased, on the average, from 14.7 to 0.6% for the lung (radiation pneumonitis) for the proton plans compared with the best plan using conventional radiation qualities. The corresponding figures for the heart (cardiac mortality) were from 2.1 to 0.5%. The figures for cardiac mortality for IMRT, tangential technique and the patched technique were 2.2, 6.7, and 2.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Protons appear to have major advantages in terms of lower complication risks when compared with treatments using conventional radiation qualities for treating node-positive left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery."

Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) field-in-field (FIF) plans with simultaneous and sequential boost and IMRT SIB plans were generated for the datasets of 20 patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgery. The 3 plans were compared dosimetrically for efficiency in terms of planning target volume (PTV) coverage (PTV 95%), homogeneity and conformity, dose delivered to ipsilateral/contralateral lungs (I/L: V10, V20, C/L: Vmean, V5), heart and contralateral breast (Vmean, V30 for heart and Vmean, V1, V5 for C/L breast). Results: The FIF 3DCRT plan with SIB (PLAN B) was more homogeneous than the classical technique with sequential boost (PLAN A). There were less hot spots in terms of Dmax (63.7 +/- 1.3) versus Dmax (68.9 +/- 1), P < 0.001 and boost V107%, B (0.3 +/- 0.7) versus A (3.5 +/- 5.99), P = 0.001. The IMRT SIB (PLAN C) did not provide any significant dosimetric advantage over the 3DCRT SIB technique. IMRT SIB plan C was associated with increased dose to contralateral lung in-terms of V5 (10.35 +/- 18.23) vs. (1.13 +/- 4.24), P = 0.04 and Vmean (2.12 +/- 2.18) versus Vmean (0.595 +/- 0.89), P = 0.008. There was 3-fold greater exposure in terms of Monitor Unit (MU) (1024.9 +/- 298.32 versus 281.05 +/- 20.23, P < 0.001) and treatment delivery time. Conclusions: FIF 3DCRT SIB provides a dosimetrically acceptable and technically feasible alternative to the classical 3DCRT plan with sequential boost for breast-conserving radiotherapy. It reduces treatment time by 2 weeks. IMRT SIB does not appear to have any dosimetric advantage; it is associated with significantly higher doses to contralateral lung and heart and radiation exposure in terms of MU."

The authors evaluate the plan quality and delivery efficiency and accuracy of this dynamic technique with a conventional flat 6 MV photon beam. METHODS: Burst-delivery rIMRT was implemented in a planning system and delivered with a 160-MLC linac. Ten rIMRT plans were generated for five anonymized patient cases encompassing head and neck, brain, prostate, and prone breast. All plans were analyzed retrospectively and not used for treatment. Among the varied plan parameters were the number of optimization points, number of arcs, gantry speed, and gantry angle range (alpha) over which the beam is turned on at each optimization point. Combined rotational/step-and-shoot rIMRT plans were also created by superimposing multiple-segment static fields at several optimization points. The rIMRT trial plans were compared with each other and with plans generated using helical tomotherapy and VMAT. Burst-mode rotational IMRT plans were delivered and verified using a diode array, ionization chambers, thermoluminescent dosimeters, and film. RESULTS: Burst-mode rIMRT can achieve plan quality comparable to helical tomotherapy, while the former may lead to slightly better OAR sparing for certain cases and the latter generally achieves slightly lower hot spots. Few instances were found in which increasing the number of optimization points above 36, or superimposing step-and-shoot IMRT segments, led to statistically significant improvements in OAR sparing. Using an additional rIMRT partial arc yielded substantial OAR dose improvements for the brain case. Measured doses from the rIMRT plan delivery were within 4% of the plan calculation in low dose gradient regions. Delivery time range was 228-375 s for single-arc rIMRT 200-cGy prescription with a 300 MU/min dose rate, comparable to tomotherapy and VMAT. CONCLUSIONS: Rotational IMRT with burst delivery, whether combined with static fields or not, yields clinically acceptable and deliverable treatment plans."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For our pilot study, we generated helical tomotherapy plans upon the images of 10 prone-positioned patients previously treated using conventional techniques. We also generated plans for 4 left-breast prone-positioned PBI patients who were treated using helical tomotherapy, and recalculated the planned sinograms upon the pretreatment megavoltage computed tomographic images. Of the planning target volume (PTV), 95% was prescribed to receive 38.5 Gy, administered twice daily for 5 days. RESULTS: For our pilot study, on average the maximum point dose to the PTV was 41.3 Gy, and 99% or more of the PTV received 90% or more of the prescribed dose. RTOG 0413 dose-volume histogram objectives were fulfilled for all organs at risk except the contralateral breast, which received a maximum point dose as high as 3.2 Gy in 1 case.

Dose calculation using the planned sinogram upon the pretreatment megavoltage computed tomographic images indicated consistency with the planned dose distributions. CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy can provide conformal and uniform target-dose coverage simultaneous with adequate sparing of critical structures; in this study only the contralateral breast dose exceeded RTOG 0413 guidelines. Dosimetric results for our 4 prospective patient cases were consistent with those for our 10-case pilot study."

Normal tissue integral dose (NTID),0,482,eng,"BACKGROUND: Adjuvant radiotherapy is the standard treatment after breast-conserving surgery. According to meta-analyses, adjuvant 3d-conventional irradiation reduces the risk of local recurrence and thereby improves long-term survival by 5-10%. However, there is an unintended exposure of organs such as the heart, lungs and contralateral breast. Irradiation of the left breast has been related to long-term effects like increased rates of coronary events as well as second cancer induction. Modern radiotherapy techniques such as tangential intensity modulated radiotherapy (t-IMRT) and tangential volumetric modulated arc therapy (t-VMAT) and particularly deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) technique have been developed in order to improve coverage of target volume and to reduce dose to normal tissue. The aim of this study was to compare t-IMRT-plans with t-VMAT-plans in DIBH position for left-sided breast irradiation in terms of normal tissue exposure, i.e. of lungs, heart, left anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA), as well as homogeneity (HI) and conformity index (CI) and excess absolute risk (EAR) for second cancer induction for organs at risk (OAR) after irradiation. METHODS: Twenty patients, diagnosed with left-sided breast cancer and treated with breast-preserving surgery, were included in this planning study. For each patient DIBH-t-IMRT plan using 5 to 7 beams and t-VMAT plan using four rotations were generated to achieve 95% dose coverage to 95% of the volume. Data were evaluated on the basis of dose-volume histograms: Cardiac dose and LADCA (mean and maximum dose, D25% and D45%), dose to ipsilateral and contralateral lung (mean, D20%, D30%), dose to contralateral breast (mean dose), total monitor units, V5% of total body and normal tissue integral dose (NTID). In addition, homogeneity index and conformity index, as well as the excess absolute risk (EAR) to estimate the risk of second malignancy were calculated. RESULTS: T-IMRT showed a significant reduction in mean cardiac dose of 26% (p = 0.002) compared to t-VMAT, as well as a significant reduction in the mean dose to LADCA of 20% (p = 0.03). Following t-IMRT, mean dose to the left lung was increased by 5% (p = 0.006), whereas no significant difference was found in the mean dose to the right lung and contralateral breast between the two procedures. Monitor units were 31% (p = 0.000004) lower for t-IMRT than for t-VMAT. T-IMRT technique significantly reduced normal tissue integral dose (NTID) by 19% (p = 0.000005) and the V5% of total body by 24% (p = 0.0007). In contrast, t-VMAT improved CI and HI by 2% (p = 0.001) and 0.4% (p = 0.00001), respectively. EAR with t-IMRT was significantly lower, especially for contralateral lung and contralateral breast (2-5/10,000 person years) but not for ipsilateral lung. CONCLUSION: Compared to t-VMAT, t-IMRT in left-sided breast irradiation significantly reduced dose to organs at risk as well as normal tissue integral dose, and V5% total body. EAR with t-IMRT was significantly lower for contralateral lung and contralateral breast. T-VMAT, however, achieved better homogeneity and conformity. This may be relevant in individual cases where sufficient coverage of medial lymphatic target volumes is warranted."

If, after analysis in terms of beam on time, integral dose, dose conformity, and organ at risk sparing the treating physician decided that the Edge 5 plan was not suitable for clinical treatment, a plan with TomoEdge and 2.5 cm field width was created (Edge 2.5) and used for the treatment. Among the 45 cases, 30 were suitable for Edge 5 treatment, including treatments of the head and neck, rectal cancer, anal cancer, malignancies of the chest, breast cancer, and palliative treatments. In these cases, the use of a 5 cm field width reduced beam on time by more than 30% without compromising plan quality. The 5 cm beam could not be clinically applied to treatments of the pelvic lymph nodes for prostate cancer and to head and neck irradiations with extensive involvement of the skull, as dose to critical organs at risk such as bladder (average dose 28 Gy vs. 29 Gy, Reg 2.5 vs. Edge 5), small bowel (29% vs. 31%, Reg 2.5 vs. Edge 5) and brain (average dose partial brain 19 Gy vs. 21 Gy, Reg 2.5 vs. Edge 5) increased to a clinically relevant, yet not statistically significant, amount.

This method of irradiation creates uniform dose distribution in the target, minimizing the radiation dose to the lung. However, this method of irradiation results in many cases in which the amount of dose in the irradiated area differs as a result of the shape and size of the breast. It is necessary to prevent excessive doses from reaching the lung. IMRT ensures a uniform dose to the target. Therefore, IMRT was examined because of the possibility that the normal tissue dose can be effectively utilized in cases of conservative radiation therapy of breast cancer by providing a minimum dose. To compare the irradiation of each method of rectangular tangential irradiation, an electronic compensator (ELC), and IMRT, which uses Dynamic MLC, we evaluated target dose uniformity, standard deviation, and target differential DVH in 13 examples. We evaluated the lung dose of the irradiated side (V(30), 30 Gy volume) of the lung to the volume of the lung on the irradiated side based on the report of Hernando.(6)) With this method of irradiation, irrespective of the difference in the shape and size of the target, dose uniformity with ELC was very good. IMRT can reduce the lung dose in comparison with the other irradiation methods. However, it is apt to cause a high-dose area in the irradiation field. In addition, it affects the target and the skin-extracting contour, and the dose to the skin surface declines. Although ELC cannot offer lung doses that are as low as those of IMRT, most of the 13 examples planned for cure with ELC showed rates of 22% of V(30) and below. In conservative radiation therapy of breast cancer, ELC is more effective than the rectangular tangential irradiation method and IMRT."

However, having reviewed the literature, we found no dosimetric constraint for acute skin toxicity that would be applicable to modern RT planning. This study aimed to identify dosimetric factors that are associated with higher rates of acute skin toxicity. A retrospective review was carried out including women who received adjuvant forward-planned intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) after breast-conserving surgery. Acute skin toxicity grade was prospectively recorded. A total of 131 patients were analyzed. On multivariate analysis, the V105% > 30 cc (p = 0.013) and the use of conventional fractionation (CF) (p = 0.001) were statistically significant for acute skin toxicity. On literature review, current quantitative dosimetric parameters that have shown statistical significance include a V107% > 3 cc in hypofractionation (HF), V107% > 9 cc in CF, treated volume 110% > 5.13%, and V107% > 28.6%. There is little evidence on the predictive value of clinically applicable dosimetric factors in acute skin toxicity. Given the recent improvements in RT planning, we would consider a V107% or a V110% too high a dosimetric value to be useful for the majority of patients. We have shown that a V105% of greater than 30 cc is significantly associated with acute skin toxicity, controlling for other variables. We suggest that this is currently the most useful modifiable parameter available to reduce skin toxicity and is applicable to modern RT planning. We also suggest that consideration be given to hypofractionated schedules to further reduce acute skin toxicity."

This study investigated the treatment outcomes of initial clinically IMN-positive breast cancer patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), including IMN irradiation, following primary breast surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of 95 breast cancer patients with clinically detected IMNs at diagnosis treated with surgery and RT between June 2009 and December 2015. Patients received adjuvant RT to the whole breast/chest wall and regional lymph node (axillary, internal mammary, and supraclavicular) areas. Twelve patients received an additional boost to the IMN area. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 43.2 months (range, 4.5 to 100.5 months). Among 77 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 52 (67.5%) showed IMN normalization and 19 (24.6%) showed a partial response to IMN. There were 3 and 24 cases of IMN failure and any recurrence, respectively. The 5-year IMN failure-free survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were 96%, 70%, and 84%, respectively. IMN failure-free survival was significantly affected by resection margin status (97.7% if negative, 87.5% for close or positive margins; p = 0.009). All three patients with IMN failure had initial IMN size >/=1 cm and did not receive IMN boost irradiation. The median age of the three patients was 31 years, and all had hormone receptor-negative tumors. CONCLUSION: RT provides excellent IMN control without the support of IMN surgery. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy, including IMN boost for breast cancer patients, is a safe and effective technique for regional lymph node irradiation."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Clips in the CBCT image are detected automatically using in-house software. The treatment couch is translated according to the shift in the clips' center of mass between the planning and CBCT images. Three components for the PTV margin are considered: (1) breathing, (2) surrogate error (i.e., error in cavity position after perfect setup to clips), and (3) residual error (i.e., error arising from the inability to execute a perfect setup to clips due to technological limitations, such as couch travel precision). These factors were input into a standard formula for CTV-to-PTV margin calculation. RESULTS: The average magnitude of clip-based corrections was 7 +/- 2 mm (10 patients, 44 fractions). After localization, the residual error magnitude was 1.6 +/- 1.3 mm, justifying an isotropic CTV-to-PTV margin of approximately 6 mm, including breathing and surrogate error. CONCLUSIONS: On-line localization of the lumpectomy cavity using surgical clips is technically feasible from the standpoint of equipment, time, and process, making possible a decreased CTV-to-PTV margin for accelerated partial breast irradiation. Because the procedure is exclusively target based, additional monitoring of critical structures may be advisable."

We determined current practice of clip usage in patients referred to a regional centre for radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery. We also investigated whether participation of surgical units in IMRT trials, where tumour bed clip use is emphasised, was associated with clip insertion. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive CT planning images (n = 205), of breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy following breast conserving surgery. Presence and number of clips; referring hospital and referring surgeon of the patient was recorded. This was correlated to previous participation of referring hospital to IMRT trials. RESULTS: Of 196 eligible patients, 126 (64%) had clips sited, of which 15 (12%) had two or fewer clips. Five referring hospitals were high recruiters (>/=14 patients), and five hospitals were low/non-recruiters (</=1 patient) to IMRT trials. Of patients from low/non-recruiting centres, 29 of 43 (67%) had clips omitted, compared to 41 of 153 (27%) from high-recruiting centres (p < 0.001). Median number of clips used in centres recruiting high numbers of patients was four, compared to zero in low recruiting centres. Ten of 31 referring surgeons routinely omitted clips. CONCLUSION: Despite inclusion in national guidelines, clip insertion has not become routine in the UK in patients undergoing breast conserving surgery. However, hospitals involved in breast radiotherapy randomised controlled trials are more compliant with clip usage recommendations. Auditing of clip insertion should be considered as a quality control marker in breast surgery."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 263 women with 268 mammary carcinomas (International Union Against Cancer Stage I-IIB) who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant RT between 1990 and 1994 were included. The potential risk factors for local recurrence-free survival were investigated. RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 94 months, 27 locoregional recurrences, 25 of which were in breast, were diagnosed. The cumulative rate of in-breast recurrence was 4.1% +/- 1.4% at 5 years of follow-up and 9.9% +/- 2.4% at 10 years. The multivariate analysis identified medial tumor location and delayed RT (defined as an interval of >2 months between surgery and the start of RT) as significant risk factors for in-breast recurrence in the overall study population. Medial tumor location vs. lateral/central location (hazard ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-5.84) resulted in a cumulative in-breast recurrence rate of 22.5% +/- 8.3% vs. 6.9% +/- 2.3% at 10 years.

The MammoSite applicator treatment was prescribed to a total dose of 34 Gy. External beam doses generally ranged from 60 to 66 Gy. RESULTS: Based on common toxicity criteria scores for acute toxicities, MammoSite patients experienced less cutaneous toxicity, fatigue, and breast pain and had higher Karnofsky performance status scores during the acute period than external beam patients but experienced more seroma pain during followup. These results were both statistically significant and clinically meaningful. CONCLUSIONS: In our institutional experience, PBI using the MammoSite applicator produces less acute toxicity than external beam radiotherapy of the whole breast but is associated with an increased incidence of seroma pain. The rate of disease recurrence in both cohorts was low."

Japanese women have smaller physiques than American women in general. Thus, we developed external beam plans for APBI using computed tomography (CT) data of Japanese patients, to investigate whether APBI using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy is safely applicable for Japanese women, while verifying the dose distributions. METHODS: We used CT data from six Japanese patients with early breast cancer, which were obtained in routine clinical practice during whole breast irradiation (WBI) after wide excision, and made 32 APBI plans according to the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-39 and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0413 protocol, which compared APBI with WBI. We then investigated the compliance to the dose constraints of the protocol. RESULTS: None of 16 plans for the medial regions met the dose constraints regardless of laterality of the breast. The major reason was overdosage to the contralateral breast. Thirteen of 16 plans (81%) for the lateral regions met the dose constraints. The remaining three plans (19%) did not meet the dose limitation of the uninvolved normal breast, suggesting that a large ratio of the target to the breast was problematic. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese women, patients with a laterally located small tumor can be candidates for APBI using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy."

We compared this IMRT technique with a standard partial wide tangential (PWT) plan and a five-field (5F) photon-electron plan. 10 patients who underwent left-sided mastectomy were planned to 50.4 Gy using either (1) PWT to cover the internal mammary (IM) nodes and supraclavicular fields, (2) 5F comprising standard tangents, supraclavicular fields and an electron field for the IM nodes or (3) IMRT. The planning target volume (PTV) included the left chest wall, supraclavicular, axillary and IM lymph nodes. No beams were directed at the right lung, right breast or heart. Mean dose-volume histograms were constructed by combining the dose-volume histogram data from all 10 patients. The mean PTV to receive 95% of the dose (V95%) was improved with the IMRT plan to 94.2% from 91.4% (p = 0.04) with the PWT plan and from 87.7% (p = 0.012) with the 5F plan. The mean V110% of the PTV was improved to 3.6% for the IMRT plan from 16.8% (p = 0.038) for the PWT plan and from 51.8% (p = 0.001) for the 5F plan.

Immediately after tumor resection the tumor bed can be treated with low-distance X-rays by a single high dose. Whereas often a geographic miss in covering the boost target occurs with external beam boost radiotherapy (EBRT), the purpose of IORT is to cover the tumor bed safely. This report will focus on the feasibility and technical aspects of the Intrabeam device and will summarize our experience with side effects and local control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2002 and June 2003 57 breast cancer patients, all eligible for breast conserving surgery (BCS), were treated at the Mannheim Medical Center with IORT using the mobile X-ray system Intrabeam. The patient population in this feasibility study was not homogeneous consisting of 49 patients with primary stage I or II breast cancer, seven with local recurrence after previous EBRT and one with a second primary in a previously irradiated breast. The selection criteria for referral for IORT included tumor size, tumor cavity size, margin status and absence of an extensive intraductal component. The previously irradiated patients with local recurrences and 16 others received IORT as single modality. In all other cases IORT was followed by EBRT with a total dose of 46 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. The intraoperatively delivered dose after tumor resection was 20 Gy prescribed to the applicator surface. EBRT was delivered with a standard two-tangential-field technique using linear accelerators with 6- or 18-MV photons. Patients were assessed every three months by their radiation oncologist or surgeon during the first year after treatment and every six months thereafter. Breast ultrasound for follow-up was done every six months and mammographies once yearly. Acute side effects were scored according to the CTC/EORTC score and late side effects according to the Lent-Soma classification. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients received IORT only; eight patients because they had received previous radiotherapy, 16 because of a very favorable risk profile or their own preference. Thirty-three patients with tumor sizes between 1 and 30 mm and no risk factors were treated by IORT as a boost followed by EBRT. The Intrabeam system was used for IORT. The Intrabeam source produces 30-50 KV X-rays and the prescribed dose is delivered in an isotropic dose distribution around spherical applicators. Treatment time ranged between 20 and 48 minutes. No severe acute side effects or complications were observed during the first postoperative days or after 12 months. One local recurrence occurred 10 months after surgery plus IORT followed by EBRT. In two patients distant metastases were diagnosed shortly after BCS. DISCUSSION: IORT with the Intrabeam system is a feasible method to deliver a single high radiation dose to breast cancer patients. As a preliminary boost it has the advantage of reducing the EBRT course by 1.5 weeks, and as APBI it might be a promising tool for patients with a low risk of recurrence. The treatment is well tolerated and does not cause greater damage than the expected late reaction in normal tissue."

Modulating doses and schedules has shown little efficacy in improving results. Given the synergistic therapeutic effect reported for combined systemic chemotherapy with local radiation in anal, rectal, and head and neck malignancies, we sought to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of combined capecitabine and radiation for palliation of pain due to bone metastases from breast cancer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-nine women with painful bone metastases from breast cancer were treated with external beam radiation in 10 fractions of 3 Gy, 5 fractions a week for 2 consecutive weeks. Oral capecitabine 700 mg/m(2) twice daily was administered throughout radiation therapy. Rates of complete response, defined as a score of 0 on a 10-point pain scale and no increase in analgesic consumption, were 14% at 1 week, 38% at 2 weeks, 52% at 4 weeks, 52% at 8 weeks, and 48% at 12 weeks. Corresponding rates of partial response, defined as a reduction of at least 2 points in pain score without an increase in analgesics consumption, were 31%, 38%, 28%, 34% and 38%.

Side effects were of mild intensity (grade I or II) and included nausea (38% of patients), weakness (24%), diarrhea (24%), mucositis (10%), and hand and foot syndrome (7%). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: External beam radiation with concurrent capecitabine is safe and tolerable for the treatment of pain from bone metastases of breast cancer origin. The overall and complete response rates in our study are unusually high compared to those reported for radiation alone. Further evaluation of this approach, in a randomized study, is warranted.

The toxicity rates are reported for low-dose-rate (LDR) and high-dose-rate (HDR) APBI on this trial. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The inclusion criteria for this study included invasive nonlobular tumors < or =3 cm after lumpectomy with negative surgical margins and axillary dissection with zero to three positive axillary nodes without extracapsular extension. The patients were treated with either LDR APBI (45 Gy in 3.5-5 days) or HDR APBI (34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions within 5 days). Chemotherapy (> or =2 weeks after APBI) and/or tamoxifen could be given at the discretion of the treating physicians. RESULTS: Between August 1997 and March 2000, 100 women were enrolled in this study, and 99 were evaluated. Of the 99 women, 33 were treated with LDR and 66 with HDR APBI. The median follow-up for all patients was 2.7 years (range, 0.6-4.4 years) and was 2.9 years for LDR and 2.7 years for HDR patients.

Of the 33 patients treated with LDR, 3 (9%) had Grade 3 or 4 toxicity during brachytherapy. Late toxicities included skin thickening, fibrosis, breast tenderness, and telangiectasias. No patient experienced late Grade 4 toxicity; the rate of Grade 3 toxicity was 18% for the LDR and 4% for the HDR groups. CONCLUSION: Acute and late toxicity for this invasive breast radiation technique was modest and acceptable. Patients receiving chemotherapy, a nonprotocol therapy, had a greater rate of Grade 3 toxicity. The study design did not allow for this to be tested statistically."

A case is presented where whole breast irradiation (WBI) was planned after breast conserving surgery in a patient with synchronous bilateral breast cancer. A comparison was made between the feasibility of helical tomotherapy and direct tomotherapy. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old woman was found to have bilateral breast nodules on routine mammographic screening, resulting in bilateral lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Histopathology showed a 6 mm diameter invasive ductal carcinoma in the right breast (Grade 1, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative) and an 8mm diameter tubular carcinoma in the left breast (Grade 1, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative). Lymph node biopsy and histology, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound scan, and bone scintigraphy were negative for metastases (both tumors were Stage 1). Adjuvant therapy with commenced with anastrozole, but no chemotherapy was given. Clinical target volumes (CTVs) were contoured on computed tomography (CT) images. For planning target volumes (PTVs), CTVs were expanded by 1 cm in all directions, except for the medial 5 mm. Since dose constraints to organs at risk (OARs) were beyond established limits, CTVs were expanded by 5 mm. For PTVs, OAR doses and homogeneity indices for helical tomotherapy and direct tomotherapy were compared. Helical tomotherapy provided better target volume coverage and OAR sparing than direct tomotherapy. CONCLUSIONS In a case of bilateral synchronous Stage 1 and Grade 1 breast cancer, helical tomotherapy appeared more suitable than direct tomotherapy."

Ross, G.",2001,Cardiac avoidance in breast radiotherapy: a comparison of simple shielding techniques with intensity-modulated radiotherapy,"Breast Neoplasms/*radiotherapy *Heart/radiation effects Humans Radiation Injuries *Radiation Protection Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted *Radiotherapy, Conformal Tomography, X-Ray Computed",0,522,eng,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adjuvant breast radiotherapy (RT) is now part of the routine care of patients with early breast cancer. However, analysis of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative suggests that patients with the lowest risk of dying of breast cancer are at significant risk of cardiac mortality due to longer relapse-free survival. Patients with a significant amount of heart in the high-dose volume have been shown to be at risk of fatal cardiac events. This study was designed to assess whether conformal planning or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques allow reduced cardiac irradiation whilst maintaining full target coverage. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten patients with early breast cancer were available for computed tomography (CT) planning. Each had at least 1 cm maximum heart depth within the posterior border of conventional tangents. For each patient, plans were generated and compared using dose volume histograms for planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk. The plans included conventional tangents with and without shielding. The shielding was designed to either completely spare the heart or to shield as much heart as possible without compromising PTV coverage. IMRT plans were also prepared using two- and four-field tangential and six-field arc-like beam arrangements. RESULTS: PTV homogeneity was better for the tangential IMRT techniques. For all patients, cardiac irradiation was reduced by the addition of partial cardiac shielding to conventional tangents, without compromise of PTV coverage. The two- and four-field IMRT techniques also reduced heart doses. The average percentage volume of heart receiving >60% of the prescription dose was 4.4% (range 1.0-7.1%) for conventional tangents, 1.5% (0.2-3.9%) for partial shielding, 2.3% (0.5-4.6%) for the two-field IMRT technique and 2.2% (0.4-5.6%) for the four-field IMRT technique. For patients with larger maximum heart depths the four-field IMRT plan achieved greater heart sparing than the partial shielding, although irradiation of the contralateral breast was increased. Full cardiac shielding resulted in the most complete heart sparing but with compromise of the PTV coverage; the mean volume receiving less than 95% of the prescription dose was 4% (range 1.5-8.7%). CONCLUSION: All patients undergoing adjuvant tangential breast RT in whom the heart is seen to be in the high-dose volume should be considered for the addition of cardiac-sparing lead blocks. Three-dimensional CT planning and alternative beam arrangements with IMRT optimization enables more complete cardiac sparing without compromise of PTV coverage in certain patients."

Twenty left breast cancer patients treated with WBRT after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) were enrolled in this study. Remnant breast tissue, 3 levels of the axilla, heart, and lung were delineated. We used 2 different radiotherapy methods: 3D-CRT with field-in-field technique and 7-field fixed-beam IMRT. The target coverage of IMRT was significantly better than that of 3D-CRT (Dmean: 49.72 +/- 0.64 Gy vs 50.24 +/- 0.66 Gy, P < 0.001; V45: 93.19 +/- 1.40% vs 98.59 +/- 0.30%, P < 0.001; V47.5: 86.43 +/- 2.72% vs 95.00 +/- 0.02%, P < 0.001, for 3D-CRT and IMRT, respectively). In the IMRT plan, a lower dose was delivered to a wider region of the heart and lung. Significantly lower axillary irradiation was shown throughout each level of axilla by IMRT compared to 3D-CRT (Dmean for level I: 42.58 +/- 5.31 Gy vs 14.49 +/- 6.91 Gy, P < 0.001; Dmean for level II: 26.25 +/- 10.43 Gy vs 3.41 +/- 3.11 Gy, P < 0.001; Dmean for level III: 6.26 +/- 4.69 Gy vs 1.16 +/- 0.51 Gy, P < 0.001; Dmean for total axilla: 33.9 +/- 6.89 Gy vs 9.96 +/- 5.21 Gy, P < 0.001, for 3D-CRT and IMRT, respectively). In conclusion, the incidental dose delivered to the axilla was significantly lower for IMRT compared to 3D-CRT. Therefore, IMRT, which only includes the breast parenchyma, should be cautiously used in patients with limited positive sentinel lymph nodes and who do not undergo complete axillary lymph node dissection."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients consented to an institutional review board approved protocol of accelerated partial breast intensity-modulated radiotherapy with fiducial marker placement and treatment with IGRT. Patients (1 patient with bilateral breast cancer; 20 total breasts) underwent ultrasound guided implantation of three 1.2- x 3-mm gold markers placed around the surgical cavity. For each patient, table shifts (inferior/superior, right/left lateral, and anterior/posterior) and minimum, maximum, mean error with standard deviation were recorded for each of the 10 BID treatments. The dose contribution of daily orthogonal films was also examined. RESULTS: All IGRT patients underwent successful marker placement. In all, 200 IGRT treatment sessions were performed. The average vector displacement was 4 mm (range, 2-7 mm). The average superior/inferior shift was 2 mm (range, 0-5 mm), the average lateral shift was 2 mm (range, 1-4 mm), and the average anterior/posterior shift was 3 mm (range, 1 5 mm). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the use of IGRT can be successfully used in an accelerated partial breast intensity-modulated radiotherapy protocol. The authors believe that this technique has increased daily treatment accuracy and permitted reduction in the margin added to the clinical target volume to form the planning target volume."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four patients with previous elective subpectoral breast augmentation were enrolled on this APBIMRT trial. These four patients were treated with 10 equal twice daily 3.85 Gy fractions over 5 consecutive days (total dose of 38.5 Gy) using APBIMRT and IGRT. Patients were assessed for pain and cosmetic outcome (physician and a patient self-assessment). RESULTS: At last follow-up, two patients reported an excellent cosmetic results (at 2 years and at 8 months, respectively), one reported good cosmetic results (at 2 years), and one reported poor cosmetic results (at 20 months). Physicians rated the cosmetic outcomes as excellent in two (CEL; at 2 years and 8 months, respectively), good in one (CEL; at 20 months) and excellent in one (KTH; at 2 years).

Calculations of equivalent uniform dose (EUD) were performed to identify the appropriate APBI dose for this technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: APBI plans were developed for 15 patients: five with three-dimensional conformal APBI (3D-CRT), five with multi-lumen intracavitary balloons (m-IBB), and five simulating NIBB treatment. Prescription doses of 34.0 and 38.5 Gy were delivered in 10 fractions for m-IBB and 3D-CRT, respectively. Prescription doses ranging from 34.0 to 38.5 Gy were considered for NIBB. Dose-volume histogram data from all 3D-CRT, m-IBB, and NIBB plans were used to calculate the biologically effective EUD and corresponding EUD to the PTV_eval using the following equation: EUD = EUBED/(n [1 + EUD/alpha/beta]). An alpha/beta value of 4.6 Gy was assumed for breast tumor. EUD for varying NIBB prescription doses were compared with EUD values for the other APBI techniques. RESULTS: Mean PTV_eval volume was largest for 3D-CRT (372.9 cm(3)) and was similar for NIBB and m-IBB (88.7 and 87.2 cm(3), respectively). The EUD value obtained by prescribing 38.5 Gy with 3D-CRT APBI was 38.6 Gy. The EUD value of 34.0 Gy prescribed with m-IBB was 34.4 Gy. EUD values for NIBB ranged from 33.9 to 38.2 Gy for prescription doses ranging from 34.0 to 38.5 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Using EUD calculations to compare APBI techniques and treatment doses, a prescription dose of 36.0 Gy in 10 fractions using NIBB has a comparable biologic equivalent dose to other established brachytherapy techniques."

METHODS: In the HALFMOON technique, the CTV consisted of skin, subcutaneous tissues, and pectoralis major muscle, excluding the implant, chest wall muscles, and rib plane. The HALFMOON plans were compared with conventionally contoured CTV plans, in which the whole implant, chest wall muscles, and ribs plane were included in the CTV, in a ratio 1:3. All patients underwent hypofractionated treatment of 40.05 Gy/15 fractions, using helical Tomotherapy((R)). RESULTS: Eighteen patients undergoing HALFMOON technique were compared to 54 subjects treated with conventionally contoured CTV plans. No difference was found in the planning target volume coverage between the two groups. Conversely, a statistically relevant dose reduction in HALFMOON patients was observed for ipsilateral lung (D15%, p < 0.0001; D20%, p < 0.0001; D35%, p = 0.003), contralateral lung (D20%, p = 0.048), contralateral breast (D15%, p = 0.031; D20%, p = 0.047), and stomach (Dmean, p = 0.011). Regarding the implant, V90% and D50% decreased by 46% and 8%, respectively, in the HALFMOON plans (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The HALFMOON approach is technically feasible and resulted in high-dose conformity of the target with a significant reduction of radiation dose delivered to implant and other organs. A clinical study is needed to assess the impact on reconstruction cosmetic outcome and local control."

The present work attempts a dosimetric comparison between this treatment modality and conventional whole breast external beam radiotherapy by looking at differences in risk organ exposure to radiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The planning CT data sets of 16 consecutive patients with left-sided breast cancer who received external beam radiotherapy to the whole breast followed by a boost to the tumour bed using multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy after breast conserving surgery were used to create two independent physical treatment plans - one for an external radiotherapy, one for sole partial breast brachytherapy in each case assuming a total reference dose of 50Gy for each patient. Dose-volume parameters D(0.1cc), D(0.5cc), D(1cc,)D(2cc), D(5cc,)D(10cc), D(25cc), D(50cc), V(100), V(90), V(50), V(10), V(5) for the ipsilateral lung, the heart and the adjacent skin were calculated and compared between the two treatment modalities. RESULTS: All organs at risk showed a substantially lower radiation exposure in the brachytherapy plan. This was most pronounced for the heart with values differing by a factor of four. Although somewhat less marked this was also true for the ipsilateral lung and the adjacent skin with exposure ratios of three and two, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With the use of multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy substantial reductions in the radiation exposure of risk organs can be achieved in comparison to whole breast external beam radiotherapy. These are likely to translate into profound clinical benefits."

RESULTS: Between 02/2014 and 04/2016, 10 patients received palliative local irradiation of 15 isolated lesions. Most patients (90%) had received one or more prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease. The median duration of exposure to durvalumab was 5.2 months with a median delivery of 11 cycles (range, 4-38 cycles). RT (conformal 3D RT, 79% and intracranial stereotactic RT, 21%) was delivered at a median biologically-effective dose of 28 Gy (range, 6-92), in a median number of five fractions (range, 1-10) and over a median duration of 6 d (range, 1-14). Five patients (50%) reported an irradiation-related adverse event (AE) grade (G) 1 or 2 and one patient had two G2 AEs. The most frequently reported AE (3/6) was G2 mucositis. There was no G3 or more RT-related AEs. All AEs were transient, lasted less than one week, and were manageable by standard guidelines. There was no unexpected AE. On 10/15 in-field (IF) evaluable lesions, the objective response (OR) rate was 60% (complete response, 2/10 and partial response, 4/10) and 4/10 stable disease (SD). All evaluated IF lesions had a TGR decrease resulting in a significant decrease in the TGR between the two periods (before versus after RT; p < 0.01). Outfields disease evaluation retrieved 10/14 SD and 4/14 progressive disease (PD). There was no out-field OR, no abscopal effect and no out-field difference between the two periods according to TGR (p = 0.09).

METHODS: Each of the selected patient who had received breast conserving surgery was immobilized and received the primary CT simulation assisted by ABC device to get five sets of CT images in three different breathing status, including free breathing (FB) (one set), moderate deep inspiration breathing hold (mDIBH)(two sets) and deep expiration breathing hold (DEBH) (2 sets). After 10 to 15 fractions of radiation, the repeated CT simulation was completed and the same five sets of CT images were obtained at FB, mDIBH, and DEBH, respectively. In the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system, the forward IMRT planning was completed on the first set of mDIBH CT images from the primary CT simulation, and the planning was separately copied by the special system order to the second set of CT images from the primary CT simulation and to the first set of CT images from the repeated CT simulation, keeping the primary angle, direction, size and shape of the MLC field and prescribed dose un-changed. the volumes covered by selected high dose area in the selected segment were compared. RESULTS: In the planning based on the first set of mDIBH CT images from the primary CT simulation, the volume irradiated by equal and more than 103% of prescribed dose in the segment was (1.16 +/- 0.39) cm3, and the volumes were (3.88 +/- 1.07) cm3 and (51.66 +/- 8.68) cm3 in the plannings copied from the first set of mDIBH CT images from the primary CT simulation respectively to the second set of CT images from the primary CT simulation and first set of CT images from the repeat CT simulation, the difference of the volume in the two plannings based on the two set mDIBH CT image from the primary CT simulation was not statistically significant (t = -1.672, P = 0.103). The difference of the volume in the two plannings based on the two sets of mDIBH CT images respectively from the primary and repeat CT simulations had a significant difference (t = -5.728, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: If the same threshold of mDIBH is maintained during IMRT after breast conserving surgery, the influence of the intrafraction target displacement on the dose distribution is not significant. However, if set-up error is not adjusted, the interfraction change of position of the segment given to cover the high dose area in the IMRT planning will be significant, resulting in a significant change of dose distribution in the breast."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electron beam with appropriate energy was combined with four intensity modulated photon beams. The direction of the electron beam was chosen to be tilted 10-20 degrees laterally from the anteroposterior direction. Two of the intensity-modulated photon beams had the same gantry angles as the conventional tangential fields, whereas the other two beams were rotated 15-25 degrees toward the anteroposterior directions from the first two photon beams. An iterative algorithm was developed which optimizes the weight of the electron beam as well as the fluence profiles of the photon beams for a given patient. Two breast cancer patients with early-stage breast tumors were planned with the new technique and the results were compared with those from 3D planning using tangential fields as well as 9-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques. RESULTS: The combined electron and IMRT plans showed better dose conformity to the target with significantly reduced dose to the ipsilateral lung and, in the case of the left-breast patient, reduced dose to the heart, than the tangential field plans. In both the right-sided and left-sided breast plans, the dose to other normal structures was similar to that from conventional plans and was much smaller than that from the 9-field IMRT plans. The optimized electron beam provided between 70 to 80% of the prescribed dose at the depth of maximum dose of the electron beam. CONCLUSIONS: The combined electron and IMRT technique showed improvement over the conventional treatment technique using tangential fields with reduced dose to the ipsilateral lung and the heart. The customized beam directions of the four IMRT fields also kept the dose to other critical structures to a minimum."

Inverse planning of IMRT was employed at a prescribed dose of 34 Gy/10 f/5 d. Acute radiation skin responses and clinical effects were observed. RESULTS: All of them completed radiation. During the radiation, Grade 1 of acute radiation skin reaction (mild hyperpigmentation) was seen in 8 patients and there was not > grade 2 of skin reaction.

At Month 3 post-radiation, all instances of acute radiation skin reactions recovered. The median follow-up period was 51 months (range: 35 - 59). The follow-up period of 23 patients were over 3 years. No local recurrences developed. The 3-year disease-free survival was 100%. Cosmesis was good or excellent in all cases at Year 2. CONCLUSION: External beam-partial breast irradiation delivered by IMRT is feasible for selected Chinese early-stage breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery.

Percentage changes of whole breast tissue volume receiving more than 100%, 80%, 50%, and 20% of the prescription dose for TMAT relative to IMRT were -10.81% +/- 6.91%, -27.81% +/- 7.39%, -14.82% +/- 9.67%, and 39.40% +/- 10.53% (P</=.01). CONCLUSIONS: This is a first demonstration of end-to-end planning and delivery implementation of a fully dynamic APBI TMAT. Compared with IMRT, TMAT resulted in marked reduction of the breast tissue volume irradiated at high doses."

A total of nine Chinese women who received breast conservation treatment were included in this study. Target localization and movement (range of motion) during normal respiration were assessed using ultrasound and 4DCT. Plans based on 3DCT and 4DCT scans were developed in accordance to RTOG0319 guidelines and dose delivery comparisons were made between these plans. The mean ranges of motion of the excision cavity volume as determined using 4DCT were 1.03 +/- 0.51, 2.08 +/- 0.92, and 1.27 +/- 0.58 mm in the right-left, anterior-posterior, and superior-interior directions, respectively. There were no significant differences between the mean and maximum PTV-E doses or the volume receiving 95% of the prescribed dose (V95). 4D plan prescribed dose levels were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than 3D plan levels for all of the following: ipsilateral breast V100, ipsilateral lung V30, and contralateral lung V5. Maximum contralateral breast and thyroid doses were also significantly lower with the 4D plan (p < 0.05). This study highlights the usefulness of 4DCT for the planning of 3DCRT in breast cancer patients. Our findings suggest that the use of 4DCT can lead to improvements in target definition and decreases in normal tissues irradiation."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty breast cancer patients with breast-conserving surgery treated by helical tomotherapy have been studied. The median age was 49 (min: 25, max: 69). The whole breast, tumour bed and lymph nodes were prescribed 52.2 Gy, 63.8 Gy and 50.4 Gy, all in 29 fractions. The dose per fraction was 2.2 Gy to the boost, 1.8 Gy to the breast and 1.74 Gy to the lymph node volumes. The reproducibility was analysed by recording the daily shifts in x, y and z directions and roll rotation. All toxicities were described using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects v3.0. RESULTS: Twenty-two tumours were irradiated. Six-eight percent were located in the inner quadrant. In 90 % of patients supraclavicular and internal mammary nodes were treated. The coverage of planning target volumes (PTV) was as follows: PTV boost: V107 = 0.3 % +/- 0.5 SD, V95 = 98.4 % +/- 1.9 SD; PTV breast: -V107 = 7.8 % +/- 17.3 SD, V95 = 96.8 % +/- 2.2 SD; PTV LN: V107 = 2.5 % +/- 4.2 SD, V95 = 92.7 % +/- 13.2 SD. The mean V20 of the homolateral lung was 18.9 % +/- 3.5 SD. For left side lesion, the mean V30 of the heart was 0.9 % +/- 0.8 SD. The mean V5 was: V5 homolateral lung: 73.1 % +/- 11.8 ET, controlateral lung: 38.9 % +/- 21, heart (left side breast): 57.3 % +/- 21, controlateral breast: 15.5 % +/- 9.6. Median shifts were as follow: x-axis -0.04 mm (IC 95: -0.4 +0.38), y-axis -0.37 mm +/- 5.51 (IC 95: -0.88 +0.14), z-axis 2.90 mm +/- 5.42 (IC 95:+2.4+3.4) and roll rotation 0.22 +/- 1.10 (IC 95: -0.1+0.32). The treatment tolerance was acceptable with 1 definitive interruption couple of fractions before the end and 3 temporal interruptions for skin toxicity. No grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Ninety-five percent of patients experienced skin toxicity: 45 % grade 2. There were 3 cases of oesophagitis. The median follow-up of presented series is 9.7 months and all of the patients are free of disease without any residual early or late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Helical tomotherapy can achieve full target coverage while protected to the heart and ipsilateral lung. This treatment was well tolerated and reproducible. However, the low doses to normal tissue volumes need to be reduced in future studies."

A novel 125I source emitting radiation in a specified direction has been developed. The directional sources contain an internal radiation shield that greatly reduces the intensity of radiation in the shielded direction. The sources have a similar dose distribution to conventional nondirectional sources on the unshielded side. The treatment plan for a patient treated with HDR interstitial brachytherapy with 192Ir (iridium) was compared with a directional 125I treatment plan using the same data set. Several dosimetric parameters are compared including target volume coverage, volume receiving 50%, 100%, and 150% of the prescription dose (V50, V100, and V150, respectively), dose homogeneity index (DHI), and the skin surface areas receiving 30%, 50%, and 80% of the prescription dose (S30, S50, and S80, respectively). The HDR and LDR prescription doses were 34 Gy in ten fractions delivered over five days and 45 Gy in 108 h, respectively. Similar and excellent target volume coverage was achieved by both directional LDR and HDR plans (99.2% and 97.5%, respectively). For a 170 cm3 target volume, the dosimetric parameters were similar for LDR and HDR: DHI was 0.82 in both cases, V100 was 214.4 cm3 and 225.7 cm3, and V150 was 39.1 cm3 and 40.4 cm3, respectively. However, with directional LDR, significant reductions in skin dose were achieved: S30 was reduced from 100.6 to 62.5 cm2, S50 from 50.6 to 16.1 cm2, and S80 from 2 cm2 to zero. The reduction in V50 for the whole breast was more than 100 cm3 (386.1 cm3 for LDR versus 489.2 cm3 for HDR). In this case study, compared with HDR, directional interstitial LDR 125I sources allow similar dose coverage to the subcutaneous target volume while lowering the skin dose due to a more conformal dose distribution and quicker falloff beyond the target. The improved dose distribution provided by directional interstitial brachytherapy might enable partial breast treatment to tumors closer to the skin or chest wall or in relatively small breasts."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten women with early stage left-sided breast cancer were treated with breast conserving surgery and radiation. Whole breast radiation was delivered for actual treatment via a tangential technique with deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) utilizing inverse planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Each patient was replanned on an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved prospective study using en face proton beam radiation with both uniform scanning (US) and pencil beam scanning (PBS) techniques. RESULTS: Both PBS (0.011 Gy) and US (0.009 Gy) proton plans resulted in a significantly lower mean heart dose compared to IMRT (1.612 Gy) (p < 0.05 for PBS vs. IMRT and US vs. IMRT). The Dmean, Dmin, Dmax, and D0.2cm(3) of the LAD with either proton technique were significantly lower (p = 0.005) compared to IMRT. Both US and PBS reduced the mean dose to the lungs compared to IMRT. The coverage of the breast planning target volume was comparable between photon and proton plans. CONCLUSIONS: The dose to whole heart was relatively low in this study of patients treated under conditions of DIBH. However, proton beam radiation was associated with lower minimum, maximum, and dose to 0.2 cm(3) of the LAD, which is the critical structure for late radiation therapy effects, compared to even the most optimized photon beam plan with DIBH and IMRT."

A dosimetric comparison of IMRT and CR was evaluated in 20 patients with early-stage breast cancer using a three-dimensional treatment planning system. The prescribed mammary gland dose was completed in 25 fractions with a total dose of 5,000 cGy. Homogeneity of the planning target volume (PTV), irradiation dose and volume of organs at risk (OARs) were evaluated through a dose-volume histogram. For the homogeneity of PTV, the average volume receiving 95% of the prescribed dose in the IMRT plan was similar to that in the CR plan (97 vs. 96%, respectively). With regard to normal tissue sparing in OARs, the ipsilateral lung V20 in the IMRT and CR plans was 27.8 and 20.8%, respectively. The mean dose and V30 of the heart for five patients were 598.4 versus 348.3 cGy and 10.06 versus 5.3%, respectively. The mean dose sparing the heart or lung was markedly reduced in the IMRT plan compared with the CR plan. The results of the current study demonstrated that whole breast IMRT improves PTV dose distribution and improves normal tissue sparing in OARs."

Understanding physician-level variation and behavior patterns can inform such interventions. Objective: To assess patterns of physician ordering of services that tend to be overused in the treatment of patients with cancer. We hypothesized that physicians exhibit consistent behavior. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective study of patients 66 years and older diagnosed with cancer between 2004 and 2011, using population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data to assess physician-level variation in 5 nonrecommended services. Services included imaging for staging and surveillance in low-risk disease, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) after breast-conserving surgery, and extended fractionation schemes for palliation of bone metastases. Main Outcome and Measures: To assess variation in service use between physicians, we used a random effects model and a logistic regression model with a lag variable to assess whether a physician's use of a service for a prior patient predicts subsequent service use. Results: Cohorts ranged from 3464 to 89006 patients. The total proportion of patients receiving each service varied from 14% for imaging in staging early breast cancer to 41% in early prostate cancer. From the random effects analysis, we found significant unexplained variation in service use between physicians (P < .001 for each service; ICC, 0.04-0.59). Controlling for case mix, whether a physician ordered a service for the prior patient was highly predictive of service use, with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) ranging from 1.12 (95% CI, 1.07-1.18) for surveillance imaging for patients with breast cancer (28% service use if prior patient had imaging vs 25% if not), to 24.91 (95% CI, 22.86-27.15) for IMRT for whole breast radiotherapy (69% vs 7%, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Physicians' utilization of nonrecommended services that tend to be overused exhibit patterns that suggest consistent behavior more than personalized patient care decisions. Reducing overuse may require understanding cognitive drivers of repetitive inappropriate decisions."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 2093 patients were treated between 2000 and 2008. 10 Gy boost was prescribed in case of FMS>5mm; 16 Gy boost with FMS between 2 and 5mm; 20 Gy boost in case of FMS<2mm or positive. RESULTS: After a median follow up of 5.2 years, we recorded 41 local relapse (LR, 2%). Concerning LR free survival, age at diagnosis, nuclear grade, hormonal status, T-stage, adjuvant hormonal therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy emerged as significant parameters (p-values from log rank test <0.05). FMS, that directed the RT boost dose, did not have significant impact on LRFS (p=0.46). LR rates were 2.3% for FMS<2mm, 2.6% for 2-5mm FMS and 1.8% for FMS>5mm. At multivariate analysis, higher nuclear grade (p=0.045), triple negative subtype (p=0.036) and higher T-stage (p=0.02) resulted as the independent predictors of LR occurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience showed that a margin-directed policy of RT boost dose-escalation seems to reduce the negative impact of FMS on LR, but it is not able to overcome the unfavorable effect of higher nuclear grade, higher T stage and triple negative subtype."

A survival benefit after breast conservation, however, has only been proven recently which was in part due to excessive cardiac mortality of patients who had been treated with radiotherapy in the past. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The literature on postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer was reviewed with regard to cardiac toxicity as the basis for hypothesis generation. RESULTS: From numerous publications on cardiac toxicity of breast cancer radiotherapy, the following pattern emerges: in series where a high radiation dose was applied to a significant percentage of the heart (postmastectomy and postlumpectomy series) cardiac toxicity/mortality was increased versus a nonexposed cohort or for left over right disease. If, however, a relevant exposure of cardiac muscle could be more or less excluded based on the technique used (mainly more recent postlumpectomy radiotherapy), no cardiac toxicity was observed. Series for which individual dose exposure varied or could not be clarified also came to varying conclusions. Also due to retrospectively unclear dose distributions, an exact quantification of tolerance doses/effects of different geographic dose distribution patterns could not be performed to date. A particularly difficult question to answer is the threshold volume for clinically relevant cardiotoxicity with tangential radiotherapy at prescription doses. As a consequence, this precludes an estimate in which situations multifield intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with its characteristic dose distribution pattern of a larger volume exposed to intermediate doses and higher mean/median heart doses (as shown in Figure 1) might be preferable. CONCLUSION: This review updates the database on cardiac toxicity of breast cancer radiotherapy with special emphasis regarding the issues related to the clinical use of IMRT. Multifield IMRT may reduce the cardiac risk for a small subset of patients at excessive risk with conventional tangential radiotherapy due to unfavorable thoracic geometry, for whom partial-breast radiotherapy is not an option. Due to further concern about the effects of intermediate doses to larger heart volumes, potentially increased contralateral cancer risk and the long latency of clinically apparent toxicity, the introduction of breast IMRT should be closely followed. Accompanying functional studies may have the potential to detect cardiac toxicity at an earlier time."

The plans of six patients were reproduced in an Alderson phantom. Measurements were performed in the planning target volume (PTV), contralateral breast, lungs, heart, thyroid gland and in mid-pelvis. RESULTS: Dose distribution in the PTV was nearly identical for WT and ST with the exception of D(1). Scattered doses were significantly smaller for ST. In the contralateral breast the doses per 2-Gy fraction were 7.3 cGy +/- 2.1 cGy (WT), and 4.7 cGy +/- 1.9 cGy (ST; p < 0.01). Similar doses were measured for lung and heart. In mid pelvis the largest difference was observed (WT: 1.0 cGy +/- 0.2 cGy, ST: 0.2 cGy +/- 0.1 cGy; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Partial volume segments can replace wedges for improved dose coverage and homogeneity in the PTV. The ST causes significantly less scattered dose to extra-target organs.

For each patient an additional IMRT treatment plan was created using the same CT data and contours as used in MIBT plans. OAR-s included ipsilateral non-target and contralateral breast, lung of both sides, skin, ribs and heart for left sided lesions. The CTV was created from the outlined lumpectomy cavity with a total margin (surgical+radiation) of 20mm in six main directions. The PTV in IMRT plans was generated from CTV with an addition of isotropic 5mm margin. The prescribed dose was 30.1Gy with 7x4.3Gy fractionation for both techniques.

RESULTS: Except for high dose, non-target breast received less dose with MIBT. V90 was 3.6% vs. 4.8% and V50 was 13.7% vs. 25.5% for MIBT and IMRT, respectively. Ipsilateral lung was spared better with MIBT. Mean lung dose was 5.1% vs. 7.1%, [Formula: see text] was 39.0% vs. 54.3% and V5 was 32.9% vs. 41.7% in favour of MIBT.

Ribs received less dose with MIBT with values of 45.6% vs. 69.3% for [Formula: see text] and 1.4% vs. 4.2cm(3) for V50. Dose to contralateral breast and lung was low with both techniques. No significant differences were observed in maximal doses, but dose to volumes of 0.1cm(3) and 1cm(3) were less with MIBT for both organs. [Formula: see text] was 3.2% vs. 6.7% for breast and 3.7% vs. 5.6% for lung with MIBT and IMRT, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The target volume can be appropriately irradiated by both techniques, but MIBT generally spares normal tissues and organs at risk better than IMRT. Except for the heart, other critical structures receive less doses with brachytherapy. To observe whether these dosimetric findings translate into clinical outcome more studies are needed with assessment of toxicity profiles."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed both single institutional and randomized studies involving single-fraction IOERT treatments. Rates for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences, disease-specific survival, and overall survival were obtained. RESULTS: IOERT had true 5-year recurrence rates of > 1.5% for ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) and ESTRO (European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology) suitable women, or for low-risk women as defined by the ELIOT trial. Women with ductal carcinoma in situ eligible for breast-conserving therapy, older women that currently receive no EBRT, and younger women with favorable biology are additional potential candidates. CONCLUSION: ASTRO suitable and ESTRO good women for accelerated partial breast irradiation are low-risk groups. Higher-risk women with favorable biology might also be suitable candidates for IOERT, providing the tumor biology can be determined prior to surgery. For intraoperative radiotherapy using 50-kV X-rays, follow-up was too short to assess the effectiveness of the treatment."

Late normal tissue complications induced by radiotherapy must be avoided with new breast radiotherapy techniques being developed. The aim of the study was to compare dosimetric parameters of planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk between conformal (CRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) after breast-conserving surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 20 patients with early stage left breast cancer received adjuvant radiotherapy after conservative surgery, 10 by 3D-CRT and 10 by IMRT, with a dose of 50 Gy in 25 sessions. Plans were compared according to dose-volume histogram analyses in terms of PTV homogeneity and conformity indices as well as organs at risk dose and volume parameters. RESULTS: The HI and CI of PTV showed no difference between 3D-CRT and IMRT, V95 gave 9.8% coverage for 3D-CRT versus 99% for IMRT, V107 volumes were recorded 11% and 1.3%, respectively. Tangential beam IMRT increased volume of ipsilateral lung V5 average of 90%, ipsilateral V20 lung volume was 13%, 19% with IMRT and 3D-CRT respectively. Patients treated with IMRT, heart volume encompassed by 60% isodose (30 Gy) reduced by average 42% (4% versus 7% with 3D-CRT), mean heart dose by average 35% (495 cGy versus 1400 cGy with 3D-CRT). In IMRT minimal heart dose average is 356 cGy versus 90 cGy in 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT reduces irradiated volumes of heart and ipsilateral lung in high-dose areas but increases irradiated volumes in low-dose areas in breast cancer patients treated on the left side."

However, multiple options exist beyond standard fractionated whole breast irradiation including hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HFRT), accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), and endocrine therapy (ET) alone, which can limit treatment duration, and potentially reduce morbidity and cost. Limited data are available on the percentage of patients eligible for these alternatives; therefore, a Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) analysis was performed to assess candidacy for these alternative options in women with early stage breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women treated for breast cancer between the years of 2010 and 2012 were identified in the SEER database. Patients with unknown staging, metastatic disease, T3/T4 disease, and >/=N1 disease were excluded. Patients were defined as eligible for HFRT based on the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) consensus guidelines and randomised trial testing intensity modulated and partial organ radiotherapy following breast conservation surgery for early breast cancer (IMPORT LOW) trial criteria, APBI based on the ASTRO, American Brachytherapy Society and the Groupe Europeen de Curietherapie of European Society for Therapeutic Radiotherapy and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) consensus guidelines, and GEC-ESTRO APBI and IMPORT LOW trial criteria, and ET alone based on the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9343 and Post-operative Radiotherapy in Minimum Risk Elderly II inclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 108,484 women with early stage breast cancer who met the aforementioned inclusion criteria were identified. Of these patients, 86,896 (80.1%) were eligible for HFRT based on ASTRO consensus guidelines and 81,459 (75.0%) based on IMPORT LOW trial criteria. Regarding APBI, 44,797 (41.2%), 81,020 (74.6%), 81,020 (74.6%) were eligible according to ASTRO, ABS, GEC-ESTRO consensus guidelines, respectively, 97,301 (89.7%) patients according to the GEC-ESTRO trial criteria, and 81,459 (75.0%) patients according to the IMPORT LOW trial criteria. For ET alone, 23,006 (21.2%) were eligible according to Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9343 criteria and 42,104 (38.8%) according to Post-operative Radiotherapy in Minimum Risk Elderly II criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This SEER analysis demonstrates that a substantial proportion of women with early stage breast cancer are eligible for HFRT, APBI, or ET alone after breast conserving surgery according to consensus guidelines and prospective trial criteria. With incorporation of additional pathologic, dosimetric, and chemotherapy data, quality assurance pathways may use such data to help ensure patients are receiving appropriate risk stratified treatment recommendations."

METHODS: Patients with early stage breast cancer for whom adjuvant radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery was planned were consecutively enrolled. Five sessions of simulation with the Active Breathing Coordinator were planned for each patient. Computed tomography for simulation was not acquired until a good level of compliance with the procedure was achieved by the patient. Patients who did not show a satisfactory level of compliance after the planned fifth session were defined as noncompliant. Two simulation computed tomography scans were acquired: the first without the Active Breathing Coordinator during free breathing, the second with the Active Breathing Coordinator. Forward intensity-modulated treatment plans were calculated. Mean lung dose (MLDipsilateral) and V30 (V30lung) for the ipsilateral lung and V30 for the heart (V30heart), were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients were enrolled (6 with left-sided breast cancer and 14 with right-sided breast cancer). Eighteen of the patients completed the simulation computed tomography with the Active Breathing Coordinator after 1-5 sessions (median, 3). In 16 of the 18 patients, a reduction of V301ung was observed with the Active Breathing Coordinator. In 15 of the 18 patients, a reduction of MLDipsiateral was also observed. In 5 of the 6 patients with left-sided breast cancer, a reduction of V30heart was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Routine application of the Active Breathing Coordinator in clinical practice is feasible, even though it requires an increased workload. Dosimetric results are encouraging in terms of a better sparing of the ipsilateral lung and the heart."

Conventionally, irradiation is carried out with the aid of tangentially arranged fields. However, more modern and more complex radiation techniques such as IMRT (intensity-modulated radio therapy) are used more frequently, as they improve dose conformity and homogeneity and, in some cases, achieve better protection of adjacent risk factors. The use of this technique has implications for the incidental- and thus unintended- irradiation of adjacent loco regional lymph drainage in axillary lymph node levels I-III and internal mammary lymph nodes (IMLNs). A comparison of a homogeneous real-life"" patient collective, treated with helical tomotherapy (TT), patients treated with 3D conformal RT conventional tangentially arranged fields (3DCRT) and deep inspiration breath hold (3DCRT-DIBH), was conducted. MATERIALS/METHODS: This study included 90 treatment plans after BCS, irradiated in our clinic from January 2012 to August 2016 with TT (n = 30) and 3D-CRT (n = 30), 3DCRT DIBH (n = 30). PTVs were contoured at different time points by different radiation oncologists (> 7). TT was performed with a total dose of 50.4 Gy and a single dose of 1.8 Gy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to the tumor cavity (TT group). Patients irradiated with 3DCRT/3DCRT DIBH received 50 Gy a 2 Gy and a sequential boost. Contouring of lymph drainage routes was performed retrospectively according to RTOG guidelines. RESULTS: Average doses (DMean) in axillary lymph node Level I/Level II/Level III were 31.6 Gy/8.43 Gy/2.38 Gy for TT, 24.0 Gy/11.2 Gy/3.97 Gy for 3DCRT and 24.7 Gy/13.3 Gy/5.59 Gy for 3DCRT-DIBH patients. Internal mammary lymph nodes (IMLNs) Dmean were 27.8 Gy (TT), 13.5 Gy (3DCRT), and 18.7 Gy (3DCRT-DIBH). Comparing TT to 3DCRT-DIBH dose varied significantly in all axillary lymph node levels and the IMLNs. Comparing TT to 3DCRT significant dose difference in Level I and IMLNs was observed. CONCLUSION: Dose applied to locoregional lymph drainage pathways varies comparing tomotherapy plans to conventional tangentially arranged fields. Studies are warranted whether dose variations influence loco-regional spread and must have implications for target volume definition guidelines."""

The technique accurately targets breast tissue and the tumor bed and reduces dose inhomogeneity in the target. By decreasing excess dose to the skin and lung, a concomitant boost to the tumor bed can be delivered during the initial treatment, thereby decreasing the overall treatment time by one week. More than 120 breast cancer patients have been treated with this breast conservation technique in our clinic. For each patient, a 3D treatment plan based upon breast and tumor bed volumes delineated on computed tomography (CT) was developed. Segmented tangent fields were iteratively created to reduce hot spots"" produced by traditional tangents. The tumor bed received a concomitant boost with additional conformal photon beams. The final tumor bed boost was delivered either with conformal photon beams or conventional electron beams. All patients received 45 Gy to the breast target, plus an additional 5 Gy to the surgical excision site, bringing the total dose to 50 Gy to the boost target volume in 25 fractions. The final boost to the excision site brought the total target dose to 60 Gy. With minimum follow-up of 4 months and median follow-up of 11 months, all patients have excellent cosmetic results. There has been minimal breast edema and minimal skin changes. There have been no local relapses to date. Forward planning of multi-segment fields is facilitated with 3D planning and multileaf collimation. The treatment technique offers improvement in target dose homogeneity and the ability to confidently concomitantly boost the excision site. The technique also offers the advantage for physics and therapy staff to develop familiarity with multiple segment fields, as a precursor to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques."""

We report capsular contracture following partial implant irradiation from hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for lung cancer in a 64 year-old female with augmentation mammaplasty. METHODS: The patient had biopsy-proven, T1 non-small cell lung carcinoma, adjacent to the implant. She received 50 Gy in 4 fractions to 91% of planning target volume using a 7-field, 3D-conformal plan with 6 MV photons and daily CT-guided target localization. The implant received 9.3 Gy mean dose, 51.7 Gy maximum point dose, with V10 41%, V20 15% and V30 4%. RESULTS: At seven months, the patient reported left breast pain requiring narcotic analgesics and demonstrated modified Baker/Palmer grade 4 capsular contracture. Breast retraction assessment measurement increased from baseline 10.4 mm to 19.8 mm. CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first reported case of capsular contracture from partial breast implant radiation following SBRT for lung cancer. Further investigation to elucidate maximum tolerated dose of radiation given to breast implants in this setting is needed."

Recently, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) has been proposed for well-selected patients. A cost and cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out comparing WBI with two APBI techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An activity-based costing method was used to determine the treatment cost from a societal perspective of WBI, high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR) and permanent breast seed implants (PBSI). A Markov model comparing the three techniques was developed with downstream costs, utilities and probabilities adapted from the literature. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for a wide range of variables, including treatment costs, patient costs, utilities and probability of developing recurrences. RESULTS: Overall, HDR was the most expensive ($14 400), followed by PBSI ($8700), with WBI proving the least expensive ($6200). The least costly method to the health care system was WBI, whereas PBSI and HDR were less costly for the patient. Under cost-effectiveness analyses, downstream costs added about $10 000 to the total societal cost of the treatment. As the outcomes are very similar between techniques, WBI dominated under cost-effectiveness analyses. CONCLUSIONS: WBI was found to be the most cost-effective radiotherapy technique for early breast cancer. However, both APBI techniques were less costly to the patient. Although innovation may increase costs for the health care system it can provide cost savings for the patient in addition to convenience."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hypothetical 3-cm lumpectomy sites were contoured in each quadrant of a left breast by using dosimetric guidelines from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-39/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0413 protocol. Coplanar intensity-modulated topotherapy treatment plans were optimized by using two-, three-, four-, five-, and seven-field arrangements for delivery by the tomotherapy unit with fixed gantry angles. Optimized noncoplanar five-field 3D-CRT and IMRT were compared with corresponding topotherapy plans. RESULTS: On average, 99.5% +/- 0.5% of the target received 100% of the prescribed dose for all topotherapy plans. Average equivalent uniform doses ranged from 1.20-2.06, 0.79-1.76, and 0.10-0.29 Gy for heart, ipsilateral lung, and contralateral lung, respectively. Average volume of normal breast exceeding 90% of the prescription and average area of skin exceeding 35 Gy were lowest for five-field plans. Average uniformity indexes for five-field plans using 3D-CRT, IMRT, and topotherapy were 1.047, 1.050, and 1.040, respectively. Dose-volume histograms and calculated equivalent uniform doses of all three techniques illustrate clinically equivalent doses to ipsilateral breast, lung, and heart. CONCLUSIONS: This dosimetric evaluation for a single patient shows that coplanar partial breast topotherapy provides good target coverage with exceptionally low dose to organs at risk. Use of more than five fields provided no additional dosimetric advantage. A comparison of five-field topotherapy to 3D-CRT and IMRT for accelerated partial breast irradiation illustrates equivalent target conformality and uniformity."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: At our Institute, we have been treating the index quadrant with external intensity-modulated radiation therapy in a phase III trial. For this study, we selected a sample of 10 patients with right- or left-sided breast cancer and surgical clips at the excision site. Contouring of the target was performed both using three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) and 4DCT imaging. On both 3DCT and 4DCT, we recorded the clinical target volume (CTV) and the planning target volume (PTV) and the coordinates of the PTV centroid. We calculated the treatment plans, according to our protocol, using the contours drawn on the 3DCT and 4DCT and evaluated target coverage and sparing of organs at risk (OAR). RESULTS: Median age of the patients was 63.5 years (range 52-75). The comparison between the 3DCT and 4DCT PTV volumes was not statistically significant (p = 0.79). Concerning centroid coordinates, the average absolute differences were 0.1 mm in the latero-lateral, 0.7 mm in the antero-posterior and 0.3 mm in the supero-inferior direction. No statistically significant differences were observed both in PTV coverage and OAR sparing; the 4D PTV contour is adequately covered when the plan based on the 3D contours is used. Target coverage was reduced on average by 1 % and no statistically significant difference was observed (p = 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, no significant differences between PTV volumes, PTV coverage, OAR sparing and centroid position are evidenced when comparing 3DCT and 4DCT plans. Conventional 3DCT-based planning is adequate for aPBI."

The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive summary of the literature relating to the magnitude of motion during radiation therapy for a breast cancer patient. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Medline, Cinhal, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science. Studies included were limited to women having radical radiation therapy to the whole breast in the supine position. Studies needed to report quantitatively on the magnitude of inter- and intra-fraction motion using electronic portal imaging, port films or kilovoltage imaging techniques. Eighteen articles fitted the selection criteria. The averages of random and systematic error for inter- and intra-fraction movement were reported using central lung distance, central irradiated width, central beam edge to skin distance and cranio-caudal distance measurements, or isocentric matching techniques. Inter-fraction motion was consistently larger than intra-fraction motion but, on average, within a 5 mm tolerance. There were, though, large maximum inter- and intra-fraction variations observed in the measurements of individual patients, which indicate the need for daily inter- and intra- fraction motion management before implementing IMRT, VMAT, tomotherapy or PBI techniques."

The Conformity Index (CI), the Homogeneity Index (HI), the dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters for the organs at risk and the delivery efficiency were evaluated. RESULTS: The VMAT plans showed on average higher CI of PTV (0.77 +/- 0.03) than both sIMRT (0.68 +/- 0.02) and 3D-CRT (0.55 +/- 0.04) plans (P< 0.05). The HI values in the VMAT, sIMRT and 3D-CRT plans were 0.10 +/- 0.01 0.09 +/- 0.01 and 0.13 +/- 0.01 (P> 0.05), respectively, and the differences among the three techniques were not statistically significant. In the ipsilateral lung, the VMAT plans showed lower Dmean, V30, V20, and V10 than the sIMRT and 3D-CRT (P< 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in V5. In the heart, the VMAT plans had lower V30 and V20 than the sIMRT and 3D-CRT plans (P< 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the Dmean and V5. In the contralateral lung, the VMAT plans showed higher Dmean and V5 than sIMRT and 3D-CRT (P< 0.05). In the contralateral breast, the VMAT plans had a higher V5 than the sIMRT and 3D-CRT plans (P< 0.05). The VMAT plans had higher MU's than sIMRT and 3D-CRT, while the treatment times were lower than that of sIMRT. CONCLUSION: For left-sided breast cancer radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, the VMAT plans had a better CI than the sIMRT and 3D-CRT plans. The VMAT and the sIMRT plans had better HI than the 3D-CRT plans, but no significant difference was observed between VMAT and sIMRT."

Patients with a single lesion (n= 10), multiple lesions (n = 10) or a single lesion close to organs at risk (n = 5) and previously treated with DCA were selected. For each patient, the DCA treatment was replanned with all VMAT techniques. All DCA plans were compared with VMAT plans and evaluated in regard to the different quality indices and dosimetric parameters. For single lesion, homogeneity index (HI) better results were found for the RANC technique (0.17 +/- 0.05) compared with DCA procedure (0.27+/- 0.05). Concerning conformity index (CI), the RAT technique gave higher and better values (0.85 +/- 0.04) compared with those obtained with the DCA technique (0.77 +/- 0.05). DCA improved healthy brain protection (8.35 +/- 5.61 cc vs. 10.52 +/- 6.40 cc for RANC) and reduced monitor unit numbers (3046 +/- 374 MU vs. 4651 +/- 736 for RANC), even if global room occupation was higher. For multiple lesions, VMAT techniques provided better HI (0.16) than DCA (0.24 +/- 0.07). The CI was improved with RAT (0.8 +/- 0.08 for RAT vs. 0.71 +/- 0.08 for DCA). The V10Gy healthy brain was better protected with DCA (9.27 +/- 4.57 cc). Regarding the MU numbers: RANC < RAT< RAC < DCA. For a single lesion close to OAR, RAT achieved high degrees of homogeneity (0.27 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.2 for DCA) and conformity (0.72+/- 0.06vs. 0.56 +/- 0.13 for DCA) while sparing organs at risk (Dmax = 12.36 +/- 1.05Gyvs. 14.12 +/- 0.59 Gy for DCA, and Dmean = 3.96 +/- 3.57Gyvs. 4.72 +/- 3.28Gy for DCA). On the other hand, MU numbers were lower with DCA (2254 +/- 190 MUvs. 3438 +/- 457 MU for RANC) even if overall time was inferior with RAC. For a single lesion, DCA provide better plan considering low doses to healthy brain even if quality indexes are better for the others techniques. For multiple lesions, RANC seems to be the best compromise, due to the ability to deliver a good conformity and homogeneity plan while sparing healthy brain tissue. For a single lesion close to organs at risk, RAT is the most appropriate technique."

Though still debatable, tumor cavity boost is routinely practised in our centre. Hypofractionation is not yet the current standard of practice in Asian countries. Employing hypofractionation and simultaneous integrated boost to lumpectomy cavity with conformal technique is not the current practice in this region. Hence the study was performed to see whether accelerated hypofractionation and simultaneous boost can be combined using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in treating early breast cancer (EBC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Female patients with EBC treated by whole breast radiation and boost were treated simultaneously to a dose of 40.5Gy and 48Gy in fifteen fractions over three weeks to entire breast and tumor cavity respectively with VMAT. Dosimetry including target coverage, OAR (organ at risk) sparing and acute radiation toxicity were evaluated. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients were treated. Planning target volume (PTV) coverage and OAR sparing were mostly satisfactory. Mean volume of PTVWB and PTVBoost were 786.18cm(3) and 228.9cm(3) respectively. Mean Dmean to PTVWB and PTVBOOST were 41.9Gy and 49.1Gy respectively. Dmax to PTVWB and PTVBOOST were 127.56% and 110.67% respectively. Ipsilateral lung mean dose and V20 were 13.92Gy and 21.53% respectively. V40 and V25 of heart were 0.17% and 2.25% respectively. All patients are disease free after a median follow up of two years. Most acute toxicities were Grade1. Only two patients out of ten developed Grade 2 skin reaction during radiation. Early cosmesis using Harvard cosmesis scale is good to excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated hypofractionated RT using SIB-VMAT is a clinically feasible technique with acceptable initial result. Initial results are encouraging. MINI ABSTRACT: Simultaneous integrated boost with accelerated hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy is a novel approach. Patient selection and technical considerations are of paramount importance. The present study describes successful implementation of this approach."

One hundred and ninety seven had complete records and films available for review. Ninety-seven (49%) were treated with APBI (MammoSite) and 100(51%) were treated with external beam. Image findings for APBI versus external beam were: distortion 90(93%) versus 83(83%), seroma 67(69%) versus 7(7%), skin edema 52(54%) versus 47(47%), increased stroma 75(77%) versus 66(66%), calcifications 10(10%) versus 6(6%), and fat necrosis 12(12%) versus 6(6%). For APBI, skin and stromal edema was more commonly focal. At imaging, the seroma rate was statistically and significantly different between the two treatment modes (p < 0.0001). For patients treated with APBI, seroma formation was not related to balloon size and only weakly related to lumpectomy cavity size. The complication rate was significantly higher for those treated with APBI (36 versus 20%) and the types and treatment of complications differed. There were three recurrences among the APBI group and none among those treated with external beam radiation."

The purpose of our study is to compare the dosimetry of four different external beam APBI (EB-APBI) plans: three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), helical tomotherapy (TOMO), and proton beam therapy (PBT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients were included in the study, and plans for four techniques were developed for each patient. A total dose of 30Gy in 6Gy fractions once daily was prescribed in all treatment plans. RESULTS: In the analysis of the non-PTV breast volume that was delivered 50% of the prescribed dose (PD), PBT (mean: 16.5%) was superior to TOMO (mean: 22.8%), IMRT (mean: 33.3%), and 3D-CRT (mean: 40.9%) (p<0.001). The average ipsilateral lung volume percentage receiving 20% of the PD was significantly lower in PBT (0.4%) and IMRT (2.3%) compared with 3D-CRT (6.0%) and TOMO (14.2%) (p<0.001). The average heart volume percentage receiving 20% and 10% of the PD in left-sided breast cancer (N=19) was significantly larger with TOMO (8.0%, 19.4%) compared to 3D-CRT (1.5%, 3.1%), IMRT (1.2%, 4.0%), and PBT (0%, 0%) (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: All four EB-APBI techniques showed acceptable coverage of the PTV. However, effective non-PTV breast sparing was achieved at the cost of considerable dose exposure to the lung and heart in TOMO."

We made comparative analysis of two kinds of radiotherapy that can achieve improved dose homogeneity. First is a MSF that uses both major and small irradiation fields at the same time. The other is IMRT using 3 or 5 beams with an inverse planning system using multiple static multileaf collimators. We made treatment plans for 16 early left breast cancer patients who were randomly selected and had undergone breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy, and analyzed them in the dosimetric aspect. For the mean values of V(95) and dose homogeneity index, no statistically significant difference was observed among the three therapies. Extreme hot spots receiving >110% of prescribed dose were not found in any of the three methods. Using Tukey's test, IMRT showed a significantly larger increase in exposure dose to the ipsilateral lung and the heart than MSF in the low-dose area, but in the high-dose area, MSF showed a slight increase. To improve dose homogeneity, the application of MSF, which can be easily planned and applied more widely, is considered optimal as an alternative to IMRT for radiotherapy of early left breast cancer."

The effectiveness of CHI was validated by assessing the treatment plans for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC, 12 cases), breast cancer after breast-conserving-surgery (BC, 10 cases), and stereotactic radiosurgery after whole brain irradiation (SRS, 9 cases). Our results indicate that both CHI and HI of the target can distinguish Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) from Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT, p < 0.05) while the mean differences in CHI (NPC 1.16, BC 1.19 and SRS 3.3) were larger than those in HI (NPC 0.03, BC 0.02 and SRS 0.02). In addition, CHI of the combination volume (the target minus the boost) were statistically higher in VMAT than IMRT in all three kinds of cancer.

Firstly, closing the defect by suturing the cavity walls together and secondly leaving the tumour bed open thus allowing seroma fluid to collect. There is debate regarding which technique is preferable, as it has been reported that a post-operative seroma increase post-operative infection rates and late normal tissue side effects. METHODS: Data from 648 patients who participated in the Cambridge Breast IMRT trial were used. Seromas were identified on axial CT images at the time of radiotherapy planning and graded as not visible/subtle or easily visible. An association was sought between the presence of seroma and the development of post-operative infection, post-operative haematoma and 2 and 5 years normal tissue toxicity (assessed using serial photographs, clinical assessment and self assessment questionnaire). RESULTS: The presence of easily visible seroma was associated with increased risk of post-operative infection (OR = 1.80; p = 0.004) and post-operative haematoma (OR = 2.1; p = 0.02). Breast seroma was an independent risk factor for whole breast induration and tumour bed induration at 2 and 5 years. The presence of breast seroma was also associated with inferior overall cosmesis at 5 years. There was no significant association between the presence of seroma and the development of either breast shrinkage or breast pain. CONCLUSION: The presence of seroma at the time of radiotherapy planning is associated with increased rates of post-operative infection and haematoma. It is also an independent risk factor for late normal tissue toxicity. This study suggests that full thickness surgical closure may be desirable for patients undergoing breast conservation and radiotherapy."

We estimate NTCP parameters for breast fibrosis after external beam radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We pooled individual patient data of 5856 patients from 2 trials including whole breast irradiation followed with or without a boost. A two-compartment dose volume histogram model was used with boost volume as the first compartment and the remaining breast volume as second compartment. Results from START-pilot trial (n=1410) were used to test the predicted models. RESULTS: 26.8% patients in the Cambridge trial (5 years) and 20.7% patients in the EORTC trial (10 years) developed moderate-severe breast fibrosis. The best fit NTCP parameters were BEUD3(50)=136.4 Gy, gamma50=0.9 and n=0.011 for the Niemierko model and BEUD3(50)=132 Gy, m=0.35 and n=0.012 for the Lyman Kutcher Burman model. The observed rates of fibrosis in the START-pilot trial agreed well with the predicted rates. CONCLUSIONS: This large multi-centre pooled study suggests that the effect of volume parameter is small and the maximum RT dose is the most important parameter to influence breast fibrosis. A small value of volume parameter 'n' does not fit with the hypothesis that breast tissue is a parallel organ. However, this may reflect limitations in our current scoring system of fibrosis."

The aim of the study was to determine if 2D planning could be an appropriate treatment in a subgroup of breast cancer patients based on their breast size. Twenty consecutive patients who underwent breast conservation were planned for radiotherapy. The patients were grouped in 3 different categories based on their respective chest wall separation (CWS) and the thickness of breast, as small,"" ""medium,"" and ""large."" Two more contours were taken at locations 5 cm superior and 5 cm inferior to the isocenter plane. Maximum dose recorded at specified points was compared in superior/inferior slices as compared to the central slice. The mean difference for small breast size was 1.93 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.08). For medium breas size, the mean difference was 2.98 (SD = 2.40). For the large breasts, the mean difference was 4.28 (SD = 2.69). Based on our dosimetric study, breast planning only on the single isocentric contour is an appropriate technique for patients with small breasts. However, for large- and medium-size breasts, CT-based planning and 3D planning have a definite role. These results can be especially useful for rationalizing treatment in busy oncology centers."""

The study aimed to analyze partial tangential arc VMAT treatment planning and delivery, including analyzing the cardiac and contralateral breast doses resulting from this technique. A total of 153 consecutively treated breast cancer (conservation as well as mastectomy) patients were taken for this dosimetric study. All patients were planned using partial arc VMAT in the Monaco treatment planning system using two partial arc beams. All patients were divided into seven different categories: (1) all the patients in the study, (2) left sided whole breast and chest wall patients, (3) left Chest wall patients, (4) left whole breast patients, (5) right sided whole breast and chest wall patients, (6) right chest wall patients, and (7) right whole breast patients. We evaluated each treatment plan for PTV coverage and doses to OARs. SPSS version 16.0 software was used for statistical analysis. There were 91 left sided and 62 right sided breast cancer patients in the overall analysis. The percentage of PTV volume receiving 95% of the prescription dose (PTV V95%, mean +/- SD) varied in the range of 91.2 +/- 5.2-94.8 +/- 2.1% with mean dose of 92.4 +/- 5.2% for all cases. The (mean +/- SD) cardiac dose for all the patients was 289 +/- 23 cGy. The (mean +/- SD) cardiac doses were higher for left sided patients (424 +/- 33.8 cGy) as compared to right sided patients (123.9 +/- 80 cGy) (p < 0.001). Cardiac mean doses were higher with arc angles >30 degrees versus 30 degrees (324.5 +/- 247.1 vs. 234.4 +/- 188.4 cGy) (p = 0.001). Similarly contralateral breast mean dose was higher with arc angles >30 degrees versus 30 degrees (126 +/- 115 vs. 88.6 +/- 76.1 cGy) (p = 0.001). However cardiac V20, V30 and V40 Gy did not exhibit any statistical difference between the two groups (p = 0.26, 0.057 and 0.054 respectively). This is the first large study of its kind that assesses the dosimetric outcome of tangential partial arc VMAT treatments in a large group of mastectomy and breast conservation patients. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of this technique in dose coverage of PTV as well as in minimizing dose to OARs. Further, based on our results, we conclude that the arc length for the bi-tangential arcs should be 30 degrees since it helps to achieve the most optimal balance between target coverage and acceptable OAR doses."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were 20 breast cancer patients previously treated with photon-only APBI as part of a clinical trial to a dose of 38.5Gy/10 fractions in 5 days. Mixed-modality replans were compared with the photon-only plans with regards to planning target volume (PTV) coverage, conformity, homogeneity, and doses to normal tissues. RESULTS: The mixed-modality plans had similar PTV coverage, with more conformality, and reduced the volume of the ipsilateral breast receiving > or =95% and > or =50% doses, but had the pitfalls of less homogeneity and increased exposure of the ipsilateral lung and heart receiving low-dose radiation because of the exit dose of the electron beam. Factors associated with this increase were medial/deep-seated tumor beds, large tumor beds with PTV/Ipsilateral Breast ratio >20%, and use of high energy electrons. CONCLUSIONS: The three-field electron/minitangent photon APBI technique was more conformal and reduced the dose to the ipsilateral breast but had the disadvantage of exposing increased volumes of heart and ipsilateral lung to low-dose radiation compared with the photon-only technique."

Between August 2011 and January 2015, 152 patients were treated using two-beam TD-IMRT with 50 Gy/25 fractions. Among them, 20 patients with left-sided breast cancer were randomly chosen, and two-beam TD-IMRT, TD-3DCRT and 3DCRT plans were created for each patient. The homogeneity and conformity indices and various dose-volume parameters for the planning target volume and OARs were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at 3 years. Toxicities were evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. TD-IMRT and TD-3DCRT showed better whole-breast coverage than 3DCRT (P < 0.001). Most of the mean values of dosimetric endpoints for OARs were better in TD-IMRT than in TD-3DCRT and 3DCRT. Overall survival rates were 97.7% and local control rates were 99.1% at 3 years. Regional control and distant metastasis control rates at 3 years were 98.6% and 96.8%, respectively. Twenty-four of the 152 patients had Grade 2 or higher acute radiation dermatitis. Four patients (4/146 = 2.7%) had Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis. There were no late adverse events of Grade 2 or higher. Two-beam TD-IMRT appeared to yield better dose distribution for whole-breast external-beam radiation therapy than TD-3DCRT and two-beam 3DCRT. The treatment appeared to provide low skin toxicity and acceptable tumor control."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective trial testing the feasibility of preoperative APBI followed by lumpectomy for patients with early-stage invasive ductal breast cancer. Eligible patients had T1-T2 (<3 cm), N0 tumors. Patients received 38.5 Gy in 3.85-Gy fractions delivered twice daily. Surgery was performed >21 days after radiation therapy. Adjuvant therapy was given as per standard of care. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients completed treatment. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 0.5-5 years), there have been no local or regional failures. A complete pathologic response according to hematoxylin and eosin stains was seen in 4 patients (15%). There were 4 grade 3 seromas. Patient-reported cosmetic outcome was rated as good to excellent in 79% of patients after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy-APBI is feasible and well tolerated in select patients with early-stage breast cancer, with no reported local recurrences and good to excellent cosmetic results. The pathologic response rates associated with this nonablative APBI dose regimen are particularly encouraging and support further exploration of this paradigm."

We hypothesized that a planning tumor volume (PTV) generation based on an expansion of the pre-lumpectomy (pre-LPC) intact tumor volume would result in smaller volumes of irradiated normal breast tissue compared with using a PTV based on the post-lumpectomy cavity (post-LPC). Use of PTVs based on the pre-LPC might also result in greater patient eligibility for APBI-3D-CRT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-one early-stage breast cancers were analyzed. Preoperative imaging was used to determine a pre-LPC tumor volume. PTVs were developed in the pre- and post-LPC settings as per National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)-B39 guidelines. The pre- and post-LPC PTV volumes were compared and eligibility for APBI-3D-CRT determined using NSABP-B39 criteria. RESULTS: The post-LPC PTV exceeded the pre-LPC PTV in all cases. The median volume for the pre- and post-LPC PTVs were 93 cm(3) (range, 24-570 cm(3)) and 250 cm(3) (range, 45-879 cm(3)), respectively, p <0.001. The difference between pre- and post-LPC PTVs represented a median of 165 cc (range, 21-482 cc) or 16% (range, 3%-42%) of the whole breast volume. Three of 41 vs. 13 of 41 cases were ineligible for APBI-3D-CRT when using the pre- and post-LPC PTVs, respectively. CONCLUSION: PTVs based on pre-LPC tumor expansion are likely associated with reduced amounts of irradiated normal breast tissue compared with post-LPC PTVs, possibly leading to greater patient eligibility for APBI-3D-CRT. These findings support future investigation as to the feasibility of neoadjuvant APBI-3D-CRT."

Administration of APBI-3D-CRT in the preoperative (preop) setting has been shown to decrease the planning target volume. The impact of this decrease on patient eligibility for APBI has not been evaluated in a comparative manner. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients with 41 previously treated breast cancers (</=4 cm) were analyzed. A spherical preop tumor volume was created using the largest reported radiographic dimension and centered within the contoured lumpectomy cavity. Plans were created and optimized using the preop tumor volume and postoperative lumpectomy cavity using NSABP B-39 guidelines. The primary end point was to evaluate for differences in patient eligibility and normal tissue exposure. RESULTS: Thirty-five tumors (85%) in the preop versus 19 tumors (46%) in the postoperative setting were eligible for 3D-CRT-APBI using NSABP B-39 criteria (P=0.0002). The most common reason for ineligibility was due to >60% of the ipsilateral breast volume receiving 50% of the dose. Other reasons included dose to the contralateral breast, heart, and ipsilateral lung. Preop 3D-CRT-APBI was associated with statistically significant improvements in dose sparing to the heart, ipsilateral normal breast tissue, contralateral breast, chest wall, ipsilateral lung, and skin. CONCLUSIONS: Dosimetrically, the use of preop radiation would increase patient eligibility for 3D-CRT-APBI and decrease dose to normal tissues, which will potentially decrease toxicity and improve cosmesis. These results provide the basis for a recently activated prospective study of preop 3D-CRT-APBI."

All patients had previously been treated with full-dose adjuvant external-beam irradiation (EBRT). Disease-free interval after salvage treatment, local tumor control and side effects were analyzed retrospectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1996 and 2002, a total of 32 consecutive patients were treated. 13 patients initially treated with mastectomy and postoperative irradiation and 19 patients initially treated with breast-conserving surgery and postoperative irradiation developed a local recurrence. The mean dose of previous radiation therapy was 58 Gy (range, 42-64 Gy), applied by conventional fractionation. After implantation +/- surgery of recurrent disease and CT-based 3-D planning, 15 patients were irradiated with HDR-IMBT (intensity-modulated brachytherapy) with a mean dose of 28 Gy (range, 10-30 Gy, 2 x 2.5 Gy/day at 6-h daily interfraction interval) and 17 patients received PDR-IMBT with a mean dose 30 Gy (range, 10-45 Gy, 5 x 1 Gy/day at 2-h pulse intervals). Four patients underwent additional EBRT using a dose of 24-40 Gy electrons. Treatment was performed only on working days. RESULTS: After a mean post-implant follow-up of 19 months (range, 1-83 months), no signs of local recurrence were observed in 20 of the 32 patients. In twelve patients, local recurrence occurred after a mean follow-up of 13 months (range, 1-78 months). 20 of the 32 patients experienced an additional systemic progress. In one patient, an EORTC/RTOG grade 3 side effect (ulceration of the skin) was described, which was followed by a local recurrence 12 months posttherapeutically. CONCLUSION: Perioperative interstitial HDR/PDR-IMBT of localized breast or thoracic wall recurrences following previous full-dose EBRT appears to be a meaningful salvage treatment with acceptable toxicity."

But not only external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) treatment is an established method for treatment of breast cancer, also brachytherapy (BT) is an approved method. BT is well known for boost irradiation in combination with EBRT, but new indications as re-irradiation for local recurrences or partial breast irradiation offer new aspects in the field of BT for breast cancer treatment. Because of modern CT based 3-D treatment planning systems and the possibility of intensity modulated brachytherapy (IMBT) has getting more potential. In the future for selected patient's re-irradiation of the breast using IMBT after local relapse and second breast conserving surgery might be an alternative instead of mastectomy. Even partial breast BT following breast conservative operation as a new treatment option is getting more and more interesting and is widely investigated in several studies. Due to the approved techniques and the new indications BT is and will be an attractive alternative and extension in the field of breast cancer treatment. But we need five better ten years results for definite conclusions at least."

W.",2018,Choosing wisely after publication of level I evidence in breast cancer radiotherapy,Calgb Uk start breast cancer choosing wisely hypofractionation omission,0,620,eng,"Background: Recent trials in early-stage breast cancer support hypofractionated whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) as part of breast-conserving therapy (BCT). Evidence also suggests that radiotherapy (RT) omission may be reasonable for some patients over 70 years. Among radiation-delivery techniques, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is more expensive than 3-dimensional conformal RT (3DCRT). Based on this evidence, in 2013, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) recommended hypofractionated schedules for women aged >/=50 years with early-stage breast cancer and avoiding routine use of IMRT for WBRT. To assess response to level I evidence and adherence to ASTRO recommendations, we evaluated the pattern of RT use for early-stage breast cancer at our National Comprehensive Cancer Network institution from 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013 and compared the results with national trends. Methods: Data from a prospective database were extracted to include patients treated with BCT, aged >/=50 years, with histologic findings of invasive ductal carcinoma, stage T1-T2N0M0, estrogen receptor-positive, and HER2 normal. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and estimated costs based on 2016 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (technical fees) and Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (professional fees). Results: Among 55 cases from 2006 to 2008, treatment regimens were 11% hypofractionated, 69% traditional schedule, and 20% RT omission (29% of patients were aged >70 years). Among 83 cases from 2011 to 2013, treatment regimens were 54% hypofractionated, 19% traditional schedule, and 27% RT omission (48% of patients were aged >70 years). 3DCRT was used for all WBRT treatments. Direct medical cost estimates were as follows: 15 fractions 3DCRT, $7,197.87; 15 fractions IMRT, $11,232.33; 25 fractions 3DCRT, $9,731.39; and 25 fractions IMRT, $16,877.45. Conclusion: Despite apparent resistance to shorter radiation schedules in the United States, we demonstrate that rapid practice change in response to level I evidence is feasible. Wider adoption of evidence-based guidelines in early-stage breast cancer may substantially lower health care costs and improve convenience for patients without sacrificing oncologic outcomes."

Proton therapy (PT) can reduce OAR doses compared with conventional photon RT. However, access to PT is currently limited, so referrals must be appropriately selective. We aimed to identify subgroups of patients with HL who could benefit the most dosimetrically from RT with PT based on the prechemotherapy disease characteristics. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Normal tissue radiation doses were calculated for 21 patients with HL who were treated with deep-inspiration breath-hold pencil-beam scanning (PBS) PT and compared with doses from 3-dimensional conformal (3D-CRT) and partial arc volumetric modulated (PartArc) photon RT. Prechemotherapy disease characteristics associated with significant dosimetric benefits from PBS compared with photon RT were identified. RESULTS: Treatment with PBS was well tolerated and provided with good local control. PBS provided dosimetric advantages for patients whose clinical treatment volume extended below the seventh thoracic level and for female patients with axillary disease. In addition, an increasing dosimetric benefit for some OARs was observed for increasing target volume. PBS significantly reduced the mean dose to the heart, breast, lungs, spinal cord, and esophagus. Dose homogeneity and conformity within the target volume were also superior with PBS, but some high-dose measures and hot spots were increased with PBS compared with partial arc volumetric modulated photon RT. CONCLUSIONS: PBS gives good target coverage and local control while providing reductions in radiation dose to OARs for individuals who receive RT for HL compared with advanced photon RT. Our findings highlight groups of patients who would be expected to gain more dosimetric benefit from PBS. These findings facilitate the selection of patients who should be considered a priority for PT."

Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an investigational approach to post-lumpectomy radiation for early breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to compare four external beam APBI techniques, including tomotherapy, with conventional whole breast irradiation for their radiation conformity index, dose homogeneity index, and dose to organs at risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Small-field tangents, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy and helical tomotherapy were compared for each of 15 patients (7 right, 8 left). One radiation conformity and two dose homogeneity indices were used to evaluate the dose to the target. The mean dose to organs at risk was also evaluated. RESULTS: All proposed APBI techniques improved the conformity index significantly over whole breast tangents while maintaining dose homogeneity and without a significant increase in dose to organs at risk. CONCLUSION: The four-field IMRT plan produced the best dosimetric results; however this technique would require appropriate respiratory motion management. An alternative would be to use a four-field conformal technique that is less sensitive to the effects of respiratory motion."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and postoperative whole breast radiotherapy were enrolled. Three plans were generated: a standard tangential plan with either one outer field wedge or bilateral wedges, and an FIF plan. Three indices were used: the dose homogeneity index (DHI), PTV dose improvement index (PDI(index)) and geometric conformity index (g). Also ipsilateral lung, heart and contralateral breast doses were compared for each plan. RESULTS: Dose homogeneity index was significantly lower for the FIF (0.117 +/- 0.021) than for the single wedge (0.131 +/- 0.025, p = 0.02) and double wedged plan (0.128 +/- 0.025, p = 0.04), respectively. The g was significantly less in the FIF (0.70 +/- 0.14) compared to the wedge plans (0.80 +/- 0.17, p = 0.02 and 0.83 +/- 0.16, p = 0.003). Contralateral breast doses were significantly lower in the FIF plan. The FIF plan significantly lowered MU compared to both the single wedge and bilateral wedge plans. CONCLUSION: The dose distribution within the target was more homogenous, and the doses for healthy tissue were less in the FIF plan compared to the tangential wedge plans."

METHODS: Vero4DRT enables DWA by continuous gantry rotation and O-ring skewing with movement of the multi-leaf collimator. We compared the dose distributions of DWA, nc3D-CRT and tVMAT in 24 consecutive left-sided breast cancer patients treated with APBI (38.5Gy in 10 fractions). The average doses and volumes to the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk, especially heart and left anterior descending artery (LAD) were compared among DWA, nc3D-CRT and tVMAT. RESULTS: The doses and volumes to the PTVs did not differ significantly among the three plans. For the DWA plans, the mean dose to the heart was 0.2+/-0.1Gy, less than those of the nc3D-CRT and tVMAT plans. The D2% values of the planning organ at risk volume of the LAD were 9.3+/-10.9%, 28.2+/-31.9% and 20.3+/-25.7% for DWA, nc3D-CRT and tVMAT, respectively. The V20Gy and V10Gy of the ipsilateral lung for the DWA plans were also significantly lower. CONCLUSIONS: DWA allowed to find a better compromise for OAR which overlapped with the PTV.

METHODS: Eight patients with left breast carcinoma who received breast-conservation surgery were selected for this study. Two plans were designed in 3-dimensional treatment planning system. The dose distributions of target volume and normal tissues, conformal index (CI) and heterogeneous index (HI) were analyzed by dose-volume histogram (DVH). RESULTS: The PTV coverage was the same in the two radiotherapy plans. A better dose uniformity throughout the whole breast in Hybrid IMRT plan was achieved. The CI, the percentage of PTV receiving more than 105% prescribed dose (V105%), the percentage of PTV receiving more than 110% prescribed dose (V110%), and the Dmax, Dmin and Dmean of PTV were similar in the two plans. We compared the Hybrid IMRT with IMRT: V13 of the ipsilateral lung decreased from 27.66% to 20.7%, V5 of the contralateral lung decreased from 8.01% to 2.25%, V10 and V20 of the heart decreased from 35.23% and 16.77% to 19.22% and 10.6% respectively, V5 and V10 of the contralateral breast decreased from 35% and 10.39% to 20.38% and 5.7% respectively, all with significant difference. V30 and V40 of the ipsilateral lung and V40 of the heart increased by 1.28%, 1.48%, and 2.48%, with significant difference. CONCLUSION: Hybrid IMRT is a better choice for patients whose treatment position is inaccurate or cannot be repeated well."

Five left-sided breast cases were retrospectively planned using modulated photon and/or electron beams with an in-house treatment planning system (TPS), called CARMEN, and based on MC simulations. For comparison, the same cases were also planned by a PINNACLE TPS using conventional inverse intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Normal tissue complication probability for pericarditis, pneumonitis and breast fibrosis was calculated. CARMEN plans showed similar acceptable planning target volume (PTV) coverage as conventional IMRT plans with 90% of PTV volume covered by the prescribed dose (D(p)). Heart and ipsilateral lung receiving 5% D(p) and 15% D(p), respectively, was 3.2-3.6 times lower for CARMEN plans. Ipsilateral breast receiving 50% D(p) and 100% D(p) was an average of 1.4-1.7 times lower for CARMEN plans. Skin and whole body low-dose volume was also reduced. Modulated photon and/or electron beams planned by the CARMEN TPS improve APBI treatments by increasing normal tissue sparing maintaining the same PTV coverage achieved by other techniques. The use of the xMLC, already installed in the linac, to collimate photon and electron beams favors the clinical implementation of APBI with the highest efficiency."

We undertook this study to prospectively evaluate acute (</=90 days after last dose of radiotherapy) and long-term (>90 days) cutaneous, esophageal, and fibrosis toxicity and QoL in breast cancer patients treated by adjuvant IMRT after breast surgery. We included patients with complex volumes for which 3D RT does not allow a good coverage of target volumes and sparing organs at risk. We report here an interim analysis with a median follow-up of 13.1 months (range, 6.5-25.9 months). Most of the acute toxicity was cutaneous (95.9%) and oesophageal (59.6%), and mostly grade 1 and 2. Medium-term cutaneous toxicity rate was 25.6%, and mostly grade 1. Medium-term esophageal toxicity was rare (1.8%). In this series acute oesophageal toxicity was found to be associated with dosimetric factors. QoL was well preserved throughout the study, and aesthetic outcomes were good. Based on these data, tomotherapy may be a favorable alternative to other techniques in patients needing a complex irradiation of the breast and lymph node volumes."

Pathological and clinical data suggest that most recurrences of cancer in the ipsilateral breast are in the vicinity of the index lesion, and that remote recurrences are uncommon, whether or not whole-breast radiotherapy is delivered. These data lend support to the idea of partial-breast radiotherapy. Such a restricted treatment volume allows safe delivery of an accelerated hypofractionated regimen over a shortened course of 1 week. This technique differs from that of standard whole-breast tangential external-beam radiotherapy and necessitates investigation of accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). Several techniques of APBI are being investigated; however, most experience, and the most favourable early outcomes, has been obtained with image-guided breast brachytherapy.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen post-lumpectomy interstitial brachytherapy (IB) patients underwent imaging with preimplant computed tomography (CT) in the prone and supine position. These CT scans were then used to generate three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and prone and supine helical tomotherapy (PT and ST, respectively) APBI plans and compared with the treated IB plans. Dose-volume histogram analysis and the mean dose (NTD(mean)) values were compared. RESULTS: Planning target volume coverage was excellent for all methods. Statistical significance was considered to be a p value <0.05. The mean V100 was significantly lower for IB (12% vs. 15% for PT, 18% for ST, and 26% for 3D-CRT). A greater significant differential was seen when comparing V50 with mean values of 24%, 43%, 47%, and 52% for IB, PT, ST, and 3D-CRT, respectively. The IB and PT were similar and delivered an average lung NTD(mean) dose of 1.3 Gy(3) and 1.2 Gy(3), respectively. Both of these methods were statistically significantly lower than the supine external beam techniques. Overall, all four methods yielded similar low doses to the heart. CONCLUSIONS: The use of IB and PT resulted in greater normal tissue sparing (especially ipsilateral breast and lung) than the use of supine external beam techniques of 3D-CRT or ST. However, the choice of APBI technique must be tailored to the patient's anatomy, lumpectomy cavity location, and overall treatment goals."

There are scant data on the average or optimal volume of resection (VR) in BCT. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the percentage of patients who would be eligible for balloon catheter-based APBI based on the selection criteria of the American Society of Breast Surgeons and the surgical VR. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 443 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive carcinoma treated with BCT. Patient treatment and pathologic data were analyzed to assess VR and eligibility for APBI. RESULTS: BCT was performed for 178 patients with DCIS and 267 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. The majority of invasive carcinomas (63.3%) were infiltrating ductal carcinomas. The median overall lumpectomy volume was 67.61 cm3, with no significant difference between DCIS and invasive carcinoma (P>0.05). Although the majority (62.9-82.0%) of patients met the individual selection criteria for APBI, only 27.4% of the cohort was found to be eligible for any type of APBI when the selection criteria were considered together. Based on VR, only approximately one-half of the patients initially eligible for APBI would be candidates for immediate balloon catheter-based APBI using the 70 cm3 balloon device (13.3%). However, with the new, larger 125 cm3 balloon device, approximately three-fourths of patients initially eligible for APBI would be eligible for balloon catheter-based APBI at the time of the initial surgical procedure (20.7%). Although not evaluated in the current study, shrinkage of the lumpectomy cavity with time may increase the number of patients eligible based strictly on VR criteria. Patients with a very large VR (> or =125 cm3) were more likely to have invasive carcinoma (P=0.02; hazard ratio [HR], 7.4) and tumors > or =5 cm on final pathology (P<0.01; HR, 22.0). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-fifth to one-fourth of patients presenting for BCT may be eligible for balloon catheter-based APBI according to accepted national guidelines and VR. VR must be considered when selecting patients for balloon catheter-based APBI, because a minority of patients will have a lumpectomy cavity that exceeds the size limit of the current balloon device."

Increased rates of postoperative complications are described following postmastectomy RT. Neoadjuvant RT aims to improve the aesthetic results and simplify the reconstructive pathway. PATIENTS: A total of 22 patients diagnosed with LABC and treated with neoadjuvant RT followed by mastectomy and IBR between 04/2012 and 03/2015 were retrospectively analyzed. RT consisted of external beam RT to the breast and the regional lymphatics, if indicated. Both implant-based and autologous tissue-transfer reconstruction techniques were used. RESULTS: At the time of RT, 10 patients had no prior surgery and 12 patients had previously undergone breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with positive resection margins without the possibility to perform a second BCS. Additional neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 18 patients prior to RT. A complete pathological response was achieved in 55.0% of patients. The 2year overall survival rate was 89.3%, the 2year disease-free-survival 79.8% and the local-recurrence-free survival was 95.2%. The cosmetic result was excellent or good in 66% of the patients treated with upfront mastectomy and 37% of the patients who had previously undergone BCS. Among patients who received implant-based IBR, 4 patients developed serious wound-healing problems with implant loss. The most satisfactory results were achieved with autologous tissue reconstruction. CONCLUSION: A sequential neoadjuvant chemo-/radiotherapy to allow IBR following mastectomy in selected cases of LABC seems feasible and can be safely attempted. Careful patient selection, close monitoring, and continuous patient support is mandatory to ensure compliance in this treatment strategy."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate this new algorithm and to compare it to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for various disease sites by creating single- and double-arc VMAT plans. METHODS: A total of 162 plans were evaluated in this study, including 38 endometrial, 57 head and neck, 12 brain, 10 breast and 45 prostate cancer cases. The real-life IMRT plans were developed during routine clinical cases using the TPS Eclipse. VMAT plans were generated using a preclinical version of Eclipse with tumor-region-specific optimizing templates without interference of the operator: with one full arc (1A) and with two full arcs (2A), and with partial arcs for breast and prostate with hip implant cases. All plans were evaluated based on target coverage, homogeneity and conformity. The organs at risk (OARs) were analyzed according to plan objectives, such as the mean and maximum doses. If one or more objectives were exceeded, the plan was considered clinically unacceptable, and a second VMAT plan was created by adapting the optimization penalties once. RESULTS: Compared to IMRT, single- and double-arc VMAT plans showed comparable or better results concerning the target coverage: the maximum dose in the target for 1A is the same as that for IMRT; for 2A, an average reduction of 1.3% over all plans was observed. The conformity showed a statistically significant improvement for both 1A (+3%) and 2A (+6%). The mean total body dose was statistically significant lower for the considered arc techniques (IMRT: 16.0 Gy, VMAT: 15.3 Gy, p < 0.001). However, the sparing of OARs shows individual behavior that depends strongly on the different tumor regions. A clear difference is found in the number of monitor units (MUs) per plan: VMAT shows a reduction of 31%. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that based on optimizing templates with minimal interaction of the operator, the Eclipse TPS is able to achieve a plan quality for the Elekta VMAT delivery technique that is comparable to that of fixed-field IMRT. Plans with two arcs show better dose distributions than plans with one arc."

This study investigated the potential heart-sparing effect of volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT). We compared VMAT to tangential intensity-modulated radiotherapy (t-IMRT) in the loco-regional treatment of left-sided breast cancer, including internal mammary nodal irradiation, based on deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) and free-breathing (FB). METHODS: Radiotherapy for 15 patients was re-planned. Four plans were compared: t-IMRT-DIBH; VMAT-DIBH; t-IMRT-FB; VMAT-FB. Prescribed dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. T-IMRT plans were generated using tangentially orientated fields. VMAT plans were generated using two partial arcs (average arc 190 degrees ). RESULTS: Mean heart dose (MHD) was 5 +/- 2.4 Gy, 5.7 +/- 1.4 Gy, 9.7 +/- 3.3 Gy and 8.1 +/- 2.0 Gy for t-IMRT-DIBH, VMAT-DIBH, IMRT-FB and VMAT-FB respectively. The difference in MHD between IMRT-DIBH and VMAT-DIBH was not significant (P = 0.14). VMAT-DIBH significantly spared the volume of heart irradiated to doses of 20 Gy and above (p < 0.05), however, resulted in a significantly higher V5 Gy (P < 0.001), compared to t-IMRT-DIBH. VMAT-DIBH resulted in higher combined lung mean (11 +/- 0.8 Gy vs. 8.8 +/- 1.1 Gy, P < 0.001) and higher contralateral breast mean dose (5 +/- 1 Gy vs. 1.6 +/- 1.2 Gy, P < 0.001) compared with t-IMRT-DIBH. CONCLUSIONS: On average, there was no significant difference in MHD between VMAT-DIBH and t-IMRT-DIBH. However, VMAT-DIBH was found to benefit a select group of patients. For patients in whom the MHD was >6.3 Gy with t-IMRT-DIBH, the use of VMAT-DIBH resulted in a benefit in reducing the MHD."

Its use obviates the need for a medial wedge, thus reducing scatter to the opposite breast. Although lung density correction is used at many centers in planning for early-stage breast cancer, long-term results of local control and survival have not been reported. Since 1984, we have used lung density correction for dose calculations at the University of Michigan. We now present our 10-year and 15-year results. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 867 patients with Stage I/II breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and RT with or without systemic therapy were reviewed. Tangential fields delivering 45-50 Gy to the whole breast calculated using lung density correction were used. A boost was added in 96.8% of patients for a total median dose of 61.8 Gy. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6.6 years (range, 0.2-18.9 years), 5-, 10-, and 15-year actuarial rates of in-breast tumor recurrence as only first failure were 2.2%, 3.6%, and 5.4%, respectively. With surgical salvage, the 15-year cumulative rate of local control was 99.7%. Factors that significantly predicted for increased rate of local recurrence in multivariate analysis were age </= 35 years, hazard ratio 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-13.9) p = 0.004; negative progesterone receptor status, hazard ratio 6.8 (95% CI, 2.3-20.3) p = < 0.001; negative estrogen receptor status, hazard ratio 4.0 (95% CI, 1.5-11.1) p = 0.007; and lack of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, hazard ratio 7.7 (95% CI, 1.7-33.3) p = 0.008. Relapse-free survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years were 84.6%, 70.8%, and 55.9%, respectively; breast cancer-specific survival rates were 94.4%, 90.5%, and 86.9%, respectively; and corresponding estimates for overall survival were 89.7%, 75.7%, and 61.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Use of lung density correction was associated with high rates of local control, relapse-free survival, breast cancer-specific survival, and overall survival compared with other reported series of breast-conserving surgery and RT in early-stage disease. These results will serve as a benchmark against which newer radiation delivery strategies such as intensity-modulated RT and partial breast RT can be compared."

There are special cases where proton therapy may offer a substantial potential benefit compared to photon treatments where toxicity concerns dominate. Re-irradiation may theoretically be made safer with proton therapy due to lower cumulative lifetime doses to sensitive tissues, such as the spinal cord. Proton therapy has been used in a limited number of patients with rectal, pancreatic, esophageal, and lung cancers. Chordomas and soft tissue sarcomas require particularly high radiation doses, posing additional challenges for re-irradiation. Lymphoma is another special case where proton therapy may be advantageous. Late toxicities from even relatively low radiation doses, including cardiac complications and second cancers, are of concern in lymphoma patients with high cure rates and long life expectancies. Proton therapy has begun to be used for consolidation after chemotherapy in patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Breast cancer is another emerging area of proton therapy development and use. Proton therapy may offer advantages compared to other techniques in the setting of breast boosts, accelerated partial breast irradiation, and post-mastectomy radiotherapy. In these settings, proton therapy may decrease toxicity associated with breast radiotherapy. As techniques are refined in proton therapy, we may be able to improve the therapeutic ratio by maintaining the benefits of radiotherapy while better minimizing the risks."
G. Plataniotis,2010,Hypofractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of early breast cancer,Breast conservation Early breast cancer Hypofractionation Radiotherapy,0,35,eng,"Radiotherapy (RT) after tumorectomy in early breast cancer patients is an established treatment modality which conventionally takes 6-7 wk to complete. Shorter RT schedules have been tested in large multicentre randomized trials and have shown equivalent results to that of standard RT (50 Gy in 25 fractions) in terms of local tumor control, patient survival and late post-radiation effects. Some of those trials have now completed 10 years of follow-up with encouraging results for treatments of 3-4 wk and a total RT dose to the breast of 40-42.5 Gy with or without boost. A reduction of 50% in treatment time makes those RT schedules attractive for both patients and health care providers and would have a significant impact on daily RT practice around the world, as it would accelerate patient turnover and save health care resources. However, in hypofractionated RT, a higher (than the conventional 1.8-2 Gy) dose per fraction is given and should be managed with caution as it could result in a higher rate of late post-radiation effects in breast, heart, lungs and the brachial plexus. It is therefore advisable that both possible dose inhomogeneity and normal tissue protection should be taken into account and the appropriate technology such as three-dimensional/intensity modulated radiation therapy employed in clinical practice, when hypofractionation is used."

Reexcision followed by reirradiation using interstitial breast implants has also been implemented as an alternative to mastectomy to treat ipsilateral breast local recurrence after previous breast-conserving therapy. In the past two decades, the new concept of accelerated partial breast irradiation opened a new perspective for breast brachytherapy. The first technique utilized in early accelerated partial breast irradiation studies was multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy. Beyond classical interstitial brachytherapy, recently, new intracavitary applicators have been developed in the United States to decrease the existing barriers against the widespread use of multicatheter brachytherapy. Furthermore, interstitial low-dose-rate seed implants have also been implemented as an alternative for stepping-source multicatheter brachytherapy.

With the advent of breast-screening, incidence of breast carcinomas with more favorable prognostic characteristics has increased significantly. This change in the prognostic profile of newly diagnosed breast cancers opened a new horizon for clinical research seeking for individual risk-adapted protocols of breast cancer radiotherapy. Several groups have been tested the efficacy of accelerated (partial or whole) breast irradiation, which has become the new treatment paradigm in the radiotherapy of early-stage breast cancers. Furthermore, others have attempted to identify subgroups of patients for whom radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery could be safely omitted. Recently molecular gene expression assays have emerged as promising prognostic and predictive markers for local recurrence. This article reviews the results of these studies focusing on individual risk-adapted radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for patients with early-stage breast carcinoma."

CG-Darc plans were generated using two tangential couch arcs combined with a simultaneous noncoplanar gantry arc. The dynamic couch arc was modeled by consecutive IMRT fields at 10 degrees intervals. RapidArc plans used a single partial arc with an avoidance sector, preventing direct beam exit into the thorax. CG-Darc and RapidArc plans were compared with 3D CRT in 20 patients previously treated with 3D CRT (group A), and in 15 additional patients who failed the dosimetric constraints of the Canadian trial and of NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 for APBI (group B). CG-Darc resulted in superior target coverage compared to 3D CRT and RapidArc (V95%: 98.2% vs. 97.1% and 95.7%). For outer breast lesions, CG-Darc and RapidArc significantly reduced the ipsilateral breast V50% by 8% in group A and 15% in group B (p &lt; 0.05) as compared with 3D CRT. For inner and centrally located lesions, CG-Darc resulted in significant ipsilateral lung V10% reduction when compared to 3D CRT and RapidArc (10.7% vs. 12.6% and 20.7% for group A, and 15.1% vs. 25.2% and 27.3% for group B). Similar advantage was observed in the dosimetry of contralateral breast where the percent maximum dose for CG-Darc, 3D CRT, and RapidArc were 3.9%, 6.3%, and 5.8% for group A and 4.3%, 9.2%, and 6.3% for group B, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). CG-Darc achieved superior target coverage while decreasing normal tissue dose even in patients failing APBI dose constraints. Consequently, this technique has the potential of expanding the use of APBI to patients currently ineligible for such treatment. Modification of the RapidArc algorithm will be necessary to link couch and gantry rotation with variable dose rate and, therefore, enable the use of CG-Darc in clinical practice."

The major recent changes in the use of radiotherapy for breast cancer have been the following: the establishment of partial breast irradiation (PBI) as an option for therapy in early stage disease; the revival of hypofractionated therapies for breast only therapy; the clearer definition of the role of post-mastectomy irradiation; and the continuing investigation as to which patients having conservative surgery do not need radiation therapy. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy is still not widely accepted to be medically necessary in breast cancer, but ongoing studies may demonstrate that it will prove to be useful in treating node-positive breast cancer when wide-field nodal targets need to be included in the treatment volume. Image-guided radiotherapy will prove to be necessary for PBI by external beam to keep the irradiated treatment volumes within long-term tolerance. The optimum dose and delivery schedule for PBI is yet to be finalized. Overall, the local control rates for all breast cancer treatment scenarios are generally good, and therefore, the emphasis is now on maintaining local control while reducing toxicities from treatment. The long-term risks of breast cancer radiotherapy on subsequent cancer induction are subject to ongoing studies. Biological enhancement of the effect of radiotherapy could allow dose reduction, with presumed reductions in the toxicity of treatment. In conclusion, breast cancer radiotherapy has much to understand and optimize in the 21st Century."

In this study, the CLB dose was measured using MOSFET dosimeter in 49 patients who underwent breast conservation surgery treated by different radiotherapy tangential field techniques, which included enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW), physical wedge, and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The mean percent of the prescribed dose received by the contralateral areola in treatment technique using physical wedge (Cobalt), physical wedge (Linac), EDW, and IMRT were 4.27% (SD: 0.65), 3.61% (SD: 0.60), 3.38% (SD: 0.58), and 1.65% (SD: 0.24), respectively. There was a 29% CLB dose reduction at 3 cm from the medial tangential field border with IMRT compared to other wedged tangential field techniques.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: V-MAT and the standard, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), were compared retrospectively in 8 patients previously treated with PBI. These patients' plans were replanned with a single partial arc using V-MAT that included partial blocking to minimize normal tissue dose. Dosimetric parameters were calculated to evaluate plan quality. Quality assurance studies included verifying both the point and the multiple planar doses. Total monitor units and delivery time were also evaluated, and collision clearance was analyzed. RESULTS: Volumes of ipsilateral lung irradiated to 10 Gy (V10) and 20 Gy (V20) by V-MAT were significantly less than those of 3D-CRT (p = 0.03 for V10 and p = 0.025 for V20). The volume of ipsilateral breast irradiated to 5 Gy was significantly less by using V-MAT than with 3D-CRT (p = 0.02), with a ratio of integrated dose of <1.00. The total mean monitor units (489 +/- 38) for V-MAT were significantly less than those for 3D-CRT (634 +/- 123) (p = 0.017), with a 23% reduction. The average machine delivery time was 1.21 +/- 0.10 min for the V-MAT plans and 6.28 +/- 1.40 min for the 3D-CRT plans, resulting in a reduction factor of 80.1%. The conformity indexes were 1.3 in the V-MAT plans and 1.5 in the 3D-CRT plans (p = 0.102). CONCLUSIONS: V-MAT technology is feasible for PBI patients. Compared to a conventional 3D-CRT technique, it is more efficient, offers equivalent or better dose conformity, delivers lower doses to the ipsilateral lung and breast, and may potentially reduce intrafractional motion."

Here we determine at what amplitude respiratory management may be required to maintain plan quality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients were planned with PBI IMRT. Respiratory motion (2-20 mm amplitude) probability density functions were convolved with static plan fluence to estimate the delivered dose. Evaluation metrics included target coverage, ipsilateral breast hotspot, homogeneity, and uniformity indices. RESULTS: Degradation of dose homogeneity was the limiting factor in reduction of plan quality due to respiratory motion, not loss of coverage. Hotspot increases were observed even at typical motion amplitudes. At 2 and 5 mm, 2/10 plans had a hotspot greater than 107% and at 10 mm this increased to 5/10 plans. Target coverage was only compromised at larger amplitudes: 5/10 plans did not meet coverage criteria at 15 mm amplitude and no plans met minimum coverage at 20 mm. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that if respiratory amplitude is greater than 10 mm, respiratory management or alternative radiotherapy should be considered due to an increase in the hotspot in the ipsilateral breast and a decrease in dose homogeneity."

We examine which characteristics of the breast and seroma result in unacceptable plan degradation due to respiration. METHODS: Thirty-six patient datasets were planned with inverse-optimised PBI IMRT. Population respiratory data were used to create a probability density function. This probability density function (PDF) was convolved with the static plan fluences to calculate the delivered dose with respiration. To quantify the difference between static and respiratory plan quality, we analysed the mean dose shift of the target dose volume histogram (DVH), the dose shift at 95% of the volume and the dose shift at the hotspot to 2 cm(3)of the volume. We explore which patient characteristics indicate a clinically significant degradation in delivered plan quality due to respiration. RESULTS: Dose homogeneity constraints, rather than dosimetric coverage, were the limiting factors for all patient plans. We propose the dose evaluation volume-to-planning target volume (DEV-to-PTV) ratio as a delineating metric for identifying patient plans that will be more degraded by respiratory motion. The DEV-to-PTV ratio may be a more robust metric than ipsilateral breast volume because the seroma volume is contoured more consistently between physicians and clinics. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with a DEV-to-PTV ratio less than 55% we recommend either not using PBI IMRT or employing motion management. Small DEV-to-PTV ratios occur when the seroma is close to inhomogeneities (i.e. air/lung), which exacerbates the dosimetric effect of respiratory motion. For small breast sizes it is unlikely that the DEV-to-PTV ratio will meet these criteria."

The methodology for the development of class solutions for dosimetric planning of the APBI technique, including dose constraint recommendations, is presented for target coverage and conformity as well as normal tissues. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A conservative patient setup was simulated on a linear accelerator, and a comprehensive arrangement of gantry and couch angles was measured for clearance. This provided the foundation for available beam arrangements to develop reproducible and conformal 5-field intensity modulated radiation therapy partial breast plans. Forty patients were planned. Patient plans were assessed according to anatomy specific features, such as laterality and seroma location within the breast. RESULTS: Clearance tables are presented to give permissible gantry and couch orientations according to measurements facilitated by patient simulation. Beam arrangement class solutions are presented for left- and right-sided APBI patients. Dosimetric recommendations are made based on the results of 40 patient plans. The median and range, describing target coverage and target conformity, are reported, as are normal tissue constraints for ipsilateral lung, ipsilateral breast, heart, liver, and contralateral breast. In all cases, the dose recommendations were at least as strict as multi-institutional APBI trials. In the case of ipsilateral lung and ipsilateral breast, the planning recommendations are more stringent. CONCLUSIONS: APBI using a 5-field intensity modulated radiation therapy technique was comprehensively developed and evaluated to provide recommendations yielding highly conformal and reproducible treatment plans. This provides a clear method to implement external beam APBI planning and delivery."

However, the exit dose to the skin is a major concern and can be a limiting factor for these treatments. Most treatment planning systems (TPSs) currently used for high dose-rate (HDR) 192Ir brachytherapy overestimate the exit skin dose because they assume a homogeneous water medium and do not account for finite patient dimensions. The purpose of this work was to quantify the TPS overestimation of the exit skin dose for a group of patients and several phantom configurations. METHODS: The TPS calculated skin dose for 59 HDR 192Ir APBI patients was compared to the skin dose measured with LiF:Mg,Ti thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). Additionally, the TPS calculated dose was compared to the TLD measured dose and the Monte Carlo (MC) calculated dose for eight phantom configurations. Four of the phantom configurations simulated treatment conditions with no scattering material beyond the point of measurement and the other four configurations simulated the homogeneous scattering conditions assumed by the TPS. Since the calibration TLDs for this work were irradiated with 137Cs and the experimental irradiations were performed with 192Ir, experiments were performed to determine the intrinsic energy dependence of the TLDs. Correction factors that relate the dose at the point of measurement (center of TLD) to the dose at the point of interest (basal skin layer) were also determined and applied for each irradiation geometry. RESULTS: The TLD intrinsic energy dependence for 192Ir relative to 137Cs was 1.041 +/- 1.78%. The TPS overestimated the exit skin dose by an average of 16% for the group of 59 patients studied, and by 9%-15% for the four phantom setups simulating treatment conditions. For the four phantom setups simulating the conditions assumed by the TPS, the TPS calculated dose agreed well with the TLD and MC results (within 3% and 1%, respectively). The inverse square geometry correction factor ranged from 1.023 to 1.042, and an additional correction factor of 0.978 was applied to account for the lack of charged particle equilibrium in the TLD and basal skin layer. CONCLUSIONS: TPS calculations that assume a homogeneous water medium overestimate the exit skin dose for intracavitary APBI treatments. It is important to determine the actual skin dose received during intracavitary APBI to determine the skin dose-response relationship and establish dose limits for optimal skin sparing. This study has demonstrated that TLDs can measure the skin dose with an expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of 5.6% when the proper corrections are applied."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 26 left-sided early-stage breast cancer patients were selected for this study. To find the superior plan, H-VMAT with three different arc designs including, two partial arcs (2A), four partial arcs (4A) and four tangential arcs (TA) were created for each study case by combining 3DCRT and VMAT with 75% 3DCRT/25% VMAT dose proportion of prescription dose. RESULTS: All H-VMAT plans achieved the expected target coverage. A higher conformity index and homogeneity index were achieved for 2A and 4A H-VMAT plans and significantly differ from TA H-VMAT (p < 0.003). The heart and ipsilateral lung dose parameters were comparable among all plans except heart V40Gy which was significantly less in 4A H-VMAT plan (p < 0.05). The contralateral lung, contralateral breast, spinal cord, normal tissue doses and MU were significantly less in TA H-VMAT (p < 0.03). The beam-on time was significantly less in 2A H-VMAT (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: 2A and 4A H-VMAT techniques are effective in improving the PTV dosimetric parameters as well as reducing the OAR doses. Further, 2A H-VMAT delivers less MU and beam-on time compared to 4A H-VMAT."

One-hundred-seventy-eight patients enrolled in a prospective randomized phase III trial to compare the efficacy of ELIOT (a single dose of 21 Gy prescribed at the 90% isodose) versus EBRT (50 Gy to the whole breast plus a 10 Gy boost to the tumour bed), underwent a spiral 16-detector row Computed Tomography (CT) examination to assess RT-induced pulmonary fibrosis: 83 patients in the EBRT arm and 95 in the ELIOT arm. All patients (age range 48-75 years) were affected by unicentric infiltrating carcinoma of the breast with diameter < 2.5 cm. This study was approved by our Institutional Ethical Committee and informed consent was obtained from each patient. Two observers, blinded to patient's randomization, independently evaluated each CT examination and assigned a fibrosis score (Grades 0 to 3). Inter-observer agreement for the fibrosis score was evaluated and a consensus between observers was obtained. Differences in fibrosis score between the two arms were evaluated by Chi Square test and Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Pulmonary fibrosis was diagnosed in 42 patients (23.6%): 38 (90%) were in the EBRT arm and 4 (10%) in the ELIOT arm (p < 0.0001); twenty-six of them were Grade 1 (one ELIOT), fifteen were Grade 2 (three ELIOT) and one was Grade 3. The post-radiotherapy risk in the EBRT arm to develop at least Grade 1 fibrosis was 19 times higher than in the ELIOT one (OR: 19.20; 95%CI: 6.46-57.14) and 6 times higher to develop at least Grade 2 (OR: 5.70; 95%CI: 1.56-20.76). In conclusion, CT detected pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated with ELIOT is significantly less frequent compared to patients treated with EBRT."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The ABC apparatus was used to immobilize the breathing motion with a computer-controlled valve. Immobilization of the lungs in breast cancer patients was used as a model to evaluate the reproducibility of mDIBH using the ABC apparatus. CT scans were acquired twice at mDIBH in the same session for 30 breast cancer patients. Twenty-three of them were immobilized with an alpha-cradle, of which 14 had a repeat scan at mDIBH 1-4 weeks later. Twelve of those patients received intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the left breast at mDIBH to displace the heart from the beam. The remaining patients were treated at free breathing, with either intensity-modulated irradiation to the whole breast or conformal partial breast irradiation. To remove the component of setup error, mDIBH scans were registered with respect to the vertebrae. The lungs and carina were auto-contoured to form 3D surfaces for each data set. The closest distance-to-agreement (DTA) for each point between the 3D surfaces of the corresponding CT scans was displayed on a 3D surface map. For analysis, each lung was divided along its inferior to superior extent into six regions, from the basal 10%, the next four consecutive 20% sections in height, to the last apical 10%. Likewise, the carina was divided into regions of the trachea and bifurcation. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the DTA for each of these regions was computed. RESULTS: With the patient positioned in an alpha-cradle, the mean +/- SD intrafraction DTA was 1.5 +/- 1.4 mm for the left lung and 1.0 +/- 1.4 mm for the right lung. The corresponding values without the use of an alpha-cradle were significantly greater, with 1.9 +/- 2.1 mm and 2.2 +/- 2.2 mm for the left and right lung, respectively (p <0.005 for the SD of the left lung and p <0.0003 for the SD of the right lung). The interfraction DTA for the left and right lungs was 1.4 +/- 1.7 mm and 1.4 +/- 1.6 mm, respectively. The regional analysis demonstrated better immobilization for the upper two-thirds of the chest wall compared with that for the lung base. The DTA values obtained for the tracheal bifurcation were 0.9 +/- 0.8 mm for intrafraction and 1.4 +/- 1.0 mm for interfraction. CONCLUSION: The ABC device can be used to reduce respiratory motion at mDIBH in breast cancer patients or those patients who can perform the maneuver. This device demonstrated excellent intra- and interfraction reproducibility of chest wall and carina immobilization, especially when combined with alpha-cradle immobilization. Internal margins for suspended breathing can be extrapolated from these data for various anatomic regions within the lung and chest wall."

The impact of set-up and dose variables upon organs at risk (OAR) dose in DIBH RT was investigated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients with left-breast cancer referred between 2011 and 2014 - of all disease stages, set-up variations, and dose prescriptions - were included. Radiographers used simple screening criteria at CT simulation, to systematically assess patients for obvious DIBH benefit and capability. Selected patients received forward-planned intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) based on a DIBH CT scan. A 3D-surface monitoring system with visual feedback assured reproducible DIBH positioning during gated radiation delivery. Patient, target set-up, and OAR dose information were collected at treatment. RESULTS: Of 272 patients who were screened, 4 withdrew, 56 showed no obvious advantage, and 56 showed benefit but had suitability issues; 156 patients were selected and successfully completed DIBH treatment. The technique was compatible with complex set-up and optimal target coverage was maintained. Comparison of free-breathing (FB) and DIBH treatment plans in the first five patients enrolled confirmed DIBH reduced heart radiation by ~80% (p = 0.032). Low OAR doses were achieved overall: the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) heart dose was 1.17 (1.12-1.22) Gy, and the mean ipsilateral lung dose was 5.26 (5.01-5.52) Gy. Patients who underwent a standard radiation schedule (40 Gy/15#) after breast-conserving surgery had the lowest OAR doses: post-mastectomy treatment, simultaneous supraclavicular (SCV) node coverage, and alternative dose schedule (50 Gy/25#) were interrelated variables associated with increased OAR risk and compromised ipsilateral lung dose constraints. CONCLUSION: The DIBH technique was successfully implemented and resulted in optimally low heart radiation. All patients who demonstrate sufficient DIBH technique at planning CT are now offered DIBH RT at our clinic. Patients with more advanced disease, particularly those with additional pulmonary risk factors, warrant additional focus to improve lung sparing."

For breast cancer, the main goals when using IMRT were to improve dose homogeneity within the breast and to enhance coverage of complex target volumes. Nonetheless, better heart and lung protections are achievable with IMRT as compared to standard irradiation for difficult cases. Three prospective randomized controlled trials of IMRT versus standard treatment showed that a better breast homogeneity can translate into better overall cosmetic results. Dosimetric and clinical studies seem to indicate a benefit of IMRT for lymph nodes irradiation, bilateral treatment, left breast and chest wall radiotherapy, or accelerated partial breast irradiation. The multiple technical IMRT solutions available tend to indicate a widespread use for breast irradiation. Nevertheless, indications for breast IMRT should be personalized and selected according to the expected benefit for each individual."

Among the available techniques, volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is attractive but has not been extensively studied for APBI. This study assessed its feasibility, tolerance and early oncological outcomes. METHODS: We analysed the data of nine patients (median age 74 years) with ten lesions (one bilateral cancer) treated from May 2011 to July 2012 with APBI using VMAT. The radiation oncologist delineated the surgical tumour bed, and added an 18 mm isotropic margin to obtain the planning target volume (PTV). The dose was 40 Gy prescribed in 4 Gy fractions given twice a day over five days. Patients were regularly followed for toxicities and oncological outcomes. RESULTS: Mean PTV was 100.0 cm(3) and 95 % of the PTV received a mean dose of 99.7 % of the prescribed dose. Hot spots represented 0.3 % of the PTV. 6.2 %, 1.6 % and 0.3 % of the ipsilateral lung volume received 5 Gy (V5Gy), 10 Gy (V10Gy) and 20 Gy (V20Gy), respectively. Regarding the contralateral lung, V5Gy was 0.3 %, and V10Gy and V20Gy were nil. V5Gy accounted for 3.1 % of the heart. An average 580 monitor units were delivered. No acute or late grade >/= 2 toxicities were observed. With a median follow-up of 26 months, no relapses occurred.

For clinical success, the elastography method needs to be robust to the sources of decorrelation between ultrasound images, specifically fluid motions inside the cavity, change of the appearance of speckles caused by compression or physiologic motions, and out-of-plane motion of the probe. In this paper, we present a novel elastography technique that is based on analytic minimization of a regularized cost function. The cost function incorporates similarity of RF data intensity and displacement continuity, making the method robust to small decorrelations present throughout the image. We also exploit techniques from robust statistics to make the method resistant to large decorrelations caused by sources such as fluid motion. The analytic displacement estimation works in real-time. Moreover, the tracked data, used for targeting the radiotherapy, is exploited for discarding frames with excessive out-of-plane motion. Simulation, phantom and patient results are presented."

However, questions have been raised about the potential of f IORT to produce breast parenchymal changes that could interfere with mammographic surveillance of cancer recurrence. The purpose of this study was to identify, quantify, and compare the mammographic findings of patients who received IORT and EBRT in a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of women with early stage invasive breast cancer undergoing breast conserving therapy between July 2005 and December 2009. Treatment groups were compared with regard to the 1, 2 and 4-year incidence of 6 post-operative mammographic findings: architectural distortion, skin thickening, skin retraction, calcifications, fat necrosis, and mass density. Blinded review of 90 sets of mammograms of 15 IORT and 16 EBRT patients demonstrated a higher incidence of fat necrosis among IORT recipients at years 1, 2, and 4. However, none of the subjects were judged to have suspicious mammogram findings and fat necrosis did not interfere with mammographic interpretation."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to identify women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer from 1998 to 2007 who underwent breast-conserving surgery. We assessed the temporal trends in, and costs of, the adoption of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and brachytherapy. Using hierarchical logistic regression, we evaluated the relationship between the use of these new modalities and patient and regional characteristics. RESULTS: Of 35,060 patients, 69.9% received conventional external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Although overall radiation therapy use remained constant, the use of IMRT increased from 0.0% to 12.6% from 1998 to 2007, and brachytherapy increased from 0.7% to 9.0%. The statistical variation in brachytherapy use attributable to the radiation oncologist and geographic region was 41.4% and 9.5%, respectively (for IMRT: 23.8% and 22.1%, respectively). Women undergoing treatment at a free-standing radiation facility were significantly more likely to receive IMRT than were women treated at a hospital-based facility (odds ratio for IMRT vs EBRT: 3.89 [95% confidence interval, 2.78-5.45]). No such association was seen for brachytherapy. The median radiation therapy cost per treated patient increased from $5389 in 2001 to $8539 in 2007. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT and brachytherapy use increased substantially from 1998 to 2007; overall, radiation therapy costs increased by more than 50%. Radiation oncologists played an important role in treatment choice for both types of radiation therapy, whereas geographic region played a bigger role in the use of IMRT than brachytherapy."

All patients in this study were treated with a single-entry, multicatheter device for 10 fractions to a total dose of 34 Gy. A mark was placed on the patient's skin on the medial aspect of the opposite breast. Three TLD packets were taped to this mark during the pretreatment simulation. Simulations consisted of an AP and Lateral scout and a limited axial scan encompassing the lumpectomy cavity (miniscan), if rotation was a concern. After the simulation the TLD packets were removed and the patients were moved to the high-dose-rate (HDR) vault where three new TLD packets were taped onto the patients at the skin mark. Treatment was administered with a Nucletron HDR afterloader using Iridium-192 as the treatment source. Post-treatment, TLDs were read (along with the simulation and QA TLD and a set of standards exposed to a known dose of 6 MV photons). Measurements indicate an average total dose to the contralateral breast of 70 cGy for outer quadrant implants and 181 cGy for inner quadrant implants. Compared to external beam breast tangents, these results point to less dose being delivered to the contralateral breast when using APBI."

In this technical note we describe our method of whole breast or chest wall irradiation using helical tomotherapy based image-guided, hypofractionated, simultaneous in-field boost intensity modulated radiation therapy. We have observed that excellent dose-distributions can be achieved with helical tomotherapy through a careful selection of treatment planning parameters. Dose homogeneity to the whole breast and simultaneously targeted lumpectomy region appears superior to conventional tangents"" with minimal hot or cold spots. Dose-volume histogram analysis documents effective reduction of high dose to critical sensitive structures (heart and lung) although a greater volume of these non-target organs receives low dose compared to what is typical with tangential beams. Treatment planning is efficient and is usually completed within one to two hours, although physician contouring requires more time and attention than non-IMRT approaches. Pretreatment megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging has proved invaluable in aiding set-up and engenders greater confidence that the planned IMRT dose distributions are truly being delivered. In some situations, MVCT can provide visual feedback when a seroma or overall breast volume has changed significantly since simulation, thereby identifying cases where replanning might be prudent. Treatment is brief, typically completed in 6 to 9 minutes. Initial clinical application has confirmed the feasibility and practicality of helical tomotherapy as an efficient means of administering radiation therapy for routine breast-conserving therapy and post-mastectomy chest wall irradiation. A simultaneous in-field boost technique reduces the length of the overall course by about a week thereby adding convenience and reducing costs. Further refinements of our technique are being explored and formal prospective clinical evaluation is underway."""

METHOD AND MATERIAL: The breasts (Right side: Left side = 1:1), heart, and lungs of 28 patients were contoured on all the computed tomography (CT)-slice. Three different treatment plans were created: (1) inverse IMRT (iIMRT), (2) forward IMRT (fIMRT), and (3) conventional tangential technique (CVT). The total prescribed dose for all plans was 50 Gy/25 fractions. All treatment plans were normalized at 95% of the prescribed dose covered the entire PTV and used inhomogeneity corrections. RESULTS: For the entire group, the mean breast volume was 517 cc. The V105% for iIMRT, fIMRT and conventional plans was 1.12%, 2.36% and 16.81%, which iIMRT better than fIMRT and CVT (p < 0.001) and fIMRT better than CVT (p < 0.05). The Dmax for the iIMRT plan received 105.03%, which was significantly less than those from the fIMRT(106.6%, p < 0.001) and the conventional (110.68%, p < 0.001) plan. The PTV coverage (V95-105%) for the iIMRT, fIMRTand conventional was 96%, 91% and 87%, which iIMRT better than fIMRT and CVT (p < 0.05) and fIMRT better than CVT (p < 0.05). The PTV CI for the iIMRT technique was 0.704, which was significantly more conformity than those from the fIMRT (0.639, p < 0.001) and the conventional (0.539, p < 0.001) techniques. The PTV CI of fIMRT is significantly better than CVT (p < 0.005). Mean ipsilateral lung dose was 642.7 cGy, 747.6 cGy and 882.25 cGy for iIMRT fIMRT and CVT respectively (p < 0.05) The V20Gy reduced from 14.87% for conventional plan to 12.82% for the fIMRT plan, while 0.88% was obtained for the iIMRT plan (P<0.05). The heart V30 Gy value was 3.124%, 4.65%, and 5.84% for iIMRT, fIMRT and conventional plans, respectively (p < 0.05). The mean dose of contralateral breast was 55.86 cGy, 60.33 cGy, 68.57 cGy for iIMRT, fIMRT and conventional plans, respectively (p < 0.05 both). The mean contralateral lung dose was 57.8 cGy, 43.87 cGy, and 32.28 cGy for iIMRT, fIMRT and conventional plans, respectively (p < 0.005 both). CONCLUSION: The iIMRT technique provides significantly improved PTV Dmax, PTV V105%, PTV V110%, target volume coverage, dose homogeneity and dose conformity throughout the target volume of breast and reduced doses to all critical structures, compared to the fIMRT and conventional techniques. In view of fIMRT technique, it significantly improved the dose distribution and reduced dose to OARs compared to conventional technique, although not better than iIMRT technique."

METHODS: Two-hundred and sixty-six breast cancer patients with postoperative radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery or mastectomy were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were treated with HF (15 fractions of 2.67 Gy; n = 121) or CF (28 fractions of 1.8 Gy or 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy; n = 145) and TB-IMRT (n = 151) or 3DCRT (n = 115). The acute skin reactions were prospectively assessed using the CTCAE v4 grading scale. Ordinal regression analysis was used to assess the impact of possible prognostic factors on the maximal acute skin reaction. RESULTS: Grade 2 skin reactions were observed in 19 % of the patients treated with CF compared to 2 % treated with HF. On univariate analysis, the fractionation regimen, the PTV (breast versus chest wall), the volume of the PTV and the body mass index were significant prognostic factors for the maximum acute skin reaction. On multivariate analysis, the fractionation regimen (p < 0.00001) and the volume of the PTV (p = 0.0002) remained as independent significant factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that HF is associated with a significantly reduced maximal acute skin reaction compared to CF."

A randomised phase 3 trial demonstrated that PBI using multicatheter brachytherapy had an equivalent rate of local recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival as compared to WBI. However, limited data are available on PBI efficacy for young patients with breast cancer. METHODS: We evaluated consecutive patients with Tis-2 (</= 3 cm) N0-1 breast cancer who underwent BCT. For PBI, patients received radiotherapy using multicatheter brachytherapy in an accelerated manner with a dose of 32 Gy in eight fractions over 5-6 days. For WBI, patients received an external beam radiation therapy that was applied to the entire breast with a total dose of 50 Gy in fractions of 2 Gy for 5 weeks. Two hundred seventy-four patients with 278 lesions received PBI; 190 patients with 193 lesions received WBI. RESULTS: Patients aged <50 years including 98 women with 99 lesions receiving PBI and 85 women with 85 lesions receiving WBI were selected. Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate was 3.0 and 2.4 % by PBI and WBI, respectively (P = 0.99). There was no significant difference in 4-year probability of disease-free survival (97.6 and 91.4 % for PBI and WBI, respectively; P = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of PBI efficacy in young patients in Asia. Although it is a nonrandomized retrospective chart review of a small cohort of patients with a relatively short follow-up period, PBI may be a better option than WBI following BCS in some young patients with breast cancer."

Three out of 50 patients were irradiated bilaterally (53 tumours in 50 patients). All patients were enrolled in a phase I-II trial approved by the ICH ethical committee. All 50 patients enrolled in the study underwent VMAT-SIB technique to irradiate the whole breast with concomitant boost irradiation of the tumor bed. Doses to whole breast and surgical bed were 40.5 Gy and 48 Gy respectively, delivered in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Skin toxicities were recorded during and after treatment according to RTOG acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria with a median follow-up of 12 months (range 8-16).

No Grade 4 toxicities were observed. All Grade 1 toxicities had resolved within 3 weeks. No significant differences in cosmetic scores on baseline assessment vs. 3 months and 6 months after the treatment were observed: all patients were scored as excellent/good (50/50) compared with baseline; no fair/poor judgment was recorded. No other toxicities or local failures were recorded during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The 3-week course of postoperative radiation using VMAT with SIB showed to be feasible and was associated with acceptable acute skin toxicity profile. Long-term follow-up data are needed to assess late toxicity and clinical outcomes."

The present recommendations are based on a revision of the German interdisciplinary S-3 guidelines published in July 2012. METHODS: A comprehensive survey of the literature concerning radiotherapy following breast conserving therapy (BCT) was performed using the search terms breast cancer"", ""radiotherapy"", and ""breast conserving therapy"". Data from lately published meta-analyses, recent randomized trials, and guidelines of international breast cancer societies, yielding new aspects compared to 2007, provided the basis for defining recommendations according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine. In addition to the more general statements of the DKG (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft), this paper addresses indications, target definition, dosage, and technique of radiotherapy of the breast after conservative surgery for invasive breast cancer. RESULTS: Among numerous reports on the effect of radiotherapy during BCT published since the last recommendations, the recent EBCTCG report builds the largest meta-analysis so far available. In a 15 year follow-up on 10,801 patients, whole breast irradiation (WBI) halves the average annual rate of disease recurrence (RR 0.52, 0.48-0.56) and reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by about one sixth (RR 0.82, 0.75-0.90), with a similar proportional, but different absolute benefit in prognostic subgroups (EBCTCG 2011). Furthermore, there is growing evidence that risk-adapted dose augmentation strategies to the tumor bed as well as the implementation of high precision RT techniques (e.g., intraoperative radiotherapy) contribute substantially to a further reduction of local relapse rates. A main focus of ongoing research lies in partial breast irradiation strategies as well as WBI hypofractionation schedules. The potential of both in replacing normofractionated WBI has not yet been finally clarified. CONCLUSION: After breast conserving surgery, no subgroup even in low risk patients has yet been identified for whom radiotherapy can be safely omitted without compromising local control and, hence, cancer-specific survival. In most patients, this translates into an overall survival benefit."""

METHODS AND RESULTS: A survey of the literature was performed including publications between 2002 and 2012 (PubMed). Strategies comprised partial breast radiotherapy by external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), interstitial brachytherapy (BT) in low-, high- and pulse-dose rate technique, combined EBRT/BT, and intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT). Published evidence is scarce, with altogether ten articles identified, in sum reporting about 310 patients. The vast majority (82%) was treated by brachytherapy. Selection criteria for a second breast conservation attempt were comparable within all reports: all women presented with T0-2 recurrent lesions, late onset after primary treatment (70 months, mean of means) and no evidence of metastatic disease before undergoing gross tumor resection with free surgical margins. Treatment doses were in a similar range for brachytherapy (LDR 30-55 Gy, HDR 30-34 Gy; PDR 40-50 Gy), biologically comparable to the only series exclusively using EBRT (50 Gy). Follow-up times amounted 49 months (mean of the means, range 21-89). Oncologic results were similar among the different methods with local control rates ranging between 76% and 100%, and disease free and overall survival rates comparable to mastectomy series. Acute toxicity was low in all cohorts. All authors reported cosmetic outcome, scoring results from excellent to good in 60-80% of patients, mostly without using standardized evaluation schemes. Major late effects were fibrosis in re-irradiated parenchyma as a function of dose and volume, asymmetry (primarily due to double surgery), and breast pain. There were hardly any G3 and no G4 late reactions noted. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In a highly selected group of patients with IBTR, partial breast irradiation after second BCS is a viable alternative to mastectomy, yielding high breast preservation rates without compromising oncologic safety. Whereas the evidence for brachytherapy is more solid, there is still little information about the effectiveness of PBI via EBRT or novel strategies like IORT, which therefore should preferably be investigated within trials."

Radiobiological advantages of IORT compared to EBRT are higher relative biologic effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy and the presence of high dose in the tumor bed (where the possibility of remaining vital tumor cells is the highest), as this dose reduces rapidly with the distance from the applicator (2). Important feature of IORT alone is that it can be applied as a single fraction during the surgical intervention and spares 3 to 5 weeks of following radiation therapy. This means less time spent in hospital for the patients and for the radiotherapeutical units - reduced waiting lists and more machine time for other patients. Prolonged operative time as well as the need of additional staff are assumed as relative flaws of IORT (3). The INTRABEAM(R) system (Carl Zeiss Surgical Gmbh, Oberkochen, Germany) uses a single high dose of low-energy X-rays (mas 50kV), applied to the tumor bed immediately after the surgical excision of the tumor. These rays have high degree of absorption and low penetrating ability. This determines their advantage in comparison to EBRT to protect the surrounding healthy tissues (2). The data from the Targeted Intraoperative radioTherapy (TARGIT-A) and the Intraoperative radiotherapy versus external radiotherapy for early breast cancer (ELIOT): a randomized controlled equivalence trial show that when following the recommendations of The Groupe Europeen de Curietherapie-European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) Breast Cancer Working Group (2009) for an accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), IORT can be used as an equivalent of the postoperative radiotherapy (1,4,5,6). The purpose of this article is to show the results of the performed on 15 December 2015 for the first time in Bulgaria breast conserving surgery with intraoperative radiotherapy on a patient with early breast cancer."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 52 patients having lung (62 %), breast (17 %), colorectal (8 %) and other cancers (13 %) with one to three brain metastases were treated with 5 non-coplanar VMAT arcs. The treatment dose varied from 12 to 20 Gy, administered in one single session. The volume of metastases ranged from 0.04 to 24.92 cc. Radiosurgery alone was used for 54 % of cases, while 19 % received whole brain radiotherapy due to relapse. Patients were classified according to the Disease-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) index and survival was assessed via the Kaplan-Meier model. RESULTS: The median survival time was 7.2 months from the date of radiosurgery. The Karnofsky and DS-GPA indices were the most significant with regard to survival. Patients with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) over 70 had a longer survival time of 9.2 months, as opposed to those with a KPS below 70 of 3.5 months. No significant differences were found with regard to the type of cancer or the number of lesions. Local tumour control was achieved for 42 metastases (82 %), of which a complete response was achieved for 7 lesions, a partial response for 21; 15 lesions were stabilized. Local progression was observed in 8 lesions (15 %). The median treatment time per patient was 29 min. CONCLUSIONS: The VMAT technique proves to be safe and effective for treating brain metastases via radiosurgery."

The following is a case of a 64-year-old woman with early-stage breast cancer treated with PBI who failed regionally in the ipsilateral axilla. With our dosimetric analysis, we found that the entire area of this axillary failure would have likely received at least 45 Gy if WBRT had been used, enough to sterilize microscopic disease. With PBI, this area received a mean dose of only 2.8 Gy, which raises the possibility that this regional failure may have been prevented had WBRT been used instead of PBI."

While recently published data suggest a potential for an increase in cardiac events with radiotherapy, these studies do not consider the impact of newer radiotherapy techniques commonly utilized. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to evaluate cardiac dose sparing techniques in breast cancer radiotherapy. Current options for cardiac protection/avoidance include (1) maneuvers that displace the heart from the field such as coordinating the breathing cycle or through prone patient positioning, (2) technological advances such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or proton beam therapy (PBT), and (3) techniques that treat a smaller volume around the lumpectomy cavity such as accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), or intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT). While these techniques have shown promise dosimetrically, limited data on late cardiac events exist due to the difficulties of long-term follow up. Future studies are required to validate the efficacy of cardiac dose sparing techniques and may use surrogates for cardiac events such as biomarkers or perfusion imaging."

Three physicians categorized the seroma cavity according to cavity visualization score criteria and delineated each of the 22 seroma cavities and the clinical target volume. Distance between centers of mass, percentage overlap, and average surface distance for all patients were assessed. RESULTS: The mean seroma volume was 36.9 cm(3) and 34.2 cm(3) for fiducial patients and non-fiducial patients, respectively (p = ns). Fiducial markers improved the mean cavity visualization score, to 3.6 +/- 1.0 from 2.5 +/- 1.3 (p < 0.05). The mean distance between centers of mass, average surface distance, and percentage overlap for the seroma and clinical target volume were significantly improved in the fiducial marker patients as compared with the non-fiducial marker patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The placement of gold fiducial markers placed at the time of lumpectomy improves interphysician identification and delineation of the seroma cavity and clinical target volume.

The purpose of this study was to examine dosimetric endpoints in patients with superficial versus full-thickness closures with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). METHODS: Patients who underwent breast conservation surgery followed by 3D conformal external-beam APBI were identified (n = 45) and were separated according to the type of cavity closure performed: superficial and full thickness. Data gathered from the retrospective review of patient charts was analyzed according to criteria in the NSABP B-39 protocol in order to quantify the amount of radiation delivered to organs at risk. The patient seroma cavity was further given a cavity visualization score to assess the impact of wound closure on treatment planning. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean CVS score for the 2 groups. There were no statistical differences in all dosimetric endpoints compared for the 2 types of closure, and both groups met NSABP B-39 guidelines for the ipsilateral breast, heart, and ipsilateral lung dosimetry. CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant difference in dosimetric outcomes in either the superficial or deep closure treatment groups. Breast surgeons should not alter their preferred closure strategy in anticipation of 3D-CRT APBI."

C-ARC, like VMAT, uses a modulated beam aperture and dose rate, but with the couch, not the gantry, rotating. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients previously treated with APBI using 3D-CRT were replanned with (1) C-ARC, (2) IMRT, and (3) VMAT. C-ARC plans were designed with one medial and one lateral arc through which the couch rotated while the gantry was held stationary at a tangent angle. Target dose coverage was normalized to the 3D-CRT plan. Comparative endpoints were dose to normal breast tissue, lungs, and heart and monitor units prescribed. RESULTS: Compared with 3D-CRT, C-ARC, IMRT, and VMAT all significantly reduced the ipsilateral breast V50% by the same amount (mean, 7.8%). Only C-ARC and IMRT plans significantly reduced the contralateral breast maximum dose, the ipsilateral lung V5Gy, and the heart V5%. C-ARC used on average 40%, 30%, and 10% fewer monitor units compared with 3D-CRT, IMRT, and VMAT, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: C-ARC provides improved dosimetry and treatment efficiency, which should reduce the risks of toxicity and secondary malignancy. Its tangent geometry avoids irradiation of critical structures that is unavoidable using the en face geometry of VMAT."

Previous studies have argued that the CTVs generated by these different margins are effectively equivalent. In this study, we use deformable registration to assess the effective CTV treated by balloon brachytherapy on clinically representative 3D-CRT planning images. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients previously treated with the MammoSite were studied. Each patient had two computed tomography (CT) scans, one acquired before and one after balloon implantation. In-house deformable registration software was used to deform the MammoSite CTV onto the balloonless CT set. The deformed CTV was validated using anatomical landmarks common to both CT scans. RESULTS: The effective CTV treated by the MammoSite was on average 7% +/- 10% larger and 38% +/- 4% smaller than 3D-CRT CTVs created using uniform expansions of 1 and 1.5 cm, respectively. The average effective CTV margin was 1.0 cm, the same as the actual MammoSite CTV margin. However, the effective CTV margin was nonuniform and could range from 5 to 15 mm in any given direction. Effective margins <1 cm were attributable to poor cavity-balloon conformance. Balloon size relative to the cavity did not significantly correlate with the effective margin. CONCLUSION: In this study, the 1.0-cm MammoSite CTV margin treated an effective volume that was significantly smaller than the 3D-CRT CTV based on a 1.5-cm margin."

However, implementation of this treatment strategy has been hampered by inaccurate solution space modeling, limited automated beam selection methods, the lack of efficient beam sequencing program and integrated collision prevention. The aim is to develop a 4pi radiotherapy paradigm that takes full advantage of modern computer-controlled robotic C-arm linear accelerators. METHODS: The beam geometry solution space was modeled by 3D surface scanning of the couch, gantry and patient. In order to utilize the entire solution space and optimize MLC resolution, variable source-to-tumor distances were introduced. Conformai radiation doses were computed using convolution/superposition from uniformly distributed solid angles. Beam orientation optimization was performed using a column generation and pricing approach, which was also used to optimize beam fluence intensity modulation. A level set method was then employed to automatically sequence beams so the treatment time and couch motion can be minimized while avoiding collision on the path. RESULTS: The machine and patient surface was accurately measured and a cocoon shaped solution space was created with an integrated gap buffer of 4 cm. 14 conformai beams were typically selected to maximize target dose coverage and minimize critical organ doses. Compared with manual non-coplanar and coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy plans, an average 20% improvement was observed in high dose spillage, defined as the 50% isodose volume divided by the target volume, in a wide range of clinical cases including brain, lung, liver and partial breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We have established a framework that overcomes major technical difficulties associated with automated planning and delivery of highly non-coplanar treatment on the widely available C-arm linacs. Compared with coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy plans, 4pi plans improve nearly all aspects of the dosimetry while remain highly deliverable."

However, partial shielding does not fully explore the potential of IMBT. The goal of this study is to introduce the concept of three dimensional (3D) intensity modulated brachytherapy and solve two fundamental issues regarding the application of 3D IMBT treatment planning: The dose calculation algorithm and the inverse treatment planning method. METHODS: A 3D IMBT treatment planning system prototype was developed using the MATLAB platform. This system consists of three major components: (1) A comprehensive IMBT source calibration method with dosimetric inputs from Monte Carlo (EGSnrc) simulations; (2) a modified TG-43"" (mTG-43) dose calculation formalism for IMBT dosimetry; and (3) a physical constraint based inverse IMBT treatment planning platform utilizing a simulated annealing optimization algorithm. The model S700 Axxent electronic brachytherapy source developed by Xoft, Inc. (Fremont, CA), was simulated in this application. Ten intracavitary accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) cases were studied. For each case, an ""isotropic plan"" with only optimized source dwell time and a fully optimized IMBT plan were generated and compared to the original plan in various dosimetric aspects, such as the plan quality, planning, and delivery time. The issue of the mechanical complexity of the IMBT applicator is not addressed in this study. RESULTS: IMBT approaches showed superior plan quality compared to the original plans and tht isotropic plans to different extents in all studied cases. An extremely difficult case with a small breast and a small distance to the ribs and skin, the IMBT plan minimized the high dose volume V200 by 16.1% and 4.8%, respectively, compared to the original and the isotropic plans. The conformity index for the target was increased by 0.13 and 0.04, respectively. The maximum dose to the skin was reduced by 56 and 28 cGy, respectively, per fraction. Also, the maximum dose to the ribs was reduced by 104 and 96 cGy, respectively, per fraction. The mean dose to the ipsilateral and contralateral breasts and lungs were also slightly reduced by the IMBT plan. The limitations of IMBT are the longer planning and delivery time. The IMBT plan took around 2 h to optimize, while the isotropic plan optimization could reach the global minimum within 5 min. The delivery time for the IMBT plan is typically four to six times longer than the corresponding isotropic plan. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a dosimetry method for IMBT sources was proposed and an inverse treatment planning system prototype for IMBT was developed. The improvement of plan quality by 3D IMBT was demonstrated using ten APBI case studies. Faster computers and higher output of the source can further reduce plan optimization and delivery time, respectively."""

The ELIOT Trial used electrons (IOERT), and the TARGIT-A Trial Update used 50-kV X-rays (IORT). These studies were compared for similarities and differences. The results were analyzed and used to determine which patients might be suitable for single-dose treatment. METHOD: The primary sources of data were the ELIOT Trial and TARGIT-A Trial, as well as a comprehensive analysis of the peer-reviewed literature of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) using 50-kV X-rays or electrons. Studies published or presented prior to March 2014 were analyzed for efficacy, patient restrictions, complications, and outcome. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 5.8 years, the 5-year recurrence rates for ELIOT versus external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) patients were 4.4 % and 0.4 %, respectively, p = .0001. A low-risk ELIOT group was identified with a 5-year recurrence rate of 1.5 %. With a median follow-up of 29 months, the 5-year recurrence rates for the TARGIT-A versus EBRT patients were 3.3 % and 1.3 %, respectively, p = .042. CONCLUSION: With 5.8 years of median follow-up, IOERT appears to have a subset of low-risk women for whom IOERT is acceptable. With 29 months of median follow-up the results of IORT with 50-kV devices are promising, but longer follow-up data are required. At the current time, single-fraction IOERT or IORT patients should be treated under strict institutional protocols."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The novel technology used in this study is a mammography-based, noninvasive breast brachytherapy system whereby the treatment applicators are centered on the planning target volume (PTV) to direct (192)Ir emissions along orthogonal axes. To date, three-dimensional dose modeling of NIIGBB has not been possible because of the limitations of conventional treatment planning systems (TPS) to model variable tissue deformation associated with breast compression. In this study, the TPS was adapted such that the NIIGBB dose distributions were modeled as a virtual point source. This dose calculation technique was applied to CT data from 8 patients imaged with the breast compressed between parallel plates in the cranial-caudal and medial-lateral axes. A dose-volume comparison was performed to simulated electron boost and 3DCRT APBI. RESULTS: The NIIGBB PTV was significantly reduced as compared with both electrons and 3DCRT. Electron boost plans had a lower D(min) than the NIIGBB technique but higher V(100), D(90), and D(50). With regard to PTV coverage for APBI, the only significant differences were minimally higher D(90), D(100), V(80), and V(90), with 3DCRT and D(max) with NIIGBB. The NIIGBB technique, as compared with electrons and 3D-CRT, achieved a lower maximum dose to skin (60% and 10%, respectively) and chest wall/lung (70-90%). CONCLUSIONS: NIIGBB achieves a PTV that is smaller than electron beam and 3DCRT techniques. This results in significant normal tissue sparing while maintaining dosimetric benchmarks to the target tissue."
"J.C. Skowronek, A.",2014,Brachytherapy in breast cancer: an effective alternative,Apbi boost brachytherapy breast cancer recurrence,0,111,eng,"Breast conserving surgery (BCS) with following external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) of the conserved breast has become widely accepted in the last decades for the treatment of early invasive breast cancer. The standard technique of EBRT after BCS is to treat the whole breast up to a total dose of 42.5 to 50 Gy. An additional dose is given to treated volume as a boost to a portion of the breast. In the early stage of breast cancer, research has shown that the area requiring radiation treatment to prevent the cancer from local recurrence is the breast tissue that surrounds the area where the initial cancer was removed. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is an approach that treats only the lumpectomy bed plus a 1-2 cm margin rather than the whole breast and as a result allows accelerated delivery of the radiation dose in four to five days. There has been a growing interest for APBI and various approaches have been developed under phase I-III clinical studies; these include multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, balloon catheter brachytherapy, conformal external beam radiation therapy (3D-EBRT) and intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT). Balloon-based brachytherapy approaches include MammoSite, Axxent electronic brachytherapy, Contura, hybrid brachytherapy devices. Another indication for breast brachytherapy is reirradiation of local recurrence after mastectomy. Published results of brachytherapy are very promising. We discuss the current status, indications, and technical aspects of breast cancer brachytherapy."

From March 2002 to July 2004 25 patients were prospectively included in this study. Six patients were excluded becuase of definitive histology of lobular carcinoma or positive margin. The median age was 63.2 years (range: 44-77 years). Median follow-up of all patients is 11 months (range: 3-25 months) with a minimum follow-up of 3 months. Radiation was delivered using the high-dose-rate remote afterloader VariSource with [192]Ir source. The patients received radiation twice a day at least 6 hours apart for a total of 10 fractions over five days with a single dose of 3.4 Gy. The total dose was 34.0 Gy prescribed as a minimum peripheral dose to match or minimally exceed the volume defined by the surgical clips as seen on CT scans. Freehand technique allows conformal placement of the catheters to the shape of the lumpectomy cavity. We use the method of geometric optimalisation which allows the calculations of dose distribution in relation to target. At a median follow-up of 11 months none of patients developed in-field breast recurrences, one patient had out-of-field recurrences. There were no regional nodal recurrences. At each patient, there was calculated target volume size in cm3 (median 91.3 cm3) dose volume histogram (DVH), dose homogenity index (DHI). Median DHI was 0.42. Median volume of breast tissue getting 100% of the prescription dose, V(100), is 87%; and V(150) 48.5%. We have noticed two treatment complications: hematoma and abscess in the place of tumorous bed after exstirpation. At last follow-up, patients rated the overall cosmetic outcome excellent. This method is suitable just for patients with histologically confirmed small tumors (<3 cm in diameter) without negative prognostic factors for local recurrence (age at least 40 years, negative surgical margins, nodal involvement - maximum three positive nodes without extracapsular extension)."

It is currently used in the community setting, although its efficacy has yet to be validated in prospective comparative trials. Frequency and factors influencing use have not been previously identified.

Brachytherapy use was also more likely in women with non-health maintenance organization insurance (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.64) and in areas with higher median income (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.38), lower density of radiation oncologists (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.86), or higher density of surgeons (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.31). CONCLUSION: Despite ongoing questions regarding efficacy, breast brachytherapy was rapidly incorporated into the care of older, insured patients. In our era of frequently emerging novel technologies yet growing demands to optimize costs and outcomes, results provide insight into how clinical, policy, and socioeconomic factors influence new technology diffusion into conventional care."

In volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) non-coplanar geometries are generally achieved by applying patient couch rotations to single or multiple full or partial arcs. This paper presents a trajectory optimization method for a non-coplanar technique, dynamic couch rotation during VMAT (DCR-VMAT), which combines ray tracing with a graph search algorithm. Four clinical test cases (partial breast, brain, prostate only, and prostate and pelvic nodes) were used to evaluate the potential OAR sparing for trajectory-optimized DCR-VMAT plans, compared with standard coplanar VMAT. In each case, ray tracing was performed and a cost map reflecting the number of OAR voxels intersected for each potential source position was generated. The least-cost path through the cost map, corresponding to an optimal DCR-VMAT trajectory, was determined using Dijkstra's algorithm. Results show that trajectory optimization can reduce dose to specified OARs for plans otherwise comparable to conventional coplanar VMAT techniques. For the partial breast case, the mean heart dose was reduced by 53%. In the brain case, the maximum lens doses were reduced by 61% (left) and 77% (right) and the globes by 37% (left) and 40% (right). Bowel mean dose was reduced by 15% in the prostate only case. For the prostate and pelvic nodes case, the bowel V50 Gy and V60 Gy were reduced by 9% and 45% respectively. Future work will involve further development of the algorithm and assessment of its performance over a larger number of cases in site-specific cohorts."

At our institution, a novel breast stereotactic radiotherapy device has demonstrated dosimetric distributions similar to those in brachytherapy. This study analyzed comparative dose distributions achieved with the device and intensity-modulated radiation therapy accelerated partial breast irradiation. Nine patients underwent computed tomography simulation in the prone position using device-specific immobilization on an institutional review board-approved protocol. Accelerated partial breast irradiation target volumes (planning target volume_10mm) were created per the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-39 protocol. Additional breast stereotactic radiotherapy volumes using smaller margins (planning target volume_3mm) were created based on improved immobilization. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy and breast stereotactic radiotherapy accelerated partial breast irradiation plans were separately generated for appropriate volumes. Plans were evaluated based on established dosimetric surrogates of poor cosmetic outcomes. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were utilized to contrast volumes of critical structures receiving a percentage of total dose ( Vx). The breast stereotactic radiotherapy device consistently reduced dose to all normal structures with equivalent target coverage. The ipsilateral breast V20-100 was significantly reduced ( P < .05) using planning target volume_10mm, with substantial further reductions when targeting planning target volume_3mm. Doses to the chest wall, ipsilateral lung, and breast skin were also significantly lessened. The breast stereotactic radiotherapy device's uniform dosimetric improvements over intensity-modulated accelerated partial breast irradiation in this series indicate a potential to improve outcomes. Clinical trials investigating this benefit have begun accrual."

Worsened outcomes have been correlated with larger volumes of breast tissue exposed to radiation. A novel breast-specific stereotactic radiotherapy (BSRT) device (BSRTD) has been developed at our institution and has shown promise in delivering highly conformal dose distributions. We compared normal tissue sparing with this device with that achieved with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)-PBI. METHODS: Fifteen women previously treated with breast conservation therapy were enrolled on an institutional review board-approved protocol. Each of them underwent CT simulation in the prone position using the BSRTD-specific immobilization system. Simulated postoperative and preoperative treatment volumes were generated based on surgical bed/clip position. Blinded planners generated IMRT-PBI plans and BSRT plans for each set of volumes. These plans were compared based on clinically validated markers for cosmetic outcome and toxicity using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: The BSRT plans consistently reduced the volumes receiving each of several dose levels (Vx) to breast tissue, the chest wall, the lung, the heart, and the skin in both preoperative and postoperative settings (p < 0.05). Preoperative BSRT yielded particularly dramatic improvements. CONCLUSION: The novel BSRTD has demonstrated significant dosimetric benefits over IMRT-PBI.

FIF forward IMRT was performed on ten patients receiving radiotherapy to the whole breast after conservation surgery. Assuming that breast motion follows a sophisticated cyclic function, the changes in hot and cold region, dose homogeneity index (DHI), and skin dose were examined at different respiration amplitudes of 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm. FIF forward IMRT significantly improved the hot region, DHI, and skin dose, but slightly worsened the cold region, compared to the two wedged tangential technique (TWT). Interestingly, we found that the respiration amplitude affected the DHI and cold region but had no effect on the hot region and skin dose. The DHI was slightly improved at 1 cm of amplitude probably due to the blurring effect, remained unchanged at 2 cm of amplitude, and was worsened at 3 cm of amplitude. FIF forward IMRT significantly increased the cold region at 2 cm and 3 cm of respiration amplitude compared to the TWT. At 3 cm of respiration amplitude, an average cold region of 3.27 cm(3) was observed. In summary, our data indicate that during FIF forward IMRT, respiration movement has an important effect on various endpoints depending on the respiration amplitude of the patient."

METHODS: Eighty-four patients with BCS were selected. The breast, tumor bed, and IMN, including intercostal spaces (ICS) 1 to 3, were contoured. Three plans were generated. The prescription doses for the breast and tumor bed were 50.4 Gy/28 F and 60.2 Gy/28 F, respectively. If there was no tumor bed boost, patient was treated with 50 Gy/25 F for the whole breast only. The IMN was not included in planning target volume. RESULTS: The median mean dose (Dmean) of the IMNtotal (ICS 1-3) was 2740.2 cGy, 2973.9 cGy, and 2951.4 cGy for I-IMRT, F-IMRT, and 3D-CRT, respectively. Differences were not detected between any of the plans. After separating ICS 1 to 3 for further analysis, neither of the Dmean of ICS 1 to 2 was significantly different between the plans. However, for ICS 3, the median Dmean was highest for I-IMRT, and those for 3D-CRT and F-IMRT were not significantly different. After separating the 3 techniques for further analysis, the median Dmean was highest in ICS 3 and lowest in ICS 1 for all the 3 techniques. CONCLUSION: All 3 techniques failed to attain an adequate dose to cure subclinical disease, and there were no significant differences among the 3 techniques. It is risky to avoid IMN irradiation (IMNI) using any of the 3 techniques during whole-breast radiotherapy in women with indications for elective IMNI. However, in era of systematic therapy, whether the incidental dose could meet clinical acquirements needs further follow-up."

In this study, we compared the effectiveness between conventional three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and eComp for whole breast irradiation. 3DCRT and eComp planning techniques were used to generate treatment plans for 60 whole breast patients, respectively. The planning goal was to cover 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) with 95% of the prescription dose while minimizing doses to lung, heart, and skin. Comparing to 3DCRT plans, on the average, eComp treatment planning process was about 7 minutes longer, but resulted in lower lung V20Gy, lower mean skin dose, with similar heart dose. The benefits were more pronounced for larger breast patients. Statistical analyses were performed between critical organ doses and patient anatomic features, i.e., central lung distance (CLD), maximal heart distance (MHD), maximal heart length (MHL) and breast separation (BS) to explore any correlations and planning method selection. It was found that to keep the lung V20Gy lower than 20% and mean skin dose lower than 85% of the prescription dose, eComp was the preferred method for patients with more than 2.3 cm CLD or larger than 22.5 cm BS.

This analysis identifies eligible patients for IORT according to available consensus statements and inclusion criteria of the ongoing TARGIT trials. METHODS: Between 01/03 - 12/09, 1505 breast cancer cases were treated at the breast cancer center at the University Medical Center Mannheim. Complete data sets for age, stage (T, N, and M), histology and hormone receptor status were available in 1108 cases.

RESULTS: Out of the 1108 cases, 379 cases (34.2%) were suitable for IORT as APBI regarding the ESTRO and 175 (15.8%) regarding the ASTRO consensus statements. 82 (7.4%) patients were eligible for the TARGIT E trial, 258 (23.3%) for the TARGIT C trial and 671 (60.6%) for the TARGIT BQR registry. According to the consensus statements of ASTRO (45.1%) and ESTRO (41.4%) about half of the eligible patients were treated with IORT as APBI. From the eligible patients fulfilling the criteria for IORT boost (35%) about one third was eventually treated. CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection for IORT should be restrictive. For IORT as APBI the TARGIT trials are even more restrictive including patients than the ESTRO and ASTRO consensus statements."""

The HiArt system is known to have output variation, typically about +/- 2%, due to the absence of a dose servo system. On the HiArt system, x-ray target replacement is required approximately every 10-12 months due to target degradation. Near the end of target life, the target thins and causes a decrease in the beam energy and a softening of the beam profile at the lateral edges of the beam. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the dosimetric effects of rotational output variation and target degradation by modeling their effects and incorporating them into recalculated treatment plans for three clinical scenarios: Head and neck, partial breast, and prostate. Models were created to emulate both potential sources of error. For output variation, a model was created using a sine function to match the amplitude (+/- 2%), frequency, and phase of the measured rotational output variation data. A second model with a hypothetical variation of +/- 7% was also created to represent the largest variation that could exist without violating the allowable dose window in the delivery system. A measured beam profile near the end of target life was used to create a modified beam profile model for the target degradation. These models were then incorporated into the treatment plan by modifying the leaf opening times in the delivery sinogram. A new beam model was also created to mimic the change in beam energy seen near the end of target life. The plans were then calculated using a research version of the PLANNED ADAPTIVE treatment planning software from TomoTherapy, Inc. Three plans were evaluated in this study: Head and neck, partial breast, and prostate. The D50 of organs at risk, the D95 for planning target volumes (PTVs), and the local dose difference were used to evaluate the changes in the modified treatment plans. Dosimetric effects from rotational variation were found to be low (less than 1%) for a typical variation of +/- 2%. Even using a variation of +/- 7%, DVH values and dose distributions were altered by less than 2% for all scenarios. The dosimetric effects of target degradation were found to be slightly more significant. For a model using data taken just before target failure, dosimetric differences of 2%-4% were observed in the recalculated plans when compared to the original plans. The largest effects (up to 4.5%) were observed for PTVs that were located at deeper depths as seen in the prostate plan. Overall, the recalculated plans show that the dosimetric effects of rotational variation and target degradation are on the order of 1%-4% for helical tomotherapy on the HiART system and do not pose a risk for significant deviations from the original treatment plan."

The purpose of the study was to compare five image guidance techniques with respect to imaging dose and image quality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We chose five types of imaging methods applicable for APBI and measured their dose exposure on four different accelerators (Synergy, TrueBeam, Artiste and CyberKnife). Absorbed dose was measured with ionization chamber in thorax phantom. Besides dose exposure image quality was also compared. RESULTS: The lowest dose exposure was measured with kV-kV planar imaging followed by kV-CBCT, MV-MV pair and MV-CBCT in ascending order. Average phantom dose with kV-kV image pair on CyberKnife was 0.01cGy as the lowest and with MV-CBCT on Artiste was 7.11cGy as the highest. Average dose exposures of MV-MV images with TrueBeam, Synergy and Artiste were 1.18cGy, 2.13cGy and 1.61cGy, respectively, with similar image quality. For the same machines the doses of kV-CT imaging were comparable: 0.65cGy, 0.65cGy and 0.52cGy, with some differences in image quality. MV-CBCT technique resulted in the highest dose and poorest image quality. CONCLUSIONS: In APBI the position of the patient and tumour bed can be verified with many tools. When fiducials are available, often 2D imaging is enough to achieve appropriate positioning and the kV-kV method is recommended. Imaging with 2.5MV can also be a good solution instead of 6MV. Without fiducials 3D images should be acquired and the recommended method is the kV-CBCT."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dosimetric analysis was conducted on patients receiving MammoSite breast brachytherapy following conservative surgery for invasive ductal carcinoma. Cardiac dose was evaluated for patients with left breast tumors with a CT scan encompassing the entire heart. Lung dose was evaluated for patients in whom the entire lung was scanned. The prescription dose of 3400 cGy was 1 cm from the balloon surface. MammoSite dosimetry was compared to simulated WBRT fields with and without radiobiological correction for the effects of dose and fractionation. Dose parameters such as the volume of the structure receiving 10 Gy or more (V10) and the dose received by 20 cc of the structure (D20), were calculated as well as the maximum and mean doses received. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were studied, five had complete lung data and six had left-sided tumors with complete cardiac data. Ipsilateral lung volumes ranged from 925-1380 cc. Cardiac volumes ranged from 337-551 cc. MammoSite resulted in a significantly lower percentage lung V30 and lung and cardiac V20 than the WBRT fields, with and without radiobiological correction.

The rates of local recurrence following PBI with the MammoSite applicator have been low, but there are few published reports and follow-up has been relatively short. The cosmetic outcomes and toxicity of MammoSite PBI are comparable to those seen after multicatheter-based PBI.

METHODS AND MATERIAL: Planning CT scans of 10 women requiring post-mastectomy chest wall radiotherapy were included in the study. A dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions was prescribed. Organs at risk (OARs) delineated were heart, lungs, contralateral breast, and spinal cord. Dose-volume metrics were defined to quantify the quality of concurrent treatment plans assessing target coverage and sparing of OARs. Plans were designed for conformal 3D therapy (3DCRT) or for RapidArc with double partial arcs (RA). RapidArc plans were optimized for both conventional beams as well as for unflattened beams (RAF). The goal for this planning effort was to cover 100% of the planning target volume (PTV) with >/= 90% of the prescribed dose and to minimize the volume inside the PTV receiving > 105% of the dose. The mean ipsilateral lung dose was required to be lower than 15 Gy and V(20 Gy) < 22%. Contralateral organ irradiation was required to be kept as low as possible.

RA plans showed superiority compared to 3DCRT in the medium to high dose region for the ipsilateral lung. Heart irradiation was minimized by RAF plans with ~4.5 Gy and ~15 Gy reduction in maximum dose compared to RA and 3DCRT, respectively. RAF resulted in superior plans compared to RA with respect to contralateral breast and lung with a reduction of ~1.7 Gy and 1.0 Gy in the respective mean doses. CONCLUSION: RapidArc treatment resulted in acceptable plan quality with superior ipsilateral tissue sparing compared to traditional techniques. Flattening filter free beams, recently made available for clinical use, might provide further healthy tissue sparing, particularly in contralateral organs, suggesting their applicability for large and complex targets."

Study Design: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: Thirty plans were generated - VMAT with two partial arcs and field in field tangential 3DCRT plans. Results: In the 3DCRT plans, planning target volume (PTV) dose coverage was 2% higher compared with the VMAT plan 98.21 +/- 1.79 versus 96.30 +/- 2.62 (P = 0.028). The conformity index was better for the 3DCRT plan (0.97 vs. 0.95; P = 0.022), while the homogeneity index was worse for the VMAT plans (0.16 vs. 0.23; P = 0.057). However, the organ at risk sparing was better with the VMAT plans when compared to the 3DCRT plans. This was particularly relevant for the higher doses. The V20 Gy (34.94 vs. 24.42), V30 Gy (32.32 vs. 16.19), and V40 Gy (28.23 vs. 8.03) for the lung were significantly higher for the 3DCRT plans when compared to VMAT plans (P = 0.000). Similarly, the V20 Gy (29.88 vs. 12.79), V30 Gy (27.25 vs. 4.94), and V40 Gy (24.58 vs. 1.47) for the heart was significantly higher for the 3DCRT plans when compared to the VMAT plans (P = 0.000). The V5 Gy for lung (77.86 vs. 47.38) and heart (76.18 vs. 39.36) was significantly higher for the VMAT plans when compared to the 3DCRT plans (P = 0.000). Conclusion: VMAT is dosimetrically superior to the field-in-field 3DCRT for left-sided breast cancer patients owing to its comparable PTV coverage and better sparing of heart and lung."

The gantry angle of 2F-IMRT were 301 degrees -311 degrees and 125 degrees -135 degrees . The prescription dose was 46 Gy/23 fractions. All plans required 95% of the target volume receiving the prescription dose. The dose distribution of the target, organs at risk, machine unit (MU) and treatment time were compared.

Materials and methods: Eighteen patients with breast cancer who underwent breast conserving surgery were selected. For each patient four different whole breast irradiation techniques including Tan, fIMRT, iIMRT and VMAT were compared to the conventional tangential technique (Tan). Results: Mean maximum point dose (Dmax) for Tan, fIMRT, iIMRT and VMAT were 110.17% (+/-1.87), 105.89% (+/-1.13), 106.47% (+/-0.92) and 106.99% (+/-1.16) (p<0.001).

DIBH immobilizes the tumor bed providing dosimetric benefits over free breathing (FB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten left sided post mastectomy patients were immobilized in a supine position with both the arms lifted above the head on a hemi-body vaclock. Two thermoplastic masks were prepared for each patient, one for normal free breathing and a second made with breath-hold to maintain reproducibility. DIBH CT scans were performed in the prospective mode of the Varian real time position management (RPM) system. The planning target volume (PTV) included the left chest wall and supraclavicular nodes and PTV prescription dose was 5000cGy in 25 fractions. DIBH-3DCRT planning was performed with the single iso-centre technique using a 6MV photon beam and the field-in-field technique. VMAT plans for FB and DIBH contained two partial arcs (179o-300oCCW/CW). Dose volume histograms of PTV and OAR's were analyzed for DIBH-VMAT, FB-VMAT and DIBH-3DCRT. In DIBH mode daily orthogonal (0o and 90o) KV images were taken to determine the setup variability and weekly twice CBCT to verify gating threshold level reproducibility. RESULTS: DIBH-VMAT reduced the lung and heart dose compared to FB-VMAT, while maintaining similar PTV coverage. The mean heart V30Gy was 2.3% +/-2.7, 5.1% +/-3.2 and 3.3% +/-7.2 and for left lung V20Gy was 18.57% +/-2.9, 21.7% +/-3.9 and 23.5% +/-5.1 for DIBH-VMAT, FB-VMAT and DIBH-3DCRT respectively. CONCLUSIONS: DIBH-VMAT significantly reduced the heart and lung dose for left side chest wall patients compared to FB-VMAT. PTV conformity index, homogeneity index, ipsilateral lung dose and heart dose were better for DIBH-VMAT compared to DIBH-3DCRT. However, contralateral lung and breast volumes exposed to low doses were increased with DIBH-VMAT."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-three patients with left-sided breast cancer who received postoperative radiation after breast-conserving surgery were studied. For each patient, we generated five IMRT plans including heart (H), left ventricle (LV), AMT, LV+AMT, and H+LV as the primary OARs, respectively, except both lungs and right breast, which corresponded to IMRT(H), IMRT(LV), IMRT(AMT), IMRT(LV+AMT), and IMRT(H+LV). For the planning target volumes and OARs, the parameters of dose-volume histograms were compared. RESULTS: The homogeneity index, conformity index, and coverage index were not compromised significantly in IMRT(AMT), IMRT(LV) and IMRT(LV+ AMT), respectively, when compared with IMRT(H). The mean dose to the heart, LV, and AMT decreased 5.3-21.5% (p < 0.05), 19.9-29.5% (p < 0.05), and 13.3-24.5% (p < 0.05), respectively. Similarly, the low (e.g., V5%), middle (e.g., V20%), and high (e.g., V30%) dose-volume of the heart, LV, and AMT decreased with different levels. The mean dose and V10% of the right lung increased by 9.2% (p < 0.05) and 27.6% (p < 0.05), respectively, in IMRT(LV), and the mean dose and V5% of the right breast decreased significantly in IMRT(AMT) and IMRT(LV+AMT). IMRT(AMT) was the preferred plan and was then compared with IMRT(H+LV); the majority of dose-volume histogram parameters of OARs including the heart, LV, AMT, both lungs, and the right breast were not statistically different. However, the low dose-volume of LV increased and the middle dose-volume decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in IMRT(AMT). Also, those of the right lung (V10%, V15%) and right breast (V5%, V10%) decreased significantly (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The AMT may replace the heart as the OAR in left-sided breast IMRT after breast-conserving surgery to decrease the radiation dose to the heart."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The skin color and moisture changes were examined using a newly installed spectrophotometer and corneometer in 22 patients who had undergone APBI using open cavity implant high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (36 Gy in six fractions) and compared with the corresponding values for 44 patients in an external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) control group (50-60 Gy in 25-30 fractions within 5-6 weeks) after breast conserving surgery. RESULTS: All values changed significantly as a result of APBI. The extent of elevation in a * (reddish) and reduction in L * (black) values caused by APBI were similar to those for EBRT, with slightly delayed recovery for 6-12 months after treatment owing to the surgical procedure. In contrast, only APBI caused a change in the b * values, and EBRT did not, demonstrating that the reduction in b * values (yellowish) depends largely on the surgical procedure. The changes in moisture were less severe after APBI than after EBRT, and the recovery was more rapid. The toxicity assessment using the Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3, showed that all dermatitis caused by APBI was Grade 2 or less. CONCLUSION: An objective analysis can quantify the effects of APBI procedures on color and moisture cosmesis. The radiation dermatitis caused by APBI using the present schedule showed an equivalent effect on skin color and a less severe effect on moisture than the effects caused by standard EBRT."

However, the methods for the FIF technique used in these studies vary. These methods were classified into three categories. We simulated a radiotherapy plan with each method and analyzed the outcomes. In the first method, a pair of subfields was added to each main field: the single pair of subfields method (SSM). In the second method, three pairs of subfields were added to each main field: the multiple pairs of subfields method (MSM). In the third method, subfields were alternately added: the alternate subfields method (ASM). A total of 51 patients were enrolled in this study. The maximum dose to the planning target volume (PTV) (Dmax) and the volumes of the PTV receiving 100% of the prescription dose (V100%) were calculated. The thickness of the breast between the chest wall and skin surface was measured, and patients were divided into two groups according to the median. In the overall series, the average V100% with ASM (60.3%) was significantly higher than with SSM (52.6%) and MSM (48.7%). In the thin breast group as well, the average V100% with ASM (57.3%) and SSM (54.2%) was significantly higher than that with MSM (43.3%). In the thick breast group, the average V100% with ASM (63.4%) was significantly higher than that with SSM (51.0%) and MSM (54.4%).

Use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been proposed to reduce cardiac dose in these patients. We compared cardiac exposure from IMRT delivered from 2 opposed fields and 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) plans employing simple heart blocks. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fourteen patients with left-sided breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and RT were identified to have unfavorable cardiac anatomy, defined as maximum heart depth (MHD) >/=1.0 cm within the unblocked opposed tangential fields. 3DCRT plans utilized dynamic wedges, segments, and custom heart blocks designed by the treating physician. Tangent IMRT plans were optimized to reduce cardiac dose while maintaining planning target volume (PTV) coverage equal to that achieved with the 3DCRT plan. We generated tangential field plans with complete heart block (CHB) or no heart block (NHB) for comparison. Plans were normalized to deliver 46 Gy to the PTV. Dose to the heart, PTV, and lumpectomy cavity were compared. RESULTS: Mean MHD was 1.44 cm (1.0-1.86 cm). There was no significant difference in PTV receiving >95% of the prescription dose between 3DCRT and IMRT, as intended. Mean V30 to the heart was 0% for CHB plans, 1.7% for 3DCRT plans, 1.8% for IMRT plans, and 3.3% for NHB plans, respectively. There was no significant difference in heart V30 for 3DCRT and IMRT plans (P = .8). IMRT plans delivered 256 total monitor units compared with 201 in 3DCRT plans (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Inverse-planned tangent IMRT does not reduce high-dose radiation to the heart compared with 3DCRT, incorporating a simple heart block in women with left-sided cancer and unfavorable cardiac anatomy when PTV coverage was equalized for both plans. In select patients with early-stage breast cancer and unfavorable thoracic anatomy, 3DCRT with heart block may be sufficient to adequately protect the heart from high-dose radiation."

However, it usually involves some radiation exposure of the heart and analyses of randomised trials have shown that it can increase the risk of heart disease. Estimates of the absolute risks of radiation-related heart disease are needed to help oncologists plan each individual woman's treatment. The risk for an individual woman varies according to her estimated cardiac radiation dose and her background risk of ischaemic heart disease in the absence of radiotherapy. When it is known, this risk can then be compared with the absolute benefit of the radiotherapy. At present, many UK cancer centres are already giving radiotherapy with mean heart doses of less than 3 Gy and for most women the benefits of the radiotherapy will probably far outweigh the risks. Technical approaches to minimising heart dose in breast cancer radiotherapy include optimisation of beam angles, use of multileaf collimator shielding, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, treatment in a prone position, treatment in deep inspiration (including the use of breath-hold and gating techniques), proton therapy and partial breast irradiation. The multileaf collimator is suitable for many women with upper pole left breast cancers, but for women with central or lower pole cancers, breath-holding techniques are now recommended in national UK guidelines. Ongoing work aims to identify ways of irradiating pan-regional lymph nodes that are effective, involve minimal exposure of organs at risk and are feasible to plan, deliver and verify. These will probably include wide tangent-based field-in-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy or arc radiotherapy techniques in combination with deep inspiratory breath-hold, and proton beam irradiation for women who have a high predicted heart dose from intensity-modulated radiotherapy."

A patient with pectus excavatum desired breast-conserving therapy for her early stage breast cancer. She underwent lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection followed by chemotherapy. She was then referred for radiotherapy. A breast board (Med-Tec) with aquaplast body cast was used to limit the movement of the patient, chest wall, and breasts before planning a computed tomography (CT) scan. IMRT including dose-volume histogram (DVH) was compared to that of the conventional plan using parallel opposed tangential beams with a 15-degree wedge pair. Forty-five gray was prescribed to the whole breast to each plan, while 50 Gy was prescribed to the tumor bed using IMRT with SMART boost in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. The coverage of the whole breast was adequate for both plans. IMRT allowed a more homogeneous dose distribution within the breast at the desired dose range. With IMRT there is less volume of ipsilateral lung receiving the radiation dose that is above the tolerance threshold of 15 Gy when compared to that of the conventional plan. However, there is more volume of surrounding normal tissues (the heart, spinal cord, and contralateral breast and lung) receiving low-dose irradiation when IMRT was employed. SMART boost was feasible, allowing a mean dose of 57 Gy to be delivered to the tumor bed simultaneously along with the rest of the breast in 5 weeks. IMRT is feasible in treating early breast cancer patients with pectus excavatum by decreasing the ipsilateral lung volume receiving high-dose radiation when compared to the conventional method. SMART boost shortens the overall treatment time that may have potential radiobiological benefit."

This work assesses its impact for local irradiation in terms of side effects, as well as tumour control in locally advanced (LABC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of 66 patients with LABC and MBC. Patients received standard fractionated radiotherapy by HT, with or without concurrent systemic treatment. RESULTS: The median age was 60 years (28-77). The median follow-up of the population was 35.9 months (10.6-95.8). For 91% of patients, HT was concomitant with systemic treatments. Three patients experienced grade 3 skin toxicity and all had concurrent 5FU-vinorelbine. One patient who was receiving concurrent treatment with trastuzumab-pertuzumab had a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction by 14%. No late cardiac or lung toxicity was observed. A clinical benefit was observed in 75% of cases. At 2 months after HT, we observed tumour regression in 7/8 patients, as following: 1 complete, 4 partial responses, and 2 stable disease. The median survival for MBC group was 64.4 months (42.6-65.8) and 21.1 (6.1-36.1) months for LABC. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the use of HT is well tolerated and feasible with a multimodal strategy that includes concurrent systemic treatments for patients with LABC and MBC. Advances in knowledge: The survival of LABC and MBC increases and new safe tools are needed to determine optimal strategies of treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first paper describing the use of HT for this population."

The purpose of this dosimetric study was to clarify whether these results are transferable to superficial targets and to quantify the additional effect of fractionation. A solid polystyrene phantom and an anthropomorphic phantom were used for film and ion chamber dose measurements. The phantoms were installed on an electric driven device and moved with a frequency of 6 or 12 cycles per minute and an amplitude of 4 mm or 10 mm. A split beam geometry of two adjacent asymmetric fields and an IMRT treatment plan with 12 fields for irradiation of the breast were investigated. For the split beam geometry the dose modifications due to unintended superposition of partial fields were reduced by fractionation and completely smoothed out after 20 fractions. IMRT applied to the moving phantom led to a more homogeneous dose distribution compared to the static phantom. The standard deviation of the target dose which is a measure of the dose homogeneity was 10.3 cGy for the static phantom and 7.7 cGy for a 10 mm amplitude. The absolute dose values, measured with ionization chambers, remained unaffected. Irradiation of superficial targets by IMRT in the step-and-shoot technique did not result in unexpected dose perturbations due to breathing motion. We conclude that regular breathing motion does not jeopardize IMRT of superficial target volumes."

We chose 10 patients with left-sided and 10 patients with right-sided tumors. All treatment volumes included the internal mammary chain. For plan comparison to the applied CRT plan an inverse IMRT-plan in, step-and-shoot'-technique was calculated. For all patients IMRT resulted in an improved conformity of dose distribution to the target volume compared to CRT (mean COIN95: 0.798 vs. 0.514 with COIN95 = C1 * C2 (C1= fraction of CTV that is covered by > 95% of the prescribed dose and C2 = volume of CTV that is covered by > 95% of the prescribed dose/total volume that is covered by > 95% of the prescribed dose). In all cases with matching adjacent beams, the homogeneity in the target volume was improved. The volume of the ipsilateral lung irradiated with a dose higher than 20 Gy was reduced with IMRT from 24.6% to 13.1% compared to CRT. For left-sided target volume the heart volume with a dose higher than 30 Gy was reduced from 6.2% to 0.2%. The presented plan comparison study for irradiation of the breast and the parasternal lymph nodes showed a substantial improvement of the dose distribution by inversely planned IMRT compared to CRT. This is visible for the target volume, the ipsilateral lung and, in case of left-sided target volume, the heart. Despite an increase in integral dose to the entire normal tissue, the application of IMRT might be clinically advantageous in cases where no satisfying dose distribution can be obtained by CRT."

Due to a pronounced funnel chest no satisfying dose distribution was obtained by conventional techniques. Thus an intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) based on inverse optimisation was carried out. IMRT was compared to conventional techniques regarding dose distribution and feasibility. PATIENT AND METHODS: Tumor site was in the right middle lower quadrant. Target volume included the right breast and the parasternal lymph nodes. Target dose was 50.4 Gy. Based on inverse optimisation irradiation was carried out in step-and-shoot""-technique with twelve intensity modulated beams with six intensity steps. Additionally, treatment plans were calculated using conventional techniques (technique A with two tangential wedged 6-MV photon beams, technique B with additional oblique 15-MeV electron portal). We analysed conformality and homogeneity of target volume and dose distribution within normal tissue. RESULTS: Dose conformality was substantially improved by IMRT. Dose homogeneity was slightly decreased compared to technique A. Lung volume irradiated with a dose higher than 20 Gy was reduced from 56.8% with technique A and 40.1% with technique B, respectively to 22.1% with IMRT. Treatment was tolerated well by the patient without relevant side effects. Mean treatment time was 19.5 min. CONCLUSION: The inversely planned IMRT using multiple beam directions is suitable for breast irradiation following breast conserving surgery. In the present case of a woman with funnel chest lung dose was substantially reduced without reduction of target dose.

The aim of this study is to apply skin normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) optimization in left-side BC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten left-side BC patients undergoing photon irradiation after breast-conserving surgery were randomly selected from our clinical database. Intensity modulated photon (IMRT) and IMPT plans were calculated with iso-tumor-coverage criteria and according to RTOG 1005 guidelines. Proton plans were computed with and without skin optimization. Published NTCP models were employed to estimate the risk of different toxicity endpoints for skin, lung, heart and its substructures. RESULTS: Acute skin NTCP evaluation suggests a lower toxicity level with IMPT compared to IMRT when the skin is included in proton optimization strategy (0.1% versus 1.7%, p < 0.001). Dosimetric results show that, with the same level of tumor coverage, IMPT attains significant heart and lung dose sparing compared with IMRT. By NTCP model-based analysis, an overall reduction in the cardiopulmonary toxicity risk prediction can be observed for all IMPT compared to IMRT plans: the relative risk reduction from protons varies between 0.1 and 0.7 depending on the considered toxicity endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that IMPT might be safely applied without increasing the risk of severe acute radiation induced skin toxicity. The quantitative risk estimates also support the potential clinical benefits of IMPT for left-side BC irradiation due to lower risk of cardiac and pulmonary morbidity. The applied approach might be relevant on the long term for the setup of cost-effectiveness evaluation strategies based on NTCP predictions."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Planning CTs of 14 women with deep-seated tumors (i.e., > or =4 cm depth) were selected. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as the area of architectural distortion surrounded by surgical clips. The planning treatment volume (PTV) was the CTV plus 1cm margin. A dose of 16 Gy in 2 Gy fractions was prescribed. Organs at risk (OARs) were heart, lungs, breasts, and a 5-mm thick skin segment on the breast surface. Dose-volume metrics were defined to quantify the quality of concurrent treatment plans assessing target coverage and sparing of OAR. The following treatment techniques were assessed: photon beams with either static 3D-conformal, dynamic arc (DCA), static gantry intensity-modulated beams (IMRT), or RapidArc (RA); a single conformal EB; and intensity-modulated proton beams (IMPT). The goal for this planning effort was to cover 100% of the CTV with 95% of the prescribed dose and to minimize the volume inside the CTV receiving >107% of the dose. RESULTS: All techniques but DCA and EB achieved the planning objective for the CTV with an inhomogeneity ranging from 2% to 11%. RA showed the best conformity, EB the worst. Contra-lateral breast and lung were spared by all techniques with mean doses <0.5 Gy (zero for protons). The ipsi-lateral lung received a mean dose <10% of that prescribed with photon beams and <2% with IMPT, increasing to 17% with EB. The heart, in left-sided breast tumors, received also the highest dose with EB. The skin was best protected with RA with a mean dose of 5.4 Gy and V(15Gy)=2.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Boosting the tumor bed in early-stage breast cancer with optimized photon or proton beams may be preferred to EB especially for deep-seated targets. The marked OAR (i.e., ipsi-lateral breast, lung, heart, and skin surface) dose-sparing effect may allow for a potential long-term toxicity risk reduction and better cosmesis. DCA or RA may also be considered alternative treatment options for patients eligible for accelerated partial breast irradiation trials."

Between 02/2004 and 03/2006, 96 patients were treated with one to two additional low-weighted PVSeg to reduce dose peaks within the target volume. 169 patients treated between 01/2000 and 12/2001 before implementation of this PVSeg technique served as comparison group.

RESULTS: : The mean PTV was 1,144 ml (range, 235-2,365 ml). Moist skin desquamations developed in 16 patients (17%) with PVSeg compared to 30 patients (18%) without PVSeg (p = 0.482). In breast volumes > 1,100 ml, the corresponding figures were 19% versus 29% (p = 0.133). V(105%) was significantly reduced by the use of PVSeg (82 +/- 51 ml vs. 143 +/- 129 ml; p < 0.0001).

A prospective institutional review board-approved study included 26 patients undergoing breast RT: 20 whole breast irradiation (WBI) patients and six partial breast irradiation (PBI) patients, with surgical clips outlining the LC. The patients underwent CT simulation (CTsim) followed by five CBCTs during RT, once daily for PBI and once weekly for WBI. The distance between surgical clips and their centroid (D) acted as a surrogate for LC size. The RoC of the LC size, defined as the percentage change of D between two scans divided by the time interval in days between the scans, was calculated before (CTsim to CBCT1) and during RT (CBCT1 to CBCT5). The mean RoC of D for all patients before starting RT was -0.25%/day (range, -1.3 to 1.4) and for WBI patients during RT was -0.15%/day (range, -0.45 to 0.40). Stratified by median CTVLC, the RoC before RT for large CTVLC group (>/= 25.7 cc) was 15 times higher (-0.47%/day) than for small CTVLC group (&lt; 25.7 cc) (-0.03%/day), p = 0.06.

METHODS: The planning system (called CARMEN) is a full MC-TPS, controlled through aMATLAB interface, which is based on the sequencing of a novel map, called biophysical"" map, which is generated from enhanced image data of patients to achieve a set of segments actually deliverable. In order to reduce the required computation time, the conventional fluence map has been replaced by the biophysical map which is sequenced to provide direct apertures that will later be weighted by means of an optimization algorithm based on linear programming. A ray-casting algorithm throughout the patient CT assembles information about the found structures, the mass thickness crossed, as well as PET values. Data are recorded to generate a biophysical map for each gantry angle. These maps are the input files for a home-made sequencer developed to take into account the interactions of photons and electrons with the MLC. For each linac (Axesse of Elekta and Primus of Siemens) and energy beam studied (6, 9, 12, 15 MeV and 6 MV), phase space files were simulated with the EGSnrc/BEAMnrc code. The dose calculation in patient was carried out with the BEAMDOSE code. This code is a modified version of EGSnrc/DOSXYZnrc able to calculate the beamlet dose in order to combine them with different weights during the optimization process. RESULTS: Three complex radiotherapy treatments were selected to check the reliability of CARMEN in situations where the MC calculation can offer an added value: A head-and-neck case (Case I) with three targets delineated on PET/CT images and a demanding dose-escalation; a partial breast irradiation case (Case II) solved with photon and electron modulated beams (IMRT + MERT); and a prostatic bed case (Case III) with a pronounced concave-shaped PTV by using volumetric modulated arc therapy. In the three cases, the required target prescription doses and constraints on organs at risk were fulfilled in a short enough time to allow routine clinical implementation. The quality assurance protocol followed to check CARMEN system showed a high agreement with the experimental measurements. CONCLUSIONS: A Monte Carlo treatment planning model exclusively based on maps performed from patient imaging data has been presented. The sequencing of these maps allows obtaining deliverable apertures which are weighted for modulation under a linear programming formulation. The model is able to solve complex radiotherapy treatments with high accuracy in an efficient computation time."""

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 3D-CRT-SIB and various IMRT-SIB treatment plans were constructed and optimised for 30 patients with early stage left-sided breast cancer. Coverage of planning target volumes (PTVs) and dose delivered to organs at risk (OARs) were determined for each plan. Overlap between heart and breast PTV (OHB), size of breast and boost PTVs and boost location were examined in their ability to identify patients that might benefit from IMRT-SIB. RESULTS: All plans had adequate PTV coverage. IMRT-SIB generally reduced dose levels delivered to heart, lungs, and normal breast tissue relative to 3D-CRT-SIB. However, IMRT-SIB benefit differed per patient. For many patients, comparable results were obtained with 3D-CRT-SIB, while patients with OHB>1.4 cm and a relatively large boost PTV volume (>125 cm(3)) gained most from the use of IMRT-SIB. CONCLUSIONS: In breast-conserving RT, results obtained with 3D-CRT-SIB and IMRT-SIB are generally comparable. Patient characteristics could be used to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from IMRT-SIB."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 19 patients (one computed tomography scan and five cone beam computed tomography scans each), three treatment plans were made (wedge, simple intensity-modulated RT [IMRT], and full IMRT). For each treatment plan, four dose distributions were calculated. The first dose distribution was the original plan. The other three included the effects of patient setup errors (rigid displacement of the bony anatomy) or breast errors (e.g., rotations and shape changes of the breast with respect to the bony anatomy), or both, and were obtained through deformable image registration and dose accumulation. Subsequently, the effects of the plan type and error sources on target volume coverage, mean lung dose, and excess dose were determined. RESULTS: Systematic errors of 1-2 mm and random errors of 2-3 mm (standard deviation) were observed for both patient- and breast-related errors. Planning techniques involving glancing fields (wedge and simple IMRT) were primarily affected by patient errors ( approximately 6% loss of coverage near the dorsal field edge and approximately 2% near the skin). In contrast, plan deterioration due to breast errors was primarily observed in planning techniques without glancing fields (full IMRT, approximately 2% loss of coverage near the dorsal field edge and approximately 4% near the skin). CONCLUSION: The influences of patient and breast errors on the dose distributions are comparable in magnitude for whole breast RT plans, including glancing open fields, rendering simple IMRT the preferred technique. Dose distributions from planning techniques without glancing open fields were more seriously affected by shape changes of the breast, demanding specific attention in partial breast planning techniques."

Addition of a boost dose to the initial tumor area further reduces local recurrences. We investigated the dosimetric benefits of a simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) compared to a sequential boost to hypofractionate the boost volume, while maintaining normofractionation on the breast. METHODS: For 10 patients 4 treatment plans were deployed, 1 with a sequential photon boost, and 3 with different SIB techniques: on a conventional linear accelerator, helical TomoTherapy, and static TomoDirect. Dosimetric comparison was performed. RESULTS: PTV-coverage was good in all techniques. Conformity was better with all SIB techniques compared to sequential boost (P = 0.0001). There was less dose spilling to the ipsilateral breast outside the PTVboost (P = 0.04). The dose to the organs at risk (OAR) was not influenced by SIB compared to sequential boost. Helical TomoTherapy showed a higher mean dose to the contralateral breast, but less than 5 Gy for each patient. CONCLUSIONS: SIB showed less dose spilling within the breast and equal dose to OAR compared to sequential boost. Both helical TomoTherapy and the conventional technique delivered acceptable dosimetry. SIB seems a safe alternative and can be implemented in clinical routine."

RESULTS: The Vero system achieved an excellent PTV-coverage and at the same time could minimize the dose to the organs at risk with an average near-maximum-dose (D2) to the heart of 0.9 Gy and the average volume of ipsilateral lung receiving 5 Gy (V5) of 1.5%. The TomoTherapy modalities delivered an average D2 to the heart of 0.9 Gy for the rotational and of 2.3 Gy for the static modality and an average V5 to the ipsilateral lung of 7.3% and 2.9% respectively. A rotational technique offers an adequate conformity at the cost of more low dose spread and a larger build-up area. In most cases a 2-field technique showed acceptable PTV-coverage, but a bad conformity. Electrons often delivered a worse PTV-coverage than photons, with the planning requirements achieved only in 2 patients and with an average D2 to the heart of 2.8 Gy and an average V5 to the ipsilateral lung of 5.8%.

We aimed to investigate the elective radiation dose at the sentinel lymph node (SLN) site while evaluating two techniques for SLN localization, in breast cancer patients treated with lumpectomy and three-dimensional (3D) whole-breast radiotherapy. METHODS: The SLN site of consecutive Tis-2N0 breast cancer patients undergoing lumpectomy and forward intensity-modulated whole-breast radiotherapy was determined by the location of the hotspot on preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) and by a surgical clip placed at the removed SLN(s) during SLNB. The radiation dose at the SLN site was subsequently determined on the postoperative radiotherapy planning CT. An elective radiation dose to the SLN site was defined as at least 95 % of the breast dose. RESULTS: Of the 42 included patients, the mean percentage of the breast dose on the SLN site was 90 % (standard deviation 26, range 7-132, median 99), with a non-significant difference between the two techniques (surgical clip or SPECT/CT) (p = 0.608).

We measured the heart distance respective to the cardiothoracic ratio and the distance of the inferior field border to diaphragm, as well as the breast volume in correlation with the irradiated heart volume. RESULTS: The mean heart and left breast volumes were 504 cm(3) and 672.8 cm(3), respectively.

Setup precision was monitored using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging. Respiration-related breast movement in the vertical direction was assessed by magnetic sensors. The time needed for patient setup and for the CBCT procedure, the beam time, and the length of the whole treatment slot were also recorded. RESULTS: Random and systematic errors were not significantly different between positions in individual patients for each of the three axes (left-right, longitudinal, and vertical). Respiration-related movement was smaller in prone position, but about 80% of observations showed amplitudes <1 mm in both positions. Treatment slots were longer in prone position (21.2 +/- 2.5 min) than in supine position (19.4 +/- 0.8 min; p = 0.044). CONCLUSION: Comparison of setup precision between prone and supine position in the same patient showed no significant differences in random and systematic errors. Respiratory movement was smaller in prone position. The longer treatment slots in prone position can probably be attributed to the higher repositioning need."

However, few breast cancer trials comparing adjuvant conventional radiotherapy (CR) and hypofractionated tomotherapy (TT) have investigated HRQOL. We compared HRQOL in stage I-II breast cancer patients who were randomized to receive either CR or TT. Tomotherapy uses an integrated computed tomography scanner to improve treatment accuracy, aiming to reduce the adverse effects of radiotherapy. METHODS: A total of 121 stage I-II breast cancer patients who had undergone breast conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy (MA) were randomly assigned to receive either CR or TT. CR patients received 25 x 2 Gy over 5 weeks, and BCS patients also received a sequential boost of 8 x 2 Gy over 2 weeks. TT patients received 15 x 2.8 Gy over 3 weeks, and BCS patients also received a simultaneous integrated boost of 15 x 0.6 Gy over 3 weeks. Patients completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 questionnaires. The mean score (+/- standard error) was calculated at baseline, the end of radiotherapy, and at 3 months and 1, 2, and 3 years post-radiotherapy. Data were analyzed by the 'intention-to-treat' principle. RESULTS: On the last day of radiotherapy, patients in both treatment arms had decreased global health status and functioning scores; increased fatigue (clinically meaningful in both treatment arms), nausea and vomiting, and constipation; decreased arm symptoms; clinically meaningful increased breast symptoms in CR patients and systemic side effects in TT patients; and slightly decreased body image and future perspective. At 3 months post-radiotherapy, TT patients had a clinically significant increase in role- and social-functioning scores and a clinically significant decrease in fatigue. The post-radiotherapy physical-, cognitive- and emotional-functioning scores improved faster in TT patients than CR patients. TT patients also had a better long-term recovery from fatigue than CR patients. ANOVA with the Bonferroni correction did not show any significant differences between groups in HRQOL scores. CONCLUSIONS: TT patients had a better improvement in global health status and role- and cognitive-functioning, and a faster recovery from fatigue, than CR patients. These results suggest that a shorter fractionation schedule may reduce the adverse effects of treatment."

Reproducibility, as measured by technical feasibility, was the primary end point with the goal of demonstrating whether the technique is widely applicable in a multicenter setting before a Phase III trial is undertaken. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study was designed such that if fewer than 5 cases out of the first 42 patients evaluable were scored as unacceptable, the treatment would be considered reproducible. Patients received 38.5 Gy in 3.85 Gy/fraction delivered twice daily. The clinical target volume included the lumpectomy cavity plus a 10-15-mm margin bounded by 5 mm within the skin surface and the lung-chest wall interface. The planning target volume (PTV) included the clinical target volume plus a 10-mm margin. Treatment plans were judged as follows: (1) No variations (total coverage), 95% isodose surface covers 100% of the PTV and all specified critical normal tissue dose-volume histogram (DVH) limits met. (2) Minor variation (marginal coverage), 95% isodose surface covers between > or = 95% and <100% of the PTV. No portion of PTV receives <93% of prescription (isocenter) dose. All specified critical normal tissue DVH limits fall within 5% of the guidelines. (3) Major variation (miss), 95% isodose surface covers <95% of the PTV. Portion of PTV receives <93% of prescription isocenter dose. Any critical normal tissue DVH limit exceeds 5% of the specified value. RESULTS: A total of 58 patients were enrolled on this study between 8/15/03 and 4/30/04, 5 of whom were ineligible or did not receive protocol treatment. Two additional patients were excluded, one because the on-study form was not submitted, and the other because no treatment planning material was submitted. This primary end point analysis is based on the first 42 (out of 51) evaluable patients, which were accrued from 17 different institutions (31 centers were credentialed for case enrollment, but because of rapid accrual, not all centers were able to submit cases before trial closure). These 42 patients had the following characteristics: median age was 61 years; 48% had a maximum tumor dimension of <1 cm; 86% had invasive ductal carcinoma; 64% were postmenopausal; the location of tumor was upper outer for 40% and upper central for 21%; 79% had no chemotherapy, and 64% had no hormonal therapy. There were 4 cases with major variations (all 4 related to normal tissue DVHs exceeding 5% of the specified limit). A total of 32 cases with minor variations in treatment plans were detected (16 related to normal tissue DVHs exceeding the specified limits [by < or = 5%], 6 related to suboptimal coverage of the PTV, and 10 related to both). There were 6 cases with no variations. Of the 51 total evaluable patients, 1 additional major variation was noted (PTV receiving <93% of the prescription dose). An additional 5 cases with minor variations in treatment plans were detected (3 related to normal tissue DVHs exceeding the specified limits [by < or = 5%], 1 related to suboptimal coverage of the PTV, and 1 related to both). There were 3 more cases with no variations. CONCLUSION: Accelerated partial breast irradiation using three-dimensional conformal external beam radiation therapy was shown in this preliminary analysis of the first 42 evaluable patients to be technically feasible and reproducible in a multi-institutional trial using exceptionally strict dosimetric criteria."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 281 patients with Stage 0, I, and II breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy received whole breast RT after lumpectomy using our static, multileaf collimator (sMLC) IMRT technique. The technical and practical aspects of implementing this technique on a large scale in the clinic were analyzed. The clinical outcome of patients treated with this technique was also reviewed. RESULTS: The median time required for three-dimensional alignment of the tangential fields and dosimetric IMRT planning was 40 and 45 min, respectively. The median number of sMLC segments required per patient to meet the predefined dose-volume constraints was 6 (range 3-12). The median percentage of the treatment given with open fields (no sMLC segments) was 83% (range 38-96%), and the median treatment time was <10 min. The median volume of breast receiving 105% of the prescribed dose was 11% (range 0-67.6%). The median breast volume receiving 110% of the prescribed dose was 0% (range 0-39%), and the median breast volume receiving 115% of the prescribed dose was also 0%. A total of 157 patients (56%) experienced Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Grade 0 or I acute skin toxicity; 102 patients (43%) developed Grade II acute skin toxicity and only 3 (1%) experienced Grade III toxicity. The cosmetic results at 12 months (95 patients analyzable) were rated as excellent/good in 94 patients (99%). No skin telengiectasias, significant fibrosis, or persistent breast pain was noted. CONCLUSION: The use of intensity modulation with our sMLC technique for tangential whole breast RT is an efficient method for achieving a uniform and standardized dose throughout the whole breast. Strict dose-volume constraints can be readily achieved resulting in both uniform coverage of breast tissue and a potential reduction in acute and chronic toxicities. Because the median number of sMLC segments required per patient is only 6, the treatment time is equivalent to conventional wedged-tangent treatment techniques. As a result, widespread implementation of this technology can be achieved with minimal imposition on clinic resources and time constraints."

Conventional three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) has demonstrated substantial reduction in cardiac doses as compared to treatment in free breathing. The purpose of this treatment planning study is to investigate if dynamic techniques in combination with DIBH could improve the quality of the treatment plans and further reduce the doses to the heart and other organs at risk for early-stage breast cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: CT series in DIBH of 16 patients from a previous study were used. For each patient, treatment plans were generated with the following three techniques: 3D-CRT, tangential intensity-modulated radiotherapy (tIMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy with partial arcs (pVMAT). The treatment planning was performed focusing on planning target volume (PTV) coverage, V95% >95%. Dose-volume histograms were calculated and compared. Doses to the heart, left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, ipsilateral and contralateral lung as well as the contralateral breast (CB) were assessed. RESULTS: All plans fulfilled the criterion on PTV coverage. Compared to 3D-CRT, the dynamic plans obtained better dose homogeneity and conformity. The mean heart dose was similar for 3D-CRT and tIMRT, 1.3 and 1.1 Gy, respectively, but significantly higher for pVMAT, 1.6 Gy. The median V25 Gy to the heart was 0% for all techniques. The LAD doses were generally lower with the dynamic techniques. The mean doses to the ipsi- and contralateral lung and CB were similar with tIMRT and 3D-CRT but significantly higher with pVMAT. V20 Gy to the ipsilateral lung was significantly lower with tIMRT compared to 3D-CRT. CONCLUSION: tIMRT and 3D-CRT with DIBH are better techniques for sparing heart tissue and other organs at risk without compromising target coverage in early-stage breast cancer irradiation compared to VMAT."

For women at high risk of relapse it also increases survival. Breast radiotherapy is usually given using simple planning techniques and serious morbidity is unusual. The greatest concern following adjuvant breast irradiation is of an increase in cardiovascular mortality after 15-20 years. New techniques of breast irradiation including conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) have been shown to reduce cardiac and lung irradiation. In addition, improved dosimetry within the breast may improve both local control and cosmesis. To replace current radiotherapy techniques with those requiring more complex planning would demand an increase in resources including both machinery and staff. In this review we outline the indications and benefits of breast radiotherapy along with the planning process. Technical advances are discussed within the context of improving outcome at a time of limited national resources."

In long-term survivors, this may increase the risk for late toxicity including secondary malignancies. 3DCRT has been successfully used to treat this disease but treatment delivery is often complex requiring matching of photon with electron beams, utilization of field-in-field techniques and of partial transmission blocks. HT is an arc-rotational intensity modulated radiation therapy technique proven to achieve superior target dose conformality and sharp dose gradients around critical normal tissues. HT however, has also been associated with higher volumes of low dose regions in normal tissues and therefore, higher integral dose. The present study was undertaken to compare the dosimetry of 3DCRT to HT in a pediatric patient with advanced HD. Clinical target volume (CTV) included bilateral lower cervical and supraclavicular areas, mediastinum, bilateral hili, left axilla and bilateral diaphragmatic lymph nodes. The planning target volume (PTV) was derived by circumferentially expanding the CTV by 1 cm. Whole lung and heart irradiation was also planned due to bilateral pleural and pericardial effusions. The prescribed radiation dose was 21 Gy to the PTV and 10.5 Gy to the whole lung and heart. Target coverage was comparable for both plans. The minimum, maximum and mean PTV doses were 18.61 Gy, 22.45 Gy and 21.52 Gy with 3DCRT and 19.85 Gy, 22.36 Gy and 21.39 Gy with HT, respectively. HT decreased mean normal tissue dose by 21.6% and 20.07% for right and left breast, 20.40% for lung, 30.78% for heart and 22.74% for the thyroid gland. Integral dose also decreased with HT by 46.50%. HT results in significant dosimetric gain related to normal tissue sparing compared to 3DCRT. Further studies are warranted to evaluate clinical applications of HT in patients with HD."

MATERIALS/METHODS: APBI was delivered using multiplane interstitial brachytherapy as per standard guidelines. Majority of women in WBRT cohort received hypo-fractionated external beam radiotherapy using bitangential portals and mega-voltage photons along with sequential boost to the tumor bed. Single cross-sectional assessment (18-36 months post-treatment completion) of the breast cosmesis was done by RO, SO and the patient using the modified Harvard scale and by photographic assessment using the BCCT.core software. The two cohorts were propensity score-matched using menopausal status, size of surgical cavity, size of tumor in greatest dimension, median number of lymph nodes dissected, treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy and treatment with hormonal therapy. RESULTS: A total of 64 APBI patients were matched with 99 WBRT patients of the entire cohort of 320. At a median follow-up of 25 months, cosmetic results were significantly better for APBI as compared to WBRT cohort by all methods of evaluation (excellent/good: RO:75% vs 38.4%, p = 0.0001; SO: 54.7% vs 37.4%, p = 0.009; patient: 87.5% vs 58.6%, p = 0.001 and BCCT: 73.4% vs 51.6%, p = 0.001). Individual parameters that were significantly better in APBI cohort included size and shape of breast as well as location and shape of NAC. Better results for individual BCCT parameters (pLBC, pBRE, pBAD) were also seen. CONCLUSIONS: Overall cosmetic outcomes as well as individual subdomains are significantly better with APBI as compared to WBRT by all methods of assessment of cosmesis when matched for various factors."

The present study aims at dosimetric comparison of conventional bitangential radiotherapy (RT) technique with conventional [field-in-field (FIF)] and rotational [Helical TomoTherapy((R)) and TomoDirect (TD); Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA] intensity-modulated RT for patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancer (SBBC). METHODS: CT data sets of 10 patients with SBBC were selected for the present study. RT was planned for all patients on both sides to whole breast and/or chest wall using the above-mentioned techniques. Six females with breast conservation on at least one side also had a composite plan along with tumour bed (TB) boost using sequential electrons for bitangential and FIF techniques or sequential helical tomotherapy (HT) boost (for TD) or simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) for HT. RESULTS: All techniques produced acceptable target coverage. The hotspot was significantly lower with FIF technique and HT but higher with TD. For the organs at risk doses, HT resulted in significant reduction of the higher dose volumes. Similarly, TD resulted in significant reduction of the mean dose to the heart and total lung by reducing the lower dose volumes. All techniques of delivering boost to the TB were comparable in terms of target coverage. HT-SIB markedly reduced mean doses to the total lung and heart by specifically lowering the higher dose volumes. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the cardiac and pulmonary sparing ability of tomotherapy in the setting of SBBC. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This is the first study demonstrating feasibility of treatment of SBBC using tomotherapy."

IMRT may result in improved cosmesis compared to standard RT, although at greater expense. To investigate the adoption of IMRT, we examined trends and factors associated with IMRT in women under the age of 65 with early stage breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We performed a retrospective study of early stage breast cancer patients treated with BCS followed by whole-breast irradiation (WBI) who were </=65 years old in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 to 2011. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with receipt of IMRT (vs standard RT). RESULTS: We identified 11,089 women with early breast cancer (9.6%) who were treated with IMRT and 104,448 (90.4%) who were treated with standard RT, after BCS. The proportion of WBI patients receiving IMRT increased yearly from 2004 to 2009, with 5.3% of WBI patients receiving IMRT in 2004 and 11.6% receiving IMRT in 2009. Further use of IMRT declined afterward, with the proportion remaining steady at 11.0% and 10.7% in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Patients treated in nonacademic community centers were more likely to receive IMRT (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.43 for nonacademic vs academic center). Compared to privately insured patients, the uninsured patients (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.95) and those with Medicaid insurance (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.95) were less likely to receive IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: The use of IMRT rose from 2004 to 2009 and then stabilized. Important nonclinical factors associated with IMRT use included facility type and insurance status."

However, no attempts have been made to extend the domain of KBP for planners with different planning experiences so far. The purpose of this study was to quantify the potential gains for planners with different planning experiences after implementing KBP in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans for left-sided breast cancer patients. METHODS: The model libraries were populated with 80 expert clinical plans from treated patients who previously received left-sided breast-conserving surgery and IMRT with simultaneously integrated boost. The libraries were created on the RapidPlan(TM). 6 planners with different planning experiences (2 beginner planners, 2 junior planners and 2 senior planners) generated manual and KBP optimized plans for additional 10 patients, similar to those included in the model libraries. The plan qualities were compared between manual and KBP plans. RESULTS: All plans were capable of achieving the prescription requirement. There were almost no statistically significant differences in terms of the planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose conformality. It was demonstrated that the doses for most of organs-at-risk (OARs) were on average lower or equal in KBP plans compared to manual plans except for the senior planners, where the very small differences were not statistically significant. KBP data showed a systematic trend to have superior dose sparing at most parameters for the heart and ipsilateral lung. The observed decrease in the doses to these OARs could be achieved, particularly for the beginner and junior planners. Many differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to generate acceptable IMRT plans after implementing KBP for left-sided breast cancer. KBP helps to effectively improve the quality of IMRT plans against the benchmark of manual plans for less experienced planners without any manual intervention. KBP showed promise for homogenizing the plan quality by transferring planning expertise from more experienced to less experienced planners."

METHODS: Eighteen breast cancer patients after breast conserving surgery who underwent whole breast IMRT were included in this study. Three dimensional interfraction motion before and after on-line CBCT-based corrections were quantified. The on-line CBCT-based corrections were performed using automated greyscale match. The system SE (Sigma) and random error (sigma) were calculated for each patient based on the consecutive multiple online scanning based on CBCT (>/=5). The trends in magnitudes of Sigma and sigmawere assessed during the treatment. RESULTS: The magnitude variation of Sigma was less than 1 mm before and after on-line CBCT-based corrections. As the CBCT scanning times increase (before 10 times), the Sigma in anteroposterior (AP) direction was increased significantly, and sigmain three dimensional directions was also increased after 7 times of CBCT scanning. After on-line CBCT-based corrections, the Sigma showed a steady trend by variation near zero for the first 20 times irradiation; but after 20 times, the Sigma in AP and superoinferior (SI) directions was increased slightly (less than 0.5 mm), and sigmadecreased in three-dimensional directions. There were no significant differences for Sigma, sigmaand setup margin (SM) before and after on-line CBCT-based corrections in all three directions (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For breast cancer patients who underwent IMRT after breast conserving surgery, the setup error is relatively stable during the whole irradiation.

Methods: One hundred and thirty eight patients with breast cancer receiving radiotherapy (RT) in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into three groups: three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) group, forward intensity-modulated radiotherapy (F-IMRT) group and inverse IMRT (I-IMRT) group. The IMC were contoured according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) consensus, and were not include into the planning target volume (PTV). The incidental irradiation dose to IMC among the three groups and the first three intercostal spaces IMC (ICS-IMC 1-3) were all compared, and explored the relationship between the mean doses (Dmean) of IMC and the OARs (ipsilateral lung and heart). Results: The dose delivered to IMC showed no difference in CRT, F-IMRT and I-IMRT(33.80 Gy, 29.65 Gy and 32.95 Gy). And 10.42%, 2.04%, and 9.76% patients achieved >/=45 Gy when treated with CRT, F-IMRT and I-IMRT. For the IMC dose in the first three intercostal spaces (ICS1-3), there was no difference to the three treatment plannings. The Dmean, V(20), V(30), V(40) and V(50) of the ICS-IMC2 and ICS-IMC3 were all obviously superior than ICS-IMC1 for all these three plannings. Moderate positive correlation was founded between Dmean for IMC and Dmean for heart for left breast cancer patients underwent CRT (r=0.338, P=0.01). Whereas for F-IMRT and I-IMRT groups, positive correlation were founded between Dmean for IMC and Dmean and V(20) for ipsilateral lung for all patients (F-IMRT: r=0.366, P=0.010; r=0.318, P=0.026; I-IMRT: r=0.427, P=0.005; r=0.411, P=0.008). Conclusions: In 3D-CRT, F-IMRT and I-IMRT planning methods, partial patients get IMC irradiated doses that could achieve therapeutic doses. Compared with 3D-CRT, F-IMRT and I-IMRT further reduced the dose of irradiated organs. However, there is no difference in the dose coverage of IMC for the three planned approaches when the IMC made an unplanned target."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Proton treatment plans were created for 11 sequential patients treated with three-dimensional radiotherapy (3DCRT) photon APBI using passive scattering proton beams (PSPB) and were compared with clinically treated 3DCRT photon plans. Monte Carlo calculations were used to verify the accuracy of the proton dose calculation from the treatment planning system. The impact of range, motion, and setup uncertainty was evaluated with tangential vs. en face beams. RESULTS: Compared with 3DCRT photons, the absolute reduction of the mean of V100 (the volume receiving 100% of prescription dose), V90, V75, V50, and V20 for normal breast using protons are 3.4%, 8.6%, 11.8%, 17.9%, and 23.6%, respectively. For breast skin, with the similar V90 as 3DCRT photons, the proton plan significantly reduced V75, V50, V30, and V10. The proton plan also significantly reduced the dose to the lung and heart. Dose distributions from Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated minimal deviation from the treatment planning system. The tangential beam configuration showed significantly less dose fluctuation in the chest wall region but was more vulnerable to respiratory motion than that for the en face beams. Worst-case analysis demonstrated the robustness of designed proton beams with range and patient setup uncertainties. CONCLUSIONS: APBI using multiple proton beams spares significantly more normal tissue, including nontarget breast and breast skin, than 3DCRT using photons. It is robust, considering the range and patient setup uncertainties."

Here we examine the potential incremental benefit of intensity-modulated proton radiotherapy (IMPT) for APBI and compare its dosimetry with PSPB and 3DCRT. METHODS: Two theoretical IMPT plans, TANGENT_PAIR and TANGENT_ENFACE, were created for 11 patients previously treated with 3DCRT APBI and were compared with PSPB and 3DCRT plans for the same CT data sets. The impact of range, motion and set-up uncertainties as well as scanned spot mismatching between fields of IMPT plans was evaluated. RESULTS: IMPT plans for APBI were significantly better regarding breast skin sparing (p<0.005) and other normal tissue sparing than 3DCRT plans (p<0.01) with comparable target coverage (p=ns). IMPT plans were statistically better than PSPB plans regarding breast skin (p<0.002) and non-target breast (p<0.007) in higher dose regions but worse or comparable in lower dose regions. IMPT plans using TANGENT_ENFACE were superior to that using TANGENT_PAIR in terms of target coverage (p<0.003) and normal tissue sparing (p<0.05) in low-dose regions. IMPT uncertainties were demonstrated for multiple causes. Qualitative comparison of dose-volume histogram confidence intervals for IMPT suggests that numeric gains may be offset by IMPT uncertainties. CONCLUSION: Using current clinical dosimetry, PSPB provides excellent dosimetry compared with 3DCRT with fewer uncertainties compared with IMPT. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: As currently delivered in the clinic, PSPB planning for APBI provides as good or better dosimetry than IMPT with less uncertainty."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 28 patients with surgically placed clips in the lumpectomy cavity and two CT scans on different days. To establish whether the clips remain predictive of the lumpectomy cavity throughout therapy, we analyzed the motion of both cavities with repeat volumetric CT scans. The three-dimensional (3D) locations of each lumpectomy cavity and the associated clips were defined as individual regions of interest (ROIs). A single point of interest (POI) was defined for each ROI. The calculated movements of the lumpectomy cavity POIs between different scans were compared to those of the clip POIs. The second CT data set was then moved in accordance to the calculated clip POI's movement. The volume of the (second) lumpectomy cavity associated with the second scan outside of the (first) cavity of the first scan was measured. In addition, the required amount of a radial margin expansion around the first lumpectomy cavity to ensure coverage of the second lumpectomy cavity both before and after moving the second lumpectomy according to the clip POI movement was calculated. RESULTS: The two CT scans were obtained on average 27 days apart, and the mean lumpectomy size decreased from 35 to 16 cc. The clip and lumpectomy cavity POIs moved a mean of 3 mm along the three principal Cartesian axes. In moving the second lumpectomy cavity according to the clip POI displacement from its original position, the volume of the second lumpectomy cavity outside of the volume of the first decreased from 2.6 cc to 1.0 cc after correction, and the required radial margin on the first lumpectomy cavity to include the second lumpectomy cavity decreased from 5.5 mm vs. 3.8 mm. CONCLUSION: The surgically placed clips after lumpectomy are strong radiographic surrogates for the biopsy cavity. If the clips were used to guide accelerated partial breast irradiation, a planning target volume margin of the order of 5 mm could be used, significantly smaller than the 10-mm margin currently employed."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Trial 1 and Trial 2 are 2 consecutive trials of prone-accelerated partial breast irradiation. Eligible for both trials were stage I breast cancer patients with negative margins after breast-conserving surgery. The planning target tumor volume (PTV) was created by extending the surgical cavity 2.0 cm for Trial 1 and 1.5 cm for Trial 2, respectively. Contralateral breast, heart, lungs, and thyroid were contoured. Thirty Gray was delivered in five daily fractions of 6 Gy by a three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy technique in Trial 1 and were by image-guided radiation therapy/intensity-modulated radiation therapy in Trial 2. Dosimetric results from the trials are reported and compared with RTOG 0413 requirements. RESULTS: One hundred forty-six consecutive plans were analyzed: 67 left and 79 right breast cancers. The plans from the trials complied with the required>90% of prescribed dose covering 90% of PTV_EVAL (=generated from the PTV by cropping 0.5 cm from the skin edge and excluding the chest wall): V90% was 98.1+/-3.0% (with V100% and V95%, 89.4+/-12.8%, 96.4+/-5.1%, respectively). No significant difference between laterality was found (Student's t test). The dose constraints criteria of the RTOG-0413 protocol for ipsilateral and contralateral lung (V30<15% and Dmax<3%), heart (V5<40%), and thyroid (Dmax<3%) were satisfied because the plans showed an average V5% of 0.6% (range, 0-13.4) for heart, an average V30% of 0.6% (range, 0-9.1%) for ipsilateral lung, and <2% maximum dose to the thyroid. However, our partial breast irradiation plans demonstrated a higher dose to contralateral breast than that defined by RTOG constraints, with a median value of maximum doses of 4.1% (1.2 Gy), possibly as a result of contouring differences. CONCLUSIONS: Our technique for prone accelerated partial breast irradiation generally satisfied RTOG-0413 requirements."

Recent randomized trials have confirmed that hypofractioned whole-breast irradiation is equivalent to more conventional whole-breast irradiation with respect to local recurrence and cosmetic outcome. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in hypofractionation for the delivery of partial-breast irradiation using a number of techniques including high-dose rate brachytherapy, 3-dimensional conformal radiation using external-beam techniques, and intraoperative therapy. Early cohort studies report good local control and acceptable morbidity. Randomized trials are now underway to compare this approach to conventional whole-breast irradiation."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients were recruited for the delivery of radiotherapy to the postoperative cavity (3850 cGy in 10 fractions over 5 days) using an APBI technique. Cone-beam CT data sets were acquired after an initial skin-mark setup and before treatment delivery. These were registered online using the ipsilateral lung and external contours. Corrections were executed for translations exceeding 3 mm. The random and systematic errors associated with setup using skin-marks and setup using CBCT guidance were calculated and compared. RESULTS: A total of 315 CBCT data sets were analyzed. The systematic errors for the skin-mark setup were 2.7, 1.7, and 2.4 mm in the right-left, anterior-posterior, and superior-inferior directions, respectively. These were reduced to 0.8, 0.7, and 0.8 mm when CBCT guidance was used. The random errors were reduced from 2.4, 2.2, and 2.9 mm for skin-marks to 1.5, 1.5, and 1.6 mm for CBCT guidance in the right-left, anterior-posterior, and superior-inferior directions, respectively. CONCLUSION: A skin-mark setup for APBI patients is sufficient for current planning target volume margins for the population of patients studied here. Online CBCT guidance minimizes the occurrence of large random deviations, which may have a greater impact for the accelerated fractionation schedule used in APBI. It is also likely to permit a reduction in planning target volume margins and provide skin-line visualization and dosimetric evaluation of cardiac and lung volumes."

This paper reports the outcomes of TNRS patients treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We studied 455 patients who received APBI at our institution, using interstitial, intracavitary, and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. TNRS was assigned if a patient tested negative for all three (ER [estrogen receptor], PR [progesterone receptor], and HER2/neu) receptors. Of 202 patients with all receptor results available, 20 patients were designated TNRS, and 182 patients had at least one receptor positive (RP). We analyzed ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), regional nodal failure (RNF), distant metastasis (DM), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 4.1 years for the TNRS group and 5.1 years for the RP cohort (p = 0.11). TNRS patients had a higher histologic grade (59% TNRS vs. 13% RP; p < 0.001). Mean tumor size, stage N1 disease, and margin status were similar. Based on a 5-year actuarial analysis, the TNRS cohort experienced no IBTR, RNF, or DM, with an OS of 100% versus rates of 1.4% IBTR, 1.5% RNF, and 2.8% DM in the RP cohort (p > 0.52). OS for the RP cohort was 93% at 5 years (p > 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: In our patient population, TNRS conferred a clinical outcome similar to that of patients with RP disease treated with APBI. Further investigation with larger patient populations and longer follow-up periods is warranted to confirm that APBI is a safe and effective treatment for patients with localized TNRS breast cancer."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: APBI was used to treat 2127 cases of early-stage breast cancer (WBH, n=678; ASBrS, n=1449). Three forms of APBI were used at WBH (interstitial, n=221; balloon-based, n=255; or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, n=206), whereas all Registry Trial patients received balloon-based brachytherapy. Patients were divided according to the ASTRO CS into suitable (n=661, 36.5%), cautionary (n=850, 46.9%), and unsuitable (n=302, 16.7%) categories. Tumor characteristics and clinical outcomes were analyzed according to CS group. RESULTS: The median age was 65 years (range, 32-94 years), and the median tumor size was 10.0 mm (range, 0-45 mm). The median follow-up time was 60.6 months. The WBH cohort had more node-positive disease (6.9% vs 2.6%, P<.01) and cautionary patients (49.5% vs 41.8%, P=.06). The 5-year actuarial ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), regional nodal failure (RNF), and distant metastasis (DM) for the whole cohort were 2.8%, 0.6%, 1.6%. The rate of IBTR was not statistically higher between suitable (2.5%), cautionary (3.3%), or unsuitable (4.6%) patients (P=.20). The nonsignificant increase in IBTR for the cautionary and unsuitable categories was due to increased elsewhere failures and new primaries (P=.04), not tumor bed recurrence (P=.93). CONCLUSIONS: Excellent outcomes after breast-conserving surgery and APBI were seen in our pooled analysis. The current ASTRO CS guidelines did not adequately differentiate patients at an increased risk of IBTR or tumor bed failure in this large patient cohort."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our single-institution, institutional review board-approved APBI database was queried for patients who had complete testing results for the estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and HER2/neu receptors to determine outcomes for each BCST. Women were assigned as luminal A (LA), luminal B (LB), HER2, and basal BCST using their ER, PR, and HER2/neu receptor status. Degree of ER expression supplemented the receptor-based luminal BCST assignment. Two hundred seventy-eight patients had results for all 3 receptors (LA = 164 [59%], LB = 81 [29%], HER2 = 5 [2%], basal = 28 [10%]), which were submitted for analysis (ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence [IBTR], regional nodal failure, distant metastasis [DM], disease-free survival [DFS], cause-specific survival [CSS], and overall survival [OS]). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 5.4 years (range, 0.1-12.4 years). Basal and HER2 subtype patients had higher histologic grades (Grade 3 = 75% vs. 10% LA/LB; P < .001), larger tumors (13.0 mm basal vs. 10.7 mm LA/LB; P = .059), and were more likely to receive chemotherapy (68% vs. 15% LA/LB; P < .001). Margin and nodal status were similar among BCSTs. At 5 years, IBTR rates were similar (1.8%, 2.9%, 0%, and 4.8%) for LA, LB, HER2, and basal subtypes, respectively (P = .62). DM was only seen in LA (2.9%) and LB (1.3%) (P = .83). DFS (95%-100%), CSS (97%-100%), and OS (80%-100%) were not statistically different (P = .97, .87, .46, respectively). CONCLUSION: Five-year local control rates after breast-conserving surgery, APBI, and appropriate systemic therapy are excellent for luminal, HER2, and basal phenotypes of early-stage breast cancer; however, further study of receptor subtype effect on risk stratification in early-stage breast cancer is needed."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: An anthropomorphic phantom was CT-simulated, and six treatment plans were generated: open tangents, tangents with an external wedge on the lateral beam, tangents with lateral and medial external wedges, a simple segment plan (three segments per tangent), a complex segmental intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plan (five segments per tangent), and a beamlet IMRT plan (>100 segments). For all techniques, the breast on the phantom was irradiated to 5000 cGy. Contralateral breast dose was measured at a uniform depth at the center and each quadrant using thermoluminescent detectors. RESULTS: Contralateral breast dose varied with position and was 50 +/- 7.3 cGy in the inner half, 24 +/- 4.1 cGy at the center, and 16 +/- 2.2 cGy in the outer half for the open tangential plan. Compared with an average dose of 31 cGy across all points for the open field, the average doses were simple segment 32 cGy (range, 99-105% compared with open technique), complex segment 34 cGy (range, 103-117% compared with open technique), beamlet IMRT 34 cGy (range, 103-124% compared with open technique), lateral wedge only 46 cGy (range, 133-175% compared with open technique), and medial and lateral wedge 96 cGy (range, 282-370% compared with open technique). CONCLUSIONS: Single or dual wedge techniques resulted in the highest CBD increases compared with open tangents. To obtain the desired homogeneity to the treated breast while minimizing CBD, segmental and IMRT techniques should be encouraged over external physical compensators."

Imaging techniques were assessed for physical clearance between patient and treatment machine using a volunteer. Nonorthogonal kV image pairs were identified as optimal in terms of image quality, clearance, and dose. After institutional review board approval, this approach was used for 17 patients receiving accelerated partial breast irradiation. Imaging was performed before every fraction verification with online correction of setup deviations >5 mm (total image sessions = 170). Treatment staff rated risk of collision and visibility of tumor bed surgical clips where present. Image session duration and detected setup deviations were recorded. For all cases, both image projections (n = 34) had low collision risk. Surgical clips were rated as well as visualized in all cases where they were present (n = 5). The average imaging session time was 6 min, 16 sec, and a reduction in duration was observed as staff became familiar with the technique. Setup deviations of up to 1.3 cm were detected before treatment and subsequently confirmed offline. Nonorthogonal kV image pairs allowed effective and efficient online verification for partial breast irradiation. It has yet to be tested in a multicenter study to determine whether it is dependent on skilled treatment staff."

Patients with 2 or fewer total RFs have 98% locoregional control at 5 years. Inclusion of total number of RFs in future risk stratification schemes for APBI may be warranted."

While studies have demonstrated similar local control when comparing bAPBI and whole breast irradiation using intensity modulated radiotherapy (WBI-IMRT), comparison of late side effects is limited. Here, we report chronic toxicity profiles associated with these two treatment modalities. METHODS: 1034 patients with early stage breast cancer were treated at a single institution; 489 received standard-fractionation WBI-IMRT between 2000 and 2013 and 545 received bAPBI (interstitial 40%, applicator-based 60%) between 1993 and 2013. Chronic toxicity was evaluated >/=6 months utilizing CTCAE version 3.0; cosmesis was evaluated using the Harvard scale. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 4.6 years (range 0.1-13.4) for WBI-IMRT versus 6.7 years (range 0.1-20.1) for bAPBI (p < 0.001). Compared to WBI-IMRT, bAPBI was associated with higher rates of >/=grade 2 seroma formation (14.4% vs 2.9%, p < 0.001), telangiectasia (12.3% vs 2.1%, p = 0.002) and symptomatic fat necrosis (10.2% vs 3.6%, p < 0.001). Lower rates of hyperpigmentation were observed (5.8% vs 14.5%; p = 0.001). Infection rates were similar (3.3% vs 1.3%, p = 0.07). There was no difference between rates of fair (6.1% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.30) or poor (0.2% vs. 0.5%, p = NS) cosmesis. Mastectomy rates for local recurrence (3.1% for WBI-IMRT and 1.2% for bAPBI, p = 0.06), or for other reasons (0.8% and 0.6%, p = 0.60) were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: With 5-year follow-up, WBI-IMRT and bAPBI are associated with similar, acceptable rates of toxicity. These data further support the utilization of bAPBI as a modality to deliver adjuvant radiation in a safe and efficacious manner."

METHODS: Thirty-two patients were studied. The original approach was for 16 patients and incorporated a directional block of the ipsilateral lung and breast. An additional 16 patients were planned for using a modified approach that incorporates a full block of the ipsilateral lung exclusive of 4 cm around the breast. Dose-volume histograms of targets and critical structures were evaluated. Skin toxicity monitoring was performed throughout treatment and follow-up using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated with patients receiving a median dose of 59.36 Gy. Of the 16 patients in both groups, 8 had grade 2 erythema immediately after radiation. On 3-week follow-up, 10 and 7 patients in the original and modified groups showed grade 1 erythema. On 3- and 6-month follow-up, both groups had minimal erythema, with all patients having either grade 0 or 1 symptoms. No grade 2 or 3 toxicities were reported. Mean treatment time was 7.5 and 10.4 minutes using the original and modified methods. Adequate dose coverage was achieved using both methods (V95 = 99.5% and 98%). Mean dose to the heart was 10.5 and 1.8 Gy, respectively (P < .01). For right-sided tumors, the original and modified plans yielded a mean of 8.8 and 1.1 Gy (P < .01) versus 11.7 and 2.4 Gy for left-sided tumors (P < .01). The mean dose to the ipsilateral lung was also significantly lower in the modified plans (11.8 vs. 5.0 Gy, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Tomotherapy is capable of delivering homogeneous treatment plans to the whole breast and lumpectomy cavity using simultaneous integrated boost treatment. Using the treatment methods described herein, extremely low doses to critical structures can be achieved without compromising acute skin toxicity."

The focus was on possible progressive changes and any relationships between the incidence of primary hypothyroidism, the time required to become hypothyroid, and factors such as chemotherapy, hormonotherapy and immunotherapy. Materials and Methods: Seventy females undergoing 3D conformal and IMRT radiation therapy for breast cancers were enrolled in a non-randomized prospective study. The patients was divided into two groups: those after mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (BCS) were irradiated to a scar of the chest wall/breast and the ipsilateral supraclavicular and the axillary areas (supraclavicular radiotherapy group - SC-RT group - 32 patients) and the control group receiving adjuvant chest wall/breast RT only (BCT group - 38 patients).The total doses were 50.0 to 70 Gy in 5 to 7 weeks. The median follow-up term was 24 months (range, 1-40 months). Thyroid function was evaluated by measuring thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels. The minimum, maximum and mean thyroid gland doses for 20 Gy (V20) were calculated for all patients. Results: Statistically significant results were obtained for the SC-RT group. Two yearsa fter the end of RT the chance of an event was increased in 6% of the population (p=0.009) in the SC-RT group. In the BCT group no significance was noted. No statistically significant differences were found for V20, chemio-, immunotherapy and hormonotherapy or Ki67 values (p=0.12). No significant results were obtained for development of hypothyroidism and clinical factors (age, thyroid volume, treatment modalities). Conclusion: Radiotherapy is associated with a higher incidence of thyroid toxicity in breast cancer patients. Routine thyroid function monitoring should be recommended in such cases."

This study evaluated the impact of guidelines on consistency in target volume contouring for partial breast RT planning. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Guidelines for target volume definition for partial breast radiation therapy (PBRT) planning were developed by members of the steering committee for a pilot trial of PBRT using conformal external beam planning. In phase 1, delineation of the breast seroma in 5 early-stage breast cancer patients was independently performed by a trained"" cohort of four radiation oncologists who were provided with these guidelines and an ""untrained"" cohort of four radiation oncologists who contoured without guidelines. Using automated planning software, the seroma target volume (STV) was expanded into a clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) for each oncologist. Means and standard deviations were calculated, and two-tailed t tests were used to assess differences between the ""trained"" and ""untrained"" cohorts. In phase 2, all eight radiation oncologists were provided with the same contouring guidelines, and were asked to delineate the seroma in five new cases. Data were again analyzed to evaluate consistency between the two cohorts. RESULTS: The ""untrained"" cohort contoured larger seroma volumes and had larger CTVs and PTVs compared with the ""trained"" cohort in three of five cases. When seroma contouring was performed after review of contouring guidelines, the differences in the STVs, CTVs, and PTVs were no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Guidelines can improve consistency among radiation oncologists performing target volume delineation for PBRT planning."""

METHODS: A total of 10 patients with early-stage left-sided breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery were included in this study. IMRT, IMRT-EB and VMAT plans were generated for each patient. RESULTS: The conformity index (CI) of the planning target volumes evaluation (PTV-Eval) of VMAT was significantly superior to those of IMRT and IMRT-EB (P < 0.05). The CI of the PTV Eval-boost of VMAT was better than that of IMRT (P = 0.018) and IMRT-EB (P < 0.001), while the CI of the PTV Eval-boost of IMRT was better than that of IMRT-EB (P = 0.002). The V5, V10 and Dmean in ipsilateral lung with VMAT were significantly higher than IMRT (P < 0.05) and IMRT-EB (P < 0.05). The Dmean, V5 and V10 in heart with VMAT were significantly greater than those of IMRT and IMRT-EB (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the OARs between IMRT and IMRT-EB (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Considered the target volume coverage and radiation dose delivered to the OARs (especially the heart and lung), IMRT may be more suitable for the SIB in WBI than IMRT-EB and VMAT. Additional clinical studies with a larger sample size will be needed to assess the long-term feasibility and efficacy of SIB using different radiotherapy techniques."

Treatment plans were generated using three techniques: volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with a partial arc of 190 degrees (1ARC), VMAT with two tangential mini-arcs of 50 degrees each (2TARC) and intensity modulated radiation therapy with four fixed angle fields (4IMRT). Dosimetric parameters for the whole breast (Target), the boost tumor bed (Boost), and surrounding normal organs were compared. Chair Index (CHI) was introduced to evaluate the dose homogeneity in Target given the two levels of prescription dose. The dose coverage in Target was better in 1ARC and 2TARC than that in 4IMRT. The mean CHI in 1ARC (2.47) and 2TARC (2.62) were higher than that in 4IMRT (1.71, p < 0.05), and this indicated the dose homogeneity of Target was better in 1ARC and 2TARC than that in 4IMRT. The mean doses to right lung, and contralateral breast in 4IMRT were lower than those in 2TARC but the differences between them were small. 2TARC was better than 4IMRT with respect to the dose to ipsilateral lung and heart.

The 3 different planning techniques were analyzed for 8 patients with left-sided breast conserving surgery. Plans were compared on the basis of planning target volume (PTV) dose conformity, homogeneity and the volumes of normal tissues treated based on dose-volume histograms (DVHs). DVHs were calculated for the PTV, heart, and the bilateral lungs, contralateral breast, and soft tissue surrounding the breast PTV (VOB) volume. IP-IMRT and hybrid IMRT techniques comparably improved the PTV dose homogeneity and conformity (CI) significantly, compared to the conventional 3D-CRT technique (P<0.017); the IP-IMRT technique only could additionally benefit patients by decreasing the high-dose (40 Gy) volume for heart and ipsilateral lung compared with the hybrid IMRT technique (P<0.017); the hybrid IMRT plans achieved a further improvement by compromising the increase of low-dose volume (total lung V13, contralateral lung V5, heart V10 and soft tissue surrounding the breast V5) compared with IP-IMRT plans (P<0.017). Hybrid IMRT plans achieved equivalent PTV dose uniformity to IP-IMRT plans and compromised the low-dose volume and requirement of clinic resource between IP-IMRT and 3D-CRT plans, promoting it as a standard practice of left-sided breast irradiation for patients in good-ordered cardiopulmonary health."

METHODS: Fourteen previously treated patients with early-stage breast cancer were selected for a retrospective study. Six of these patients had been treated to 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions in a phase III accelerated partial breast trial and the rest of the patients were treated to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. In this planning study, the guidelines in the protocol for the phase III partial breast trial were followed for organ delineation and CyberKnife planning. The achievable dosimetric parameters from all CyberKnife plans were compared to Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and 3D-CRT methods. The reproducibility of the dose delivery with and without respiratory motion was assessed through delivering a patient plan to a breast phantom. Different dose calculation algorithms were also compared between ray tracing and Monte Carlo. RESULTS: For all the patients in the study, the dosimetric parameters met the guidelines from the NSABP B39RTOG 0413 protocol strictly. The mean PTV volume covered by 100% of the prescription dose was 95.7 +/- 0.7% (94.7%-97.1%). The mean maximal dose was 104 +/- 2% of the prescription dose. The mean V(50%) and mean V(100%) to the ipsilateral normal breast were 23.1 +/- 11.6% and 9.0 +/- 5.8%, respectively. The conformity index of all plans was 1.14 +/- 0.04. The maximum dose to the contralateral breast varied from 1.3 cGy to 111 cGy. The mean V(5%) and mean V(30%) to the contralateral and ipsilateral lungs were 1.0 +/- 1.6% and 1.3 +/- 1.2%, respectively. In our study, the mean V(5%) to the heart was 0.2 +/- 0.5% for right-sided tumors and 9.4 +/- 10.1% for left-sided tumors. Compared with IMRT and 3D-CRT planning, the PTV coverage from CyberKnife planning was the highest, and the ratio of V(20%) to V(100%) of the breast from CyberKnife planning was the smallest. The heart and lung doses were similar in all the techniques except that the V(5%) for the lung and heart in CyberKnife planning was slightly higher. CONCLUSIONS: The dosimetric feasibility of APBI using CyberKnife was investigated in this retrospective study. All the dosimetric parameters strictly met the guidelines from the NSABP B39RTOG 0413 protocol. With advanced real-time tracking capability, CyberKnife should provide better target coverage and spare nearby critical organs for APBI treatment."

Ten patients with left-sided breast cancer undergoing breast conservation surgery were enrolled. For each patient, 4 treatment plans were performed: a helical tomotherapy (HT) plan, a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan, a static intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan, and a hybrid IMRT plan, designed to encompass the whole breast, internal mammary, and supraclavicular nodal regions. The prescribed dose of radiation was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The dosimetric parameters of the target and organs at risk, as well as the dose delivery time, were evaluated and compared using an independent-samples t-test. The HT and VMAT plans had the best conformity and homogeneity. For the HT, VMAT, IMRT, and hybrid IMRT plans, the mean conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) were 0.83, 0.82, 0.8, and 0.77 (p < 0.001); and 1.07, 1.11, 1.14, and 1.14 (p < 0.001), respectively. The corresponding V55 values were 0.3%, 11.4%, 27.02%, and 23.29% (p < 0.001). The Dmean and V20 of the left lung obtained using the HT plan were significantly lower than those of VMAT, IMRT, and hybrid IMRT plans (p=0.002, p=0.004). There were no significant differences in D max of LAD descending coronary artery, or the Dmean of the heart among the 4 types of plans. The HT and VMAT plans had a lower dose to other organ at risk (OARs) compared with the IMRT and hybrid IMRT plans. The mean delivery times were 1042 +/- 33 seconds, 136 +/- 12 seconds, 450 +/- 65 seconds, and 451 +/- 70 seconds for the HT, VMAT, IMRT, and hybrid IMRT plans, respectively (p < 0.001). For whole breast plus supraclavicular and internal mammary nodal irradiation in left-sided breast cancer, the VMAT technique is recommended considering both the dose distribution and the delivery time. Under circumstances in which dose distribution is a priority, the HT technique is a valid option."

The aims of this study were to evaluate change in seroma volume on repeat CTs and to explore whether replanning is necessary in breast conserving radiotherapy (RT) using the intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB). Thirty patients underwent WBI with 84 CT scans (24 with 3 CTs (CT1, CT2 and CT3) and 6 without CT3) during the 6 weeks of RT were reviewed. TB and other target volumes on all CTs were delineated and compared. IMRT-SIB treatment plans with 50.68 Gy to the whole breast and 64.4 Gy to the boost in 28 fractions were constructed in the CT1. Replan and hybrid plan (without replanning) in the CT2 were reproduced. Dosimetric differences between the replans and hybrid plans were also compared. The mean TB volumes for CT1, CT2 and CT3 were 42.1 cm(3), 20.1 cm(3), 17.0 cm(3), respectively. The mean TB volume reduction was 40.5% from the CT1 to CT2 and 4.3% from the CT2 to CT3. The difference of TB volumes between the CT1 and CT2 was statistically significance (p < 0.001), but not significant between the CT2 and CT3 (p = 1.000). For all patients, target coverage remained adequate with either hybrid plans or replans. However, replanning can significantly decrease the whole breast mean dose (35.2 vs. 35.6 Gy, p = 0.026) and breast volume outside the boost receiving 95% of the boost prescribed dose (39.5 vs. 68.2 cm(3), p < 0.001). In summary, boost volume could irradiate adequately after the significance shrinkage of tumor bed with the fractionated schedule of IMRT-SIB, but replanning on a second CT could avoid the undesired high dose irradiated breast tissue outside boost."

METHODS: This study included 113,841 DCIS patients from the National Cancer Data Base, of whom 8,709 (6.5 %) underwent APBI-b and 105,132 (93.5 %) underwent external beam irradiation after lumpectomy between 2003 and 2011. Trends in APBI-b use, American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guideline concordance, and independent factors related to APBI-b use were examined. RESULTS: APBI-b use increased from 1.6 % in 2003 to 11.9 % in 2008 and then decreased to 9.1 % in 2011 (p < 0.001). Before 2009, 24.6 % of patients undergoing APBI-b were in the ASTRO guideline 'unsuitable' category, but this proportion decreased to 14.6 % after 2009 (p < 0.001). When adjusting for year of diagnosis, patient, tumor, and facility factors, the four strongest independent factors for APBI-b use were year of diagnosis followed by facility location, facility volume, and facility type. APBI-b use was highest in the East South Central census region (13.1 %) and lowest in the New England region (2.0 %). A statistically significant interaction was identified between facility type and volume. Patients in community cancer programs of large volume were more likely to receive APBI-b, whereas patients in larger academic programs were less likely to receive APBI-b. CONCLUSION: APBI-b for DCIS decreased from 2008 to 2011. After year of diagnosis, facility factors were most strongly associated with APBI-b use as opposed to patient and tumor factors. Reasons for these trends are multifactorial and deserve further study."

The 4-year actuarial recurrence rates for true recurrence/marginal miss and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence were 2.3% and 3.6%, respectively. The 4-year actuarial rates for overall survival, cause-specific survival, and disease-free survival were 97%, 98%, and 92%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The strut-based applicator was designed to simplify APBI compared to interstitial brachytherapy. This report confirms excellent tumor control and survival with low toxicity and supports the evidence that brachytherapy has less normal tissue toxicity than APBI with external beam irradiation."

The pathophysiology of cardiotoxicity, history of breast radiotherapy, current methods of cardiac avoidance, modern outcomes, context of historical outcomes, quantifying cardiac effects, and future directions are reviewed in this article. Radiation-induced oxidative stress induces proinflammatory cytokines and is a process that potentiates late effects of fibrosis and intimal proliferation in endothelial vasculature. Breast radiation therapy has changed substantially in recent decades. Several modern technologies exist to improve cardiac avoidance such as deep inspiration breath hold, gating, accelerated partial breast irradiation, and use of modern 3-dimensional planning. Modern outcomes may vary notably from historical long-term cardiac outcomes given the differences in cardiac dose with modern techniques. Methods of quantifying radiation-related cardiotoxicity that correlate with future cardiac risks are needed with current data exploring techniques such as measuring computed tomography coronary artery calcium score, single-photon emission computed tomography imaging, and biomarkers. Placing historical data, dosimetric correlations, and relative cardiac risk in context are key when weighing the benefits of radiotherapy in breast cancer control and survival. Estimating present day cardiac risk in the modern treatment era includes challenges in length of follow-up and the use of confounding cardiotoxic agents such as evolving systemic chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Future directions in both multidisciplinary management and advancing technology in radiation oncology may provide further improvements in patient risk reduction and breast cancer survivorship."

Medline, Cochrane, and Embase were searched for studies pertaining to radiation-induced skin toxicity in breast cancer patients. The search results were limited to randomized trials of external beam radiotherapy conducted in humans and reported in the English language. The primary outcome was the incidence or severity of radiation dermatitis. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. A total of 96 studies were included in the present review. These evaluated the effect of different radiotherapy techniques, topical treatments, supplements, skin care regimens, and treatments on radiation dermatitis. Few topical agents and oral supplements demonstrated their effectiveness across the randomized trials; however, various radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy, accelerated partial breast irradiation, simultaneous integrated boost, and prone positioning consistently demonstrated decreased rates of radiation dermatitis, despite the limited number of studies in which they were evaluated."

Deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique using the Abches system is an easy and practical method to reduce radiation dose to the heart and lungs. This retrospective study was proposed to investigate the dosimetric difference between Abches system and free breathing technique in treating left-sided breast cancer.Eligible patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scans to acquire both free breathing (FB) and DIBH technique data using the Abches. For each patient, both FB and DIBH image sets were planned based on the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Radiation dose to the heart, ipsilateral lung, and contralateral lung was compared between the Abches system and FB.No significant differences in the planning target volume (PTV) (674.58 vs 665.88 cm, P = .29), mean dose (52.28 vs 52.03 Gy, P = .13), and volume received at the prescribed dose (Vpd) (94.66% vs 93.92%, P = .32) of PTV were observed between the FB and DIBH plans.

The techniques evaluated were noncoplanar 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D CRT), noncoplanar intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRTNC), coplanar IMRT (IMRTCO), and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). The planning CT scans of 16 patients in the prone position were used in this study, with the single-fraction prescription doses of 15 Gy for the first eight patients and 18 Gy for the remaining eight patients. Six (6) MV photon beams were designed to avoid the heart and contralateral breast. Optimization for IMRT and VMAT was performed to reduce the dose to the skin and normal breast. All plans were normalized such that 100% of the prescribed dose covered greater than 95% of the clinical target volume (CTV) consisting of gross tumor volume (GTV) plus 1.5 cm margin. Mean homogeneity index (HI) was the lowest (1.05 +/- 0.02) for 3D CRT and the highest (1.11 +/- 0.04) for VMAT. Mean conformity index (CI) was the lowest (1.42 +/- 0.32) for IMRTNC and the highest (1.60 +/- 0.32) for VMAT. Mean of the maximum point dose to skin was the lowest (73.7 +/- 11.5%) for IMRTNC and the highest (86.5 +/- 6.68%) for 3D CRT. IMRTCO showed very similar HI, CI, and maximum skin dose to IMRTNC (differences &lt;1%). The estimated mean treatment delivery time, excluding the time spent for patient positioning and imaging, was 7.0 +/- 1.0, 8.3 +/- 1.1, 9.7 +/- 1.0, and 11.0 +/- 1.5min for VMAT, IMRTCO, IMRTNC and 3D CRT, respectively. In comparison of all four techniques for preoperative single-fraction partial breast radiotherapy, we can conclude that noncoplanar or coplanar IMRT were optimal in this study as IMRT plans provided homogeneous and conformal target coverage, skin sparing, and relatively short treatment delivery time."

There is a lack of research regarding breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) using VMAT with prone positioning. We developed a new small-arc VMAT methodology and compared it to conventional (fixed-field) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in the dosimetric and treatment relevant parameters for breast cancer patients in the prone position.Ten early-stage breast cancer patients were included in this exploratory study. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) simulation scan in the prone position and for each patient, IMRT and VMAT plans were generated using the Monaco planning system. Two symmetrical partial arcs were applied in the VMAT plans. The angle ranges of the 2 arcs were set to approximately 60 degrees to 100 degrees and 220 degrees to 260 degrees , with small adjustments to maximize target coverage, while minimizing lung and heart exposure. The IMRT plans used 4 fixed fields. Prescribed doses were 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The target coverage, homogeneity, conformity, dose to organs at risk (OAR), treatment time, and monitor units (MU) were evaluated.Higher median conformal index (CI) and lower homogeneity index (HI) of the planning target volume (PTV) were respectively observed in VMAT and plans group (CI, 95% vs 91%; HI, 0.09 vs 0.12; P < 0.001). The volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 30, 20, 10, and 5 Gy were lower for VMAT (P < 0.01), being 10%, 14.9%, 25.9%, and 44.9%, respectively, compared to 11.79%, 17.32%, 30.27%, and 50.58% for the IMRT plans. The mean lung dose was also reduced from 10.6 +/- 1.8 to 9.6 +/- 1.4 Gy (P = 0.001). The volumes of the heart receiving 30 and 40 Gy were similar for the 2 methods. In addition, the median treatment time (161 vs 412 seconds; P < 0.001) and the mean MU (713 vs 878; P < 0.001) were lower for VMAT.Small-arc VMAT plan improved CI and HI for the target, spared the dose of lung, and reduced treatment time and MU, compared to IMRT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with advanced left breast cancer who had received modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and needed adjuvant radiotherapy including nodal irradiation were assessed. Among 23 radiotherapy treatment plans, 17 plans were designed by using TVMAT technique and 6 plans were designed by using traditional VMAT. The main difference of TVMAT from VMAT was that the area of avoidance sector within specific degrees of angle that had no monitor unit (MU) delivery was used in the arc planning, including a total of 5 sectors in 5 partial arcs. The dosimetries of planning target volume (PTV), right breast, bilateral lungs, and heart between TVMAT and VMAT were compared. RESULTS: The conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) of PTV between two groups were statistically equivalent (CI: 0.98 +/- 0.02 and 0.98 +/- 0.03, P = 0.431; HI: 0.12 +/- 0.03 and 0.11 +/- 0.05, P = 0.177), which indicated that the treatment efficacy of the plans regarding TVMAT was compatible with VMAT. However, all neighboring organs at risk (OAR) showed a great percentage of reduction in mean doses (right breast: 53.1%, right lung: 37.7%, left lung: 8.8%, heart: 21.2%) and low dose parameters (V10: right breast: 72.3%, right lung: 86.1%, left lung: 12.5%, heart: 25.1%; V5: right breast: 56.5%, right lung: 28.3%, left lung: 12.7%, heart: 18.2%) by using TVMAT. CONCLUSION: TVMAT greatly decreases the radiation doses delivered to the OAR with maintained therapeutic efficacy. It is highly recommended for treating breast cancer, especially for difficult cases with left side disease needing nodal irradiation."

This study compared the dosimetric characteristics of tangent-based volumetric modulated arc therapy (TVMAT) and TIMRT for left breast cancer patients during deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) and free breathing (FB) techniques. METHODS: Fourteen patients with left breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery were included. The first arc started at 331.8-353.6 degrees and stopped at 281.8-315.0 degrees. The third arc started at 123.2-149.1 degrees and stopped at 88.0-96.0 degrees. The second and fourth arcs were reverse arcs of first and third arcs. DIBH-TIMRT inversing plans were generated using opposing tangential fields. Wilcoxon signed rank test and Spearman correlation were used to examine the significance of dose difference. RESULTS: Compared with FB-TVMAT, the mean heart dose of DIBH-TVMAT plans was reduced from 7.9 Gy to 3.2 Gy (p < 0.001). The average left lung volume receiving 30 Gy or more (V30Gy) was reduced from 12.9 to 5.7% (p < 0.001). DIBH-TVAMT plans resulted in a lower mean dose to the contralateral breast and lung (2 Gy and 0.7 Gy vs 3.4 Gy and 1.5 Gy, respectively) as compared to FB-TVMAT plans. Compared with DIBH-TIMRT, the average left lung V30Gy of DIBH-TVMAT plans was reduced from 8.5 to 5.7% (p = 0.031). As for low-dose areas, exposure of the left lung, right breast, heart and right lung volume with 10 Gy or more was not significantly different between the IMRT- and VMAT-plans. CONCLUSIONS: DIBH-TVMAT for left breast cancer treatment retains treatment plan quality similar to the DIBH-IMRT technique without compromising dose restrictions to the heart, right breast and right lung. DIBH-TVMAT increased left lung protection but still had higher V5Gy to right breast and substantially higher V5Gy to heart. For left breast cancer patients receiving treatment with the DIBH technique, DIBH-TVMAT provides better treatment quality and is a safe and feasible treatment strategy."

Supine and prone scan sets were acquired during free breathing for all patients. Target volumes and organs at risk (OARs) including the heart, ipsilateral lung and bilateral breast were contoured by the same radiation oncologist. For each patient, supine and prone EB-PBI plans were generated based on the same planning criteria. The clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) in the prone position were significantly greater than those in the supine position (P = 0.003, 0.004, respectively). A 0.95 Gy reduction in the mean dose (Dmean) to the heart (P = 0.000) was apparent in the supine position compared to the prone position. The Dmean to the ipsilateral lung was significantly lower in the prone position than in the supine position (1.59 Gy vs. 1.72 Gy, P = 0.029). Therefore, for Chinese breast cancer patients, carrying out 3DCRT EB-PBI in the prone position during free breathing is feasible."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: At lumpectomy, gold fiducial markers were strategically sutured to the surrounding walls of the cavity. Weekly fluoroscopy imaging was conducted at treatment to investigate the respiration-induced target motions. Daily pre- and post-RT kV imaging was performed, and images were matched to digitally reconstructed radiographs based on bony anatomy and fiducial markers, respectively, to determine the intrafractional motion magnitudes over the course of treatment. The positioning differences of the laser tattoo- and the bony anatomy-based setups compared with those of the marker-based setup (benchmark) were also determined. The study included 21 patients. RESULTS: Although lung exhibited significant motion, the average marker motion amplitude on the fluoroscopic image was about 1 mm. Over a typical treatment time period, average intrafractional motion magnitude was 4.2 mm and 2.6 mm based on the marker and bony anatomy matching, respectively. The bony anatomy- and laser tattoo-based interfractional setup errors, with respect to the fiducial marker-based setup, were 7.1 and 9.0 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Respiration has limited effects on the target motion during APBI. Bony anatomy-based treatment setup improves the accuracy relative to that of the laser tattoo-based setup approach. Since fiducial markers are sutured directly to the surgical cavity, the marker-based approach can further improve the interfractional setup accuracy. On average, a seroma cavity exhibits intrafractional motion of more than 4 mm, a magnitude that is larger than that which is otherwise derived based on bony anatomy matching. A seroma-specific marker-based approach has the potential to improve treatment accuracy by taking the true inter- and intrafractional motions into consideration."

METHODS: A prospective, single arm trial was designed to investigate the utility of gold fiducial markers in image guided APBI using 3D-CRT. At the time of lumpectomy, four to six suture-type gold fiducial markers were sutured to the walls of the cavity. Patients were treated with a fractionation scheme consisting of 15 fractions with a fractional dose of 333 cGy. Treatment design and planning followed NSABPRTOG B-39 guidelines. During radiation treatment, daily kV imaging was performed and the markers were localized and tracked. The change in distance between fiducial markers was analyzed based on the planning CT and daily kV images. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were simulated at an average of 28 days after surgery, and started the treatment on an average of 39 days after surgery. The average intermarker distance (AiMD) between fiducial markers was strongly correlated to seroma volume. The average reduction in AiMD was 19.1% (range 0.0%-41.4%) and 10.8% (range 0.0%-35.6%) for all the patients between simulation and completion of radiotherapy, and between simulation and beginning of radiotherapy, respectively. The change of AiMD fits an exponential function with a half-life of seroma shrinkage. The average half-life for seroma shrinkage was 15 days. After accounting for the reduction which started to occur after surgery through CT simulation and treatment, radiation was found to have minimal impact on the distance change over the treatment course. CONCLUSIONS: Using the marker distance change as a surrogate for seroma volume, it appears that the seroma cavity experiences an exponential reduction in size. The change in seroma size has implications in the size of the CTV, PTV, and percent of normal breast tissue irradiated when using 3D-CRT."

Computed tomography scans from 20 patients (12 left sided and 8 right sided) previously treated with T1N0 carcinoma were selected for this dosimetric planning study. We designed HT, IP-IMRT, and FP-FIF plans for each patient. Plans were compared according to dose-volume histogram analysis in terms of PTV homogeneity and conformity indices (HI and CI) as well as OARs dose and volume parameters. Both HI and CI of the PTV showed statistically significant difference among IP-IMRT, FP-FIF, and HT with those of HT were best (P < .05). Compared to FP-FIF, IP-IMRT showed smaller exposed volumes of ipsilateral lung, heart, contralateral lung, and breast, while HT indicated smaller exposed volumes of ipsilateral lung but larger exposed volumes of contralateral lung and breast as well as heart. In addition, HT demonstrated an increase in exposed volume of ipsilateral lung (except for fraction of lung volume receiving >30 Gy and 20 Gy), heart, contralateral lung, and breast compared with IP-IMRT. For breast cancer radiotherapy (RT) after conservative surgery, HT provides better dose homogeneity and conformity of PTV compared to IP-IMRT and FP-FIF techniques, especially for patients with supraclavicular lymph nodes involved. Meanwhile, HT decreases the OAR volumes receiving higher doses with an increase in the volumes receiving low doses, which is known to lead to an increased rate of radiation-induced secondary malignancies. Hence, composite factors including dosimetric advantage, clinical effect, and economic burden should be taken into comprehensive consideration when choosing an RT technique in clinical practice."

The aim of this study was to compare dosimetric parameters of the planning target volume(PTV) and organs at risk (OARs) between conventional radiation therapy (CR), 3-D conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), and direct machine parameter optimisation intensity-modulated radiation therapy (DMPO-IMRT) after breast-conserving surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Computed tomography (CT) scans from 20 patients (13 left-sided and 7 right-sided) previously treated with T1N0 or ductal carcinoma were selected for this dosimetric planning study. We designed CR, 3DCRT and DMPO-IMRT plans for each patient. The prescribed dose was 50 Gy/2 Gy/25 f, 95% of PTV received the prescription dose. Doses were computed with a commercially available treatment planning system using convolution/superimposition (CS) algorithm. Plans were compared according to dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis in terms of PTV homogeneity and conformity indices (HI and CI) as well as OARs dose and volume parameters. RESULTS: Both the HI and CI of the PTV showed statistically significant difference between CR, 3DCRT and DMPO-IMRT with those of DMPO-IMRT were best (P < 0.05). Compared with CR, 3DCRT showed smaller exposed volumes of ipsilateral lung, contralateral breast and heart while DMPO-IMRT indicated larger exposed volumes of ipsilateral lung (except for V20 and V30), contralateral breast and heart. In addition, DMPO-IMRT demonstrated an increase of exposed volume of ipsilateral lung (except for V30), contralateral breast and heart compared with 3DCRT. CONCLUSIONS: In WBI of breast cancer after conservative surgery, 3DCRT and DMPO-IMRT improved the homogeneity and conformity of the PTV compared with CR. Meanwhile, 3DCRT reduced the irradiated volumes of OARs at all dose levels listed in our study while DMPO-IMRT reduced the irradiated volumes of OARs in high-dose areas but increased the irradiated volumes of OARs in low-dose areas."

One-way analysis of variance was performed to compare differences, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Homogeneity index of plan III is lower than those of plans I and II. No difference was identified in conformity index of targets. Plan I exhibited difference in mean dose (Dmean ) for the heart (P < 0.05). Plan I featured smaller irradiation dose volumes in V5 , V20 (P < 0.05) of the left lung than II. Plan I exhibited significantly higher V5 in the right lung than plans II and III (P < 0.05). Under plan I, irradiation dose at V5 in the right breast is higher than that in plans II and III. Patients in plan III presented less total monitor unit and total treatment time than those in plans I and II (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IMRT six-field plans II, and field-in-field-direct machine parameter optimization-IMRT plans III can reduce doses and volumes to the lungs and heart better while maintaining satisfying conformity index and homogeneity index of target. Nevertheless, plan II neglects target movements caused by respiration. In the same manner, plan III can substantially reduce MU and shorten patient treatment time. Therefore, plan III, which considers target movement caused by respiration, is a more practical radiation mode."

The average of V47.5Gy, V45Gy and V40Gy (percent volume receiving>/= 47.5Gy, 45Gy and 40Gy) of the axillary level I in s-IMRT plan was significantly lower than that in for-IMRT plan (p < 0.001). For for-IMRT plans, patients with upper tangential border to humeral head </=2cm, breast separation >19.3cm and body width >31.9cm had significantly higher mean dose in axillary level I area (p = 0.002, 0.007, 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Compared with for-IMRT plan, the s-IMRT plan delivered lower dose to axillary level I area. For centers using s-IMRT technique, caution should be exercised when selecting to omit axillary lymph node dissection for patients with breast conserving surgery and limited positive SLNs."

METHODS: The patients, who received breast-conserving surgery with silver clips marked at the margins of the cavity and were suitable for EB-PBI, were immobilized on the breast bracket to undertake CT simulation assisted by ABC device, six sets of CT simulation images including two sets of image in state of moderate deep inspiration breathing control (mDIBH), two sets of images in state of free breath (FB) and two sets of images in state of deep expiration breathing control (DEBH) were obtained. The six sets of images were transferred to Pinnacle(3) treatment planning system (TPS), then automatic fusion and registration between two sets of mDIBH images, two sets of FB images, two sets of DEBH images and mDIBH image and DEBH image were achieved separately. Thereafter, the overlap ratios of GTV with GTV, CTV with CTV, PTV with PTV were calculated by the Pinnacle(3) TPS. The differences between the overlap ratios of the three kinds of targets in the same registered image and the difference between the overlap ratios of the same kind of target in the different registered images were statistically analyzed using statistical package of SPSS 11.5. RESULTS: Based on mDIBH/mDIBH registration, the overlap ratios of GTV/GTV, CTV/CTV and PTV/PTV were (83.54 +/- 11.41)%, (93.00 +/- 6.49)%, and (95.26 +/- 4.90)%, respectively, and the differences of the overlap ratios between GTV/GTV and CTV/CTV, GTV/GTV and PTV/PTV were all statistically significant (P < 0.05), but statistically not significant between CTV/CTV and PTV/PTV (P > 0.05). Based on FB/FB registration, the overlap ratios of GTV/GTV, CTV/CTV and PTV/PTV were (72.55 +/- 29.10)%, (89.36 +/- 9.53)% and (92.47 +/- 7.25)%, respectively, and the differences of the overlap ratios between GTV/GTV and CTV/CTV, CTV/CTV and PTV/PTV were all not statistically significant (P > 0.05), but statistically significant between GTV/GTV and PTV/PTV (P < 0.05). Based on DEBH/DEBH registration, the overlap ratios of GTV/GTV, CTV/CTV and PTV/PTV were (79.48 +/- 22.31)%, (92.83 +/- 6.77)% and (95.05 +/- 4.81)%, respectively, and the differences of the overlap ratios between GTV/GTV and CTV/CTV (P = 0.000), CTV/CTV and PTV/PTV (P = 0.037), GTV/GTV and PTV/PTV (P = 0.000) were statistically all significant (P = 0.000). The differences of the overlap ratios of GTV/GTV, CTV/CTV, and PTV/PTV (P = 0.000) between mDIBH/mDIBH and DEBH/DEBH, mDIBH/mDIBH and FB/FB, FB/FB and DEBH/DEBH were all statistically significant (P = 0.000), and not statistically significant between mDIBH/mDIBH and mDIBH/DEBH, FB/FB and mDIBH/DEBH. CONCLUSIONS: During the delivering of EB-PBI assisted by ABC, the intra-fractional overlap ratios of the target volume between the same breathing state is increasing in the order of GTV/GTV --> CTV/CTV --> PTV/PTV. The difference of the overlap ratios of the target volumes between mDIBH and mDIBH, FB and FB, DEBH and DEBH is not significant, and the overlap ratios of PTV/PTV in the three breathing statuses of mDIBH, FB and DEBH reaches a higher level. Therefore, from the perspective of target volume overlap, if the setup error is corrected online before delivering, the necessity of breathing control during delivering of EB-PBI is worthy discussing."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Carbon fiducials were placed intraoperatively in the periphery of the lumpectomy cavity. Nine patients received whole breast irradiation with a boost, and 2 patients received 3-dimensional conformal partial breast irradiation. A total of 89 fractions were assessed for setup errors relative to a predefined gold standard, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) match to the lumpectomy cavity, using the following 4 setup methods: (1) Align skin tattoos with lasers; (2) match bone with 2-dimensional-2-dimensional (2D/2D) kV onboard imaging (OBI); (3) match the whole breast with CBCT; and (4) match carbon fiducials with 2D/2D kV OBI. The margin for the planning target volume (PTV) was calculated by 2 standard deviations of the setup errors, and compared among the 4 setup methods. Setup errors for patients treated with free breathing and patients with deep inspiration breath hold were also compared. RESULTS: The carbon fiducials were sufficiently visible on OBI for matching and introduced minimal artifacts. Of the 4 alignment methods, 2D/2D OBI match to fiducials resulted in the smallest setup errors. The PTV margin was 12 mm for aligning skin tattoos using lasers, 9.2 mm for matching bone on OBI, 6.5 mm for matching breast on CBCT, and 3.5 mm for matching fiducials on 2D/2D OBI. Compared with free breathing, deep inspiration breath hold generally reduced the standard deviations of the setup errors, but further investigation would be needed. CONCLUSIONS: Matching to carbon fiducials increased the localization accuracy to the lumpectomy cavity. This reduces residual setup error and PTV margins, facilitating tissue sparing without diminishing treatment efficacy."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with left sided breast cancer whose breast was relatively smaller (the mean volumes is 296 cc) treated with breast-conserving surgery were prescribed radiotherapy of 50 Gy in 25 fractions using two or four-field step and shoot IMRT (2 or 4-F IMRT), and one or two-arc VMAT (1 or 2-arc VMAT). The 10 Gy electron boost to the tumor bed after delivery of 50 Gy was not included in the analysis. Multiple planning parameters for the PTV and the PRV-OARs were measured and analyzed. RESULTS: Treatment plans generated using VMAT had better PTV homogeneity than the IMRT plans. For the PRV-OARs, the 1-arc VMAT had significantly higher Dmean and V5 for left lung and heart, and showed worse Dmean for liver, esophagus, spinal cord, contralateral lung and breast. In contrast, the 2-arc VMAT and the 2-F or 4-F IMRT plans showed better results for the PRV-OARs than the 1-arc VMAT. However, for the heart and coronary artery, the 1-arc VMAT showed better V20 and V40 compared with the other plans. Moreover, the 2 F-IMRT had specially advantage on V5 and V20 for heart and V5 for coronary arteries, the 2-F IMRT also showed a greater MU and treatment times. Using the table of quality score to evaluate the plans, we found that 2-F IMRT had the highest scores of 13, followed by the 2-arc VMAT plan (10 points) and 1-arc VMAT plan (8 points), and finally the 4-F IMRT plan (6 points). Moreover, when a dose comparison for heart minus coronary artery was calculated, the V20 and V40 for the rest of heart in all plans were very small and closed, indicating the dose to the coronary artery contributed dramatically to the high dose volumes for the entire heart. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other plans, the 2-F IMRT plan with fewer monitor units and shorter delivery time is an appropriate technique for left sided breast cancer, which achieved good PTV coverage and sparing of organs at risk besides for the heart and coronary artery."

This report details our experience of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) as a component of salvage breast conserving treatment. METHODS: Eleven patients with prior external beam radiotherapy to the breast were treated with lumpectomy and APBI using high dose rate iridium-192 to a dose of 34 gray with 10 twice-daily fractions over 5 days. Six patients were previously treated for Hodgkin disease, 4 for invasive or in situ breast cancer, and 1 for soft tissue sarcoma. All had tumor </=2 cm, negative nodes, and negative margins. RESULTS: At median follow-up of 53.7 months, 10 patients were alive without evidence of disease recurrence following treatment which occurred at median interval of 19.1 years after prior radiotherapy. One was lost to follow-up. One developed mastitis under treatment requiring oral and IV antibiotics. Another received oral antibiotics for 6 weeks following formation of a draining sinus tract with contracture and painless fibrosis. Three others reported slight to moderate firmness. Four noted mild hyperpigmentation, but none developed telangiectasia. One patient with prior whole breast radiation had necrosis requiring mastectomy 9.4 months following retreatment, with pathology revealing a chronic breast abscess. Of the 9 women with successful breast conservation, all but one reported satisfaction pursuing breast conservation rather than mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat lumpectomy and APBI for in-breast tumor recurrence after prior external beam radiotherapy has been delivered with acceptable outcomes, justifying a phase II multicenter trial for validation."

The clinical feasibility of this technique was then assessed in 9 patients who were prospectively enrolled on an Investigational Review Board-approved protocol of partial-breast irradiation. The prescribed dose was 34 Gy in 5 patients and 38.5 Gy in 4 patients, delivered in 10 fractions twice daily over 5 consecutive days. The impact of both breathing motion and patient setup uncertainty on clinical target volume (CTV) coverage was studied, and an appropriate CTV-to-PTV (planning target volume) margin was calculated. RESULTS: By adding a CTV-to-PTV breathing-only"" margin of 5 mm, 98%-100% of the CTV remained covered by the 95% isodose surface at the extremes of normal inhalation and normal exhalation. The ""total"" CTV-to-PTV margin employed to accommodate organ motion and setup error (10 mm) was found to be sufficient to accommodate the observed uncertainty in the delivery precision. Patient tolerance was excellent, and acute toxicity was minimal. No skin changes were noted during treatment, and at the initial 4-8-week follow-up visit, only mild localized hyperpigmentation and/or erythema was observed. No instances of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis have occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated partial-breast irradiation using 3D-CRT is technically feasible, and acute toxicity to date has been minimal. A CTV-to-PTV margin of 10 mm seems to provide coverage for most patients. However, more patients and additional studies will be needed to validate the accuracy of this margin, and longer follow-up will be needed to assess acute and chronic toxicity, tumor control, and cosmetic results."""

However, it has inherent challenges in daily reproducibility. Image-guide radiotherapy (IGRT) can improve daily reproducibility, allowing smaller treatment margins. Our institution proposed IG-IMRT in the prone position to evaluate dose homogeneity, conformality, normal tissue avoidance, and reliable targeting for EB-aPBI. We report preliminary results and toxicity from a phase I/II study evaluating the feasibility of EB-aPBI in the prone position using IG-IMRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty post-menopausal women with node-negative breast cancer, excised tumors <3.0 cm, negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, and surgical clips demarcating the lumpectomy cavity underwent prone EB-aPBI using IG-IMRT on an IRB-approved phase I/II study. All patients underwent CT planning in the prone position. The lumpectomy cavity PTV represented a 2.0 cm expansion. 38.5 Gy was delivered in 10 fractions over 5 days, such that 95% of the prescribed dose covered >99% of the PTV. Dose constraints for the whole breast, lungs and heart were met. RESULTS: The median patient age was 61.5. Mean tumor size was 1.0 cm. 35% of patients had DCIS. Median PTV was 243 cc (108-530) and median breast reference volume was 1698 cc (647-3627). Average daily shifts for IGRT were (0.6, -4.6, 1.7 mm) with standard deviations of (6.3, 6.5, 6.4mm). Acute toxicity was G1 erythema in 80%, and G2 erythema, G2 fatigue, and G2 breast pain each occurred in 1 patient. With a median follow-up of 18.9 months (12-35), 40% of patients have G1 fibrosis and 30% have G1 hyperpigmentation. 95% of patients have good to excellent cosmesis. There have been no recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that EB-aPBI in the prone position using IG-IMRT is well tolerated, yields good dosimetric conformality, and results in promising early toxicity profiles."

Women meeting predefined dose constraints were treated with APBI using 3 to 5 photon beams, delivering 35 to 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions, twice a day, over 1 week. Patients were assessed for treatment-related toxicities, cosmesis, and efficacy before APBI and at specified time points for as long as 3 years after APBI. RESULTS: 104 women had planning computed tomography scans showing visible seromas, met dosimetric constraints, and were treated with APBI to doses of 35 Gy (n=9), 36 Gy (n=33), or 38.5 Gy (n=62). Eighty-seven patients were evaluated with minimum 3-year follow-up after APBI. Radiation dermatitis, breast edema, breast induration, and fatigue decreased from baseline levels or stabilized by the 3-year follow-up. Hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, breast pain, and telangiectasia slightly increased from baseline levels. Most toxicities at 3 years were Grade 1. Only 1 patient had a Grade 3 toxicity with telangiectasia in a skin fold inside the 95% isodose. Cosmesis was good to excellent in 86% (89/104) of women at baseline and 82% (70/85) at 3 years. The 3-year disease-free survival was 97%, with only one local recurrence that occurred in a different quadrant away from the treated site and two distant recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 years, toxicity and cosmesis were acceptable, and local control and disease-free survival were excellent, supporting continued accrual to randomized APBI trials."

The accessible external beam technique yields unacceptable complication rates, likely from large postoperative target volumes. We designed a phase 1 trial evaluating preoperative radiation therapy to the intact tumor using widely available technology. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients received 15, 18, or 21 Gy in a single fraction to the breast tumor plus margin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used in conjunction with standard computed tomography (CT)-based planning to identify contrast enhancing tumor. Skin markers and an intratumor biopsy marker were used for verification during treatment. RESULTS: MRI imaging was critical for target delineation because not all breast tumors were reliably identified on CT scan. Breast shape differences were consistently seen between CT and MRI but did not impede image registration or tumor identification. Target volumes were markedly smaller than historical postoperative volumes, and normal tissue constraints were easily met. A biopsy marker within the breast proved sufficient for setup localization. CONCLUSIONS: This single fraction linear accelerator-based partial breast irradiation approach can be easily incorporated at most treatment centers. In vivo targeting may improve accuracy and can reduce the dose to normal tissues."

However, some treatment planning parameters, such as total dose, are not yet well defined. The Institut Gustave Roussy has initiated a dose escalation trial at the 40 Gy/10 fractions/5 days and at a further step of total dose (TD) of 42 Gy/10 fractions/ 5 days. Here, we report early results of the latest step compared with the 40 Gy dose level. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From October 2007 to March 2010, a total of 48 pT1N0 BC patients were enrolled within this clinical trial: 17 patients at a TD of 42 Gy/10f/5d and 31 at a TD of 40 Gy/10f/5d.

Toxicities were systematically assessed at 1; 2; 6 months and then every 6 months. RESULTS: Patients' recruitment of 42 Gy step was ended owing to persistent grade 3 toxicity 6 months after APBI completion (n = 1). Early toxicities were statistically higher after a total dose of 42 Gy regarding grade >/=2 dry (p = 0.01) and moist (p = 0.05) skin desquamation. Breast pain was also statistically higher in the 42 Gy step compared to 40 Gy step (p = 0.02). Other late toxicities (grade >/=2 fibrosis and telangectasia) were not statistically different between 42 Gy and 40 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: Early toxicities were more severe and higher rates of late toxicities were observed after 42 Gy/10 fractions/5 days when compared to 40 Gy/10 fractions/5 days. This data suggest that 40 Gy/10 fractions/ 5 days could potentially be the maximum tolerance for PBI although longer follow-up is warranted to better assess late toxicities."""

Nonetheless, the optimal radiation dose is not yet known. Here, we report feasibility and early toxicities of APBI delivering 40 Gy over 5 days, in a phase II trial. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From October 2007 to September 2008, 25 patients with pT1N0 cancer received 3D-conformal APBI. The prescribed radiation dose was 40 Gy in 4-Gy fractions given twice daily. This technique used two minitangents and an en face"" electron field. Toxicities were systematically assessed at 1, 2, and 6 months and then once every 6 months. RESULTS: The planning tumor volume for evaluation (PTV_EVAL) coverage was adequate: the mean dose to the PTV_EVAL was 41.8 Gy (range, 41-42.4 Gy). Mean doses to the ipsilateral lung and heart were 1.6 Gy (range, 1.0-2.3 Gy) and 1.2 Gy (range, 1.0-1.6 Gy), respectively. One and two months after completion of APBI, most patients had no or mild erythema (n=16 patients at 1 month; n=25 patients at 2 months); none of these patients developed moist desquamation.

Cosmesis with this approach has produced mixed results, and the optimal fractionation scheme remains unknown. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of APBI with a total dose of 40 Gy in 10 daily fractions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 2010 and 2014, we prospectively enrolled 106 patients to receive APBI after lumpectomy for invasive or in situ node-negative breast cancer. Radiation was administered via 3-dimensional conformal techniques. RESULTS: The median age was 62 years (range, 39-85), and all patients underwent APBI per protocol. With a median follow-up of 58 months, we evaluated patient-reported local toxicity and recurrence outcomes. Of 106 patients, 16 (15%) experienced grade >/=2 skin toxicity. The most common significant toxicities were acute cutaneous changes at 4 to 9 weeks after radiation therapy, including grade 2 erythema in 2 patients (1.8%) and skin color changes in 4 patients (3.8%). Only 2 instances of grade 3 toxicity were reported, including 1 patient with acute moist desquamation after radiation therapy and another with fibrosis at 2 years. Planning target volume and breast V20 were significantly predictive of skin/subcutaneous toxicity, with evidence that limiting breast V20 to <45% may improve tolerability. Overall, 3 breast cancer recurrences arose: 1 local recurrence in the original quadrant (3 years after APBI), 1 in a different ipsilateral quadrant (5 years after APBI), and 1 with distant disease 2 years after APBI. CONCLUSIONS: In an appropriately selected group of patients with early stage breast cancer, APBI to a dose of 40 Gy in 10 daily fractions was well tolerated, with most patients (99%) reporting excellent/good cosmesis. Planning target volume and breast V20 should be carefully constrained to limit local morbidity. Longer follow-up will be needed to establish efficacy and subsequent local recurrence rates."

Toxicity and cosmesis were assessed by the patient (P), the radiation oncologist (RO), and the surgical oncologist (SO) at 3, 6, and 12 months from the completion of treatment and then annually. National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, was used to grade toxicity. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were evaluable. Median follow-up was 5.3 years (range, 1.7-6.4 years). Eighty-two percent of patients rated their cosmesis as good/excellent at 1 year, with rates of 64% at 3 years. At 3 years, 31 patients were satisfied with the treatment, 5 were not satisfied but would choose 3D-CRT again, and none would choose standard radiation therapy. The worst adverse event (AE) per patient reported as definitely, probably, or possibly related to radiation therapy was 36.5% grade 1, 50% grade 2, and 5.8% grade 3 events. Grade 3 AEs were all skin or musculoskeletal-related. Treatment-related factors were evaluated to potentially establish an association with observed toxicity. Surgical bed volume, target volume, the number of beams used, and the use of bolus were not associated with late cosmesis. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients enrolled in RTOG 0319 were satisfied with their treatment, and all would choose to have the 3D-CRT APBI again."

E.",2012,Video surface image guidance for external beam partial breast irradiation,,1,322,eng,"OBJECTIVE: Accelerated partial breast irradiation is an emerging treatment option for early stage breast cancer. With accelerated partial breast irradiation, patient setup, and target registration accuracy is vital. The current study compared various methods for isocenter placement accuracy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-three patients treated on an institutional-approved partial breast irradiation protocol were monitored at each treatment fraction. All patients included in this study underwent clip placement at the time of surgery. Patients underwent computed tomographic simulation and surface contours were used to reconstruct a reference surface map. At the treatment machine, patients were initially positioned by laser alignment to tattoos. Orthogonal kilovoltage imaging of the chest wall, followed by video surface mapping of the breast, was performed. This video surface map was matched to the reference surface map to adjust the couch position. Verification orthogonal chest wall imaging and video surface mapping was again performed. The accuracy of setup by laser, orthogonal imaging of the chest wall, and surface alignment was retrospectively compared using the centroid clip position as the reference standard. The impact of setup error by surface alignment and by orthogonal kilovoltage imaging on planning target volume coverage was then calculated. RESULTS: Laser-based positioning resulted in a residual setup error of 3.9 +/- 3.7 mm, 4.6 +/- 3.9 mm, and 4.3 +/- 4.5 mm in the posterior-anterior (P-A), inferior-superior (I-S), and left-right (L-R) directions, respectively, using clips as the reference standard. Setup based on bony anatomy with orthogonal imaging resulted in residual setup error of 3.2 +/- 2.9 (P-A), 4.2 +/- 3.5 (I-S), and 4.7 +/- 5.3 mm (L-R). Setup with video surface mapping resulted in a residual setup error of 1.9 +/- 2.2, 1.8 +/- 1.9, and 1.8 +/- 2.1 mm in the P-A, I-S, and L-R directions, respectively. Vector spatial deviation was 8.8 +/- 4.2, 8.3 +/- 3.8, and 4.0 +/- 2.3 mm with laser, chest wall on board imaging, and video surface mapping based setup, respectively. Setup by video surface mapping resulted in improved dosimetric coverage of the planning target volume when compared with orthogonal imaging of the chest wall (V100 96.0% +/- 0.1% vs 89.3% +/- 0.2%; V95 99.7% +/- 0.01% vs 98.6% +/- 0.01%, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Video surface mapping of the breast is a more accurate method for isocenter placement in comparison to conventional laser-based alignment or orthogonal kilovoltage imaging of the chest wall."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients diagnosed with breast cancer were treated with PB-APBI using a single-field proton beam or two fields after BCS. The treatment dose was 30 cobalt gray equivalent (CGE) in six CGE fractions delivered once daily over five consecutive working days. RESULTS: All patients completed PB-APBI. The median follow-up time was 59 months (range: 43-70 months). Of the 30 patients, none had ipsilateral breast recurrence or regional or distant metastasis, and all were alive at the last follow-up. Physician-evaluated toxicities were mild to moderate, except in one patient who had severe wet desquamation at 2 months that was not observed beyond 6 months. Qualitative physician cosmetic assessments of good or excellent were noted in 83% and 80% of the patients at the end of PB-APBI and at 2 months, respectively, and decreased to 69% at 3 years. A good or excellent cosmetic outcome was noted in all patients treated with a two-field proton beam at any follow-up time point except for one. For all patients, the mean percentage breast retraction assessment (pBRA) value increased significantly during the follow-up period (p=0.02); however, it did not increase in patients treated with two-field PB-APBI (p=0.3). CONCLUSIONS: PB-APBI consisting of 30 CGE in six CGE fractions once daily for five consecutive days can be delivered with excellent disease control and tolerable skin toxicity to properly selected patients with early-stage breast cancer. Multiple-field PB-APBI may achieve a high rate of good-to-excellent cosmetic outcomes. Additional clinical trials with larger patient groups are needed."

Aim: To investigate whether single dose accelerated partial breast (APBI) to the intact tumor in both the prone and supine radiotherapy positions on the MRI-linac is dosimetrically feasible with respect to predefined coverage and organs at risk (OAR) constraints. Material & methods: For 20 patients with cTis or low-risk cT1N0M0 non-lobular breast carcinoma, previously treated with single dose preoperative APBI in the supine (n=10) or prone (n=10) position, additional intensity modulated radiotherapy plans with 7 coplanar beams in the presence of a 1.5T magnetic field were generated. A 20Gy and 15Gy dose was prescribed to the gross tumor and clinical target volume, respectively. The percentage of plans achieving predefined organ at risk (OAR) constraints, currently used in clinical practice, was assessed. Dosimetry differences between the prone versus supine approach and the MRI-linac versus clinically delivered plans were evaluated. Results: All MRI-linac plans met the coverage and predefined OAR constraints. The prone approach appeared to be more favorable with respect to the chest wall, and ipsilateral lung dose compared to the supine position. No dosimetric differences were observed for the ipsilateral breast. No treatment position was clearly more beneficial for the skin or heart, since dosimetry varied among parameters. Overall, the MRI-linac and clinical plans were comparable, with minor absolute dosimetric differences. Conclusion: MRI-linac based single dose APBI to the intact tumor is a promising and a dosimetrically feasible strategy in patients with low-risk breast cancer. Preliminary OAR dosimetry favored the prone radiotherapy position."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2014 and June 2017, all breast cancer patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in a prospective study conducted at a tertiary cancer centre in North India. All patients received adjuvant radiotherapy by simultaneous integrated boost technique following breast conserving surgery. Clinical information including patient and pathological characteristics, observed acute and chronic toxicities along with cosmesis using Harvard score were recorded and analysed. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed for those variables which were found to be significant (p<0.050) to study the influence of clinicopathological and dosimetric factors on toxicity and cosmetic outcome. RESULTS: Maximum acute skin toxicity during treatment was Grade 0-1 in 68.2% and Grade 2-3 in 31.8% of cases, respectively. Fibrosis was the commonest late toxicity with >/=Grade II fibrosis being noted in 16.3% of cases. Assessment of global cosmesis at 12months follow-up showed good/excellent cosmesis in 88.4% of cases. Mean age, tumor size and homogeneity index (HI) were the significant factors associated with fair or poor cosmetic outcome and >/=Grade 2 fibrosis on multivariate analysis. Telengectasia and breast edema were more frequent in patients with larger tumor size/GTV volume. There were 5 recurrences including 1 ipsilateral local breast tumor recurrence. CONCLUSION: SIB-IMRT is a dosimetrically feasible option in patients undergoing breast conserving surgery and provides good/excellent cosmetic outcome."

Planning CT in the prone position was performed on a dedicated table. The postoperative cavity was defined as the clinical target volume, with a 1.5-cm margin added to determine the planning target volume. A total dose of 30 Gy at 6 Gy/fraction was delivered in five fractions within 10 days. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 67.5 years (range, 51-88 years). The median tumor diameter was 9 mm (range, 1.3-19 mm). In all patients, the prescribed dose encompassed the planning target volume. The mean volume of the ipsilateral breast receiving 100% of the prescription dose was 26% (range, 10-45%), and the mean volume contained within the 50% isodose surface was 47% (range, 23-75%). The lung and heart were spared by treating in the prone position. Acute toxicity was modest, limited mainly to Grade 1-2 erythema. With a median follow-up of 18 months, only Grade 1 late toxicity occurred, and no patient developed local recurrence.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Postmenopausal patients with Stage I breast cancer with nonpalpable tumors <2 cm, negative margins and negative nodes, positive hormone receptors, and no extensive intraductal component were eligible. The trial was offered only after eligible patients had refused to undergo standard whole-breast radiotherapy. Patients were simulated and treated on a dedicated table for prone setup. 3D-CRT was delivered at a dose of 30 Gy in five 6-Gy/day fractions over 10 days with port film verification at each treatment. Rates of ipsilateral breast failure, ipsilateral nodal failure, contralateral breast failure, and distant failure were estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Rates of disease-free, overall, and cancer-specific survival were recorded. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled in this institutional review board-approved prospective trial, one with bilateral breast cancer. One patient withdrew consent after simulation, and another patient elected to interrupt radiotherapy after receiving two treatments. Ninety-eight patients were evaluable for toxicity, and, in 1 case, both breasts were treated with partial breast irradiation. Median patient age was 68 years (range, 53-88 years); in 55% of patients the tumor size was <1 cm. All patients had hormone receptor-positive cancers: 87% of patients underwent adjuvant antihormone therapy. At a median follow-up of 64 months (range, 2-125 months), there was one local recurrence (1% ipsilateral breast failure) and one contralateral breast cancer (1% contralateral breast failure). There were no deaths due to breast cancer by 5 years. Grade 3 late toxicities occurred in 2 patients (one breast edema, one transient breast pain). Cosmesis was rated good/excellent in 89% of patients with at least 36 months follow-up.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From October 2003 to April 2006, 98 evaluable patients with stage I breast cancer were treated with APBI (32 Gy in 8 fractions given twice daily) on a prospective clinical trial: 19 with proton beam therapy (PBT) and 79 with photons or mixed photons/electrons. Median follow-up was 82.5 months (range, 2-104 months). Toxicity and patient satisfaction evaluations were performed at each visit. RESULTS: At 7 years, the physician rating of overall cosmesis was good or excellent for 62% of PBT patients, compared with 94% for photon patients (P=.03). Skin toxicities were more common for the PBT group: telangiectasia, 69% and 16% (P=.0013); pigmentation changes, 54% and 22% (P=.02); and other late skin toxicities, 62% and 18% (P=.029) for PBT and photons, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidences of breast pain, edema, fibrosis, fat necrosis, skin desquamation, and rib pain or fracture. Patient-reported cosmetic outcomes at 7 years were good or excellent for 92% and 96% of PBT and photon patients, respectively (P=.95). Overall patient satisfaction was 93% for the entire cohort. The 7-year local failure rate for all patients was 6%, with 3 local recurrences in the PBT group (7-year rate, 11%) and 2 in photon-treated patients (4%) (P=.22). CONCLUSIONS: Local failure rates of 3-dimensional APBI and PBT were similar in this study. However, PBT, as delivered in this study, led to higher rates of long-term telangiectasia, skin color changes, and skin toxicities. We recommend the use of multiple fields and treatment of all fields per treatment session or the use of scanning techniques to minimize skin toxicity."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 84 patients were treated with 3D-CRT for APBI. This technique was assessed in patients with low risk stage I breast cancer enrolled from September 2005 to July 2011. The prescribed dose was 34/38.5 Gy delivered in 10 fractions twice daily over 5 consecutive days. Four to five no-coplanar 6 MV beams were used. In all CT scans Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was defined around the surgical clips. A 1.5 cm margin was added by defining a Clinical Target Volume (CTV). A margin of 1 cm was added to CTV to define the planning target volume (PTV). The dose-volume constraints were followed in accordance with the NSABP/RTOG protocol. Late toxicity was evaluated according to the RTOG grading schema. The cosmetic assessment was performed using the Harvard scale. RESULTS: Median patient age was 66 years (range 51-87). Median follow-up was 36.5 months (range 13-83). The overall incidence of acute skin toxicities was 46.4% for grade 1 and 1% for grade 2. The incidence of late toxicity was 16.7% for grade 1, 2.4% for grade 2 and 3.6% for grade 3. No grade 4 toxicity was observed. The most pronounced grade 2 late toxicity was telangiectasia, developed in three patients. Cosmetics results were excellent for 52%, good for 42%, fair for 5% and poor for 1% of the patients. There was no statistical correlation between toxicity rates and prescribed doses (p = 0.33) or irradiated volume (p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: APBI using 3D-CRT is technically feasible with very low acute and late toxicity. Long-term results are needed to assess its efficacy in reducing the incidence of breast relapse."

Using the concept of target registration error (TRE), the performance of several methods of target localization was compared. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve patients who underwent external beam accelerated partial breast irradiation were included in this study. TRE was quantified for four methods of image guidance: standard laser-based setup, kilovoltage imaging of the chest wall, kilovoltage imaging of surgically implanted clips, and three-dimensional surface imaging of the breast. The use of a reference surface created from a free-breathing computed tomography scan and a reference surface directly captured with three-dimensional video imaging were compared. The effects of respiratory motion were also considered, and gating was used for 8 of 12 patients. RESULTS: The median value of the TRE for the laser, chest wall, and clip alignment was 7.1 mm (n=94), 5.4 mm (n=81), and 2.4 mm (n=93), respectively. The median TRE for gated surface imaging based on the first fraction reference surface was 3.2 mm (n=49), and the TRE for gated surface imaging using the computed tomography-based reference surface was 4.9 mm (n=56). The TRE for nongated surface imaging using the first fraction reference surface was 6.2 mm (n=25). CONCLUSIONS: The TRE of surface imaging using a reference surface directly captured with three-dimensional video and the TRE for clip-based setup were within 1 mm. Gated capture is important for surface imaging to reduce the effects of respiratory motion in accelerated partial breast irradiation."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Node-negative breast cancer patients after breast conserving surgery with clear excision margins, with physician-assessed excellent or good baseline cosmesis were invited to participate in a prospective clinical trial to receive 27 Gy in 5 daily fractions to the expanded primary site. Clinical photographs and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer cosmetic score were collected at baseline prior to RT and 1-year after radiation therapy. A protocol-specified, interim analysis was scheduled when 50 patients had completed 1-year follow-up. A panel of 6 physicians provided a consensus global cosmetic score (termed panel-assessed score) based on clinical photographs at baseline and 1-year. Fibrosis and telangiectasia were prospectively assessed by clinical research staff at clinic visits. RESULTS: At the interim analysis, 55 patients had baseline and 1-year post-RT images available. Most patients had either an improvement (53%) or no change (40%) in cosmesis from baseline to 1-year. Among 49 patients with excellent or good panel-assessed score at baseline, only 2 (4%) patients had a fair score at 1-year post-RT, indicating cosmetic deterioration. No patients had evidence of telangiectasia or grade 2 or higher fibrosis. There were no recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: APBI using 27 Gy in 5 daily fractions achieved acceptable 1-year cosmesis and no grade 2 fibrosis. A preplanned stopping rule of 5% grade 2+ fibrosis was not observed.

Methods of delivery include interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy, and 3D conformal irradiation, although the least amount of data exists on 3D conformal. Despite the relative paucity of data on 3D conformal, it is the most common method delivered on the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-39 trial. To date, minimal toxicities and good cosmetic results have been associated with accelerated partial breast irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIAL: In this case study, we present a 64-year-old female patient, diagnosed with Grade 1 tubular carcinoma, who developed both expected and unexpected toxicities after 3D conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation. DISCUSSION/RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Along with chest wall pain, she developed hyperpigmentation of the skin as well as fibrosis of the skin, pectoralis minor, and pectoralis major. The fibrosis she developed limited her comfortable range of motion in the ipsilateral arm. She also developed symptomatic fractures of the fourth and fifth ribs in the anterior axillary line. Upon fusing the treatment-planning CT with a diagnostic CT, it was evident that the rib fractures fell within the 100% isodose line of the 3D conformal plan."

METHODS: A total of 38 patients met the inclusion criteria and an accelerated partial breast intensity-modulated radiotherapy (APBI-IMRT) plan was designed for each patient. The prescription dose was 34 Gy in 10 fractions, 3.4 Gy per fraction, twice a day, in intervals of more than 6 hours. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients, six patients did not meet the planning criteria. The remaining 32 patients received APBI-IMRT with a mean target volume conformity index of 0.67 and a dose homogeneity index of 1.06. The median follow-up time was 53 months and no local recurrence or distant metastasis was detected. The most common acute toxicities observed within 3 months after radiotherapy were erythema, breast edema, pigmentation, and pain in the irradiated location, among which 43.8%, 12.5%, 31.3%, and 28.1% were grade 1 toxicities, respectively. The most common late toxicities occurring after 3 months until the end of the follow-up period were breast edema, pigmentation, pain in the irradiated location, and subcutaneous fibrosis, among which 6.2%, 28.1%, 21.9%, and 37.5% were grade 1 toxicities, respectively. Thirty-one patients (96.8%) had fine or excellent cosmetic outcomes, and only one patient had a poor cosmetic outcome. CONCLUSION: It is feasible for Chinese females to receive APBI-IMRT after breast conserving surgery. The radiotherapeutic toxicity is acceptable, and both the initial efficacy and cosmetic outcomes are good."

This study presents the results of a prospective trial evaluating 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to deliver APBI for early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: Patients with unifocal stage 0-II breast cancer measuring </=2.5 cm without lymph node involvement were eligible. After lumpectomy, 3D-CRT APBI was delivered to the lumpectomy cavity + margin (34-38.5 Gy in 10 fractions over 5 days). RESULTS: 141 patients with 143 breast cancers (2 bilateral) were treated with 3D-CRT APBI. Median age was 60. Median tumor size was 1.1 cm. At a median follow up of 60 months (range, 5-113), the 5-year and 8-year cumulative incidence rate of a true recurrence is 0.9%. The 5-year and 8-year cumulative incidence rates of an elsewhere failure are 2.4% and 4.4%, respectively. The 5-year and 8-year overall survival is 100% and 94%, respectively.

The patients were treated on a home-made treatment table top that allows the breast to hang down. A particular immobilization system was introduced in order to assure the reproducibility of patient positioning between the CT acquisition session and the treatment session. The clinical target volume (CTV) was outlined according to surgical clips position and/or tumor location on preoperative mammography. Because of negligible movement due to respiration, only an additional margin of 3 mm was added to obtain the planning target volume (PTV). Based on radiobiological calculations, a dose of 21 Gy was prescribed to PTV. The tumor bed was treated with 3D-CRT technique by using 5 fields and rotating the table while the gantry was approximately 90 or 270 degrees. Thirty patients were enrolled for this study chosen in conformity to an approved clinical protocol. The average percentage of PTV volume enclosed in the 90% and 95% of prescribed dose were 99.9 and 98.6% respectively, while only 3.4% of PTV volume received more than 105% of prescribed dose. Dose to 3% of skin volume was, on average, 15.2 Gy. In 97% of patients, less than 50% of the ipsilateral breast received a dose greater than half the prescribed dose. Mean doses to lungs, heart and contralateral breast were negligible. With a median follow-up of 9 months, no important early toxicity was observed both for skin and breast tissue. The treatment of breast tumor bed in prone position in only one session by using the 3D-CRT is technically feasible and seems to be a promising alternative to other accelerated partial breast irradiation techniques."

We seek to address these concerns by reporting our experience of 3D-CRT APBI with extended follow-up. METHODS: All patients treated with APBI delivered with 3D-CRT from January 2006 through December 2012 at a single institution were identified. Those with more than a year of follow-up were analyzed for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), progression-free survival (PFS), cosmesis, and pain. Disease outcomes were analyzed by margin status (<2 mm, >/=2 mm), total radiation dose prescribed, presence of invasive disease, and American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2016 updated consensus groupings (suitable, cautionary, and unsuitable). RESULTS: 293 patients were identified, of which 266 had >1 year of follow-up. Median follow-up was 87 months (range: 13-156). Of the 266, 162 (60.9%) were ASTRO suitable,"" 87 (32.7%) were ""cautionary,"" and 17 (6.4%) were ""unsuitable."" Seven-year rates of IBTR and PFS were 1.8% and 95.2%, respectively. Margin status, invasive versus in-situ disease, prescribed dose, and ASTRO grouping were not prognostic for either IBTR or PFS on univariate analysis. Cosmesis was good to excellent in 75.2%. Two patients (0.8%) had subsequent plastic surgery due to poor cosmesis. Narcotic medication for treatment site pain was needed by 6 (2.3%). CONCLUSION: External beam APBI results in excellent long-term disease control. Good-to-excellent cosmetic outcomes are achieved in most patients, although increasing dose per fraction as well as greater percentage of irradiated breast were predictive of adverse post-treatment cosmetic outcomes. Select patients in ""cautionary"" and ""unsuitable"" consensus groupings do not appear to have inferior outcomes."""

HIP was implemented to merge the schedule of once-daily breast hypofractionation with partial breast treatment. METHODS: We identified 38 breast cancers in 37 patients from 2013 to 2014 treated at our institution with HIP following lumpectomy for early stage breast cancer. Patients received a hypo-fractionated course (</= 20 fractions) of once daily radiation to the partial breast (lumpectomy cavity + margin) utilizing DIBH regardless of laterality. Clinical and treatment-related characteristics were obtained, including target volume and organ at risk (OAR) dosimetric characteristics. Patients were followed clinically and with at least yearly mammograms for up to 36 months (range 5-36 months). Acute and late toxicity was scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03. RESULTS: Patients received a median dose of 42.56 Gy in 16 Fractions (Fx) (range 40.05-53.2 Gy; and 15-20 Fx). OAR doses were low, with a mean heart dose of 0.37 Gy, an ipsilateral lung V20 mean of 4%, and a contralateral lung V5 of 1%. Acute toxicity (</= grade 2) was present in 79% (n = 30) of the cases, with dermatitis being the most common finding (63%). Late grade 1-2 toxicity was present in 42% (n = 16) of the cases, with hyperpigmentation being the most common finding (n = 9). There were no severe acute or late toxicities (>/= grade 3). At a median follow up of 21 months, there were no local, regional, or distant failures. CONCLUSIONS: We report limited toxicity in this low risk cohort of patients with early stage breast cancer treated with HIP, a unique and logical combination of 3-D conformal external beam radiotherapy, moderate hypo-fractionation, and DIBH."""

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with Stage I breast cancer were treated with proton 3D-CPBI in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Patients were followed at 3 to 4 weeks, 6 to 8 weeks, 6 months, and every 6 months thereafter for recurrent disease, cosmetic outcome, toxicity, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 8-22 months), no recurrent disease has been detected. Global breast cosmesis was judged by physicians to be good or excellent in 89% and 100% of cases at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. Patients rated global breast cosmesis as good or excellent in 100% of cases at both 6 and 12 months. Proton 3D-CPBI produced significant acute skin toxicity with moderate to severe skin color changes in 79% of patients at 3 to 4 weeks and moderate to severe moist desquamation in 22% of patients at 6 to 8 weeks. Telangiectasia was noted in 3 patients. Three patients reported rib tenderness in the treated area, and one rib fracture was documented. At last follow-up, 95% of patients reported total satisfaction with proton 3D-CPBI. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study results, proton 3D-CPBI offers good-to-excellent cosmetic outcomes in 89% to 100% of patients at 6-month and 12-month follow-up and nearly universal patient satisfaction. However, proton 3D-CPBI, as used in this study, does result in significant acute skin toxicity and may potentially be associated with late skin (telangiectasia) and rib toxicity. Because of the dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI, technique modifications are being explored to improve acute skin tolerance."

A feasibility study of accelerated PBI delivered using external beam 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (RT) was undertaken at 8 Australasian centers. The present study evaluated the impact of patient, tumor, and RT technique-related factors on the quality of RT plans as determined by the dose-volume parameters of organs at risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. All RT plans were centrally reviewed using predefined dosimetric criteria before commencement and after completion of protocol therapy. The RT plans of 47 patients met the dose-volume constraints, and all 47 patients received PBI to a prescribed dose of 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions. The RT plan quality was determined by volumes of the ipsilateral whole breast, lung, and heart that received 50% and 95%; 30%; and 5% of the prescribed dose, respectively. Patient, tumor, and RT technique-related factors were investigated for association with the parameters of RT plan quality. RESULTS: The ratio of the planning target volume to the ipsilateral whole-breast volume was significantly associated with the ipsilateral breast doses on multiple variable analyses. The distance of the postlumpectomy surgical cavity from the heart and lung were predictive for heart and lung doses, respectively. A distance between surgical cavity and heart of >4 cm typically resulted in <1% of the heart volume receiving 5 Gy or less. It was more difficult to meet the heart dose constraint for left-sided and medially located tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Partial breast irradiation using 3-dimensional conformal RT was feasible within the study constraints. The ratio of planning target volume to ipsilateral whole-breast volume and the distance of surgical cavity from the heart were significant predictors of the quality of treatment plan for external beam PBI."

All patients were treated in 10 equal fractions delivered twice daily within 5 consecutive days. The first 7 patients were treated to 34 Gy, and the remaining 48 patients were treated to 38.5 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up after IMRT was 10 months (range, <1-19) and after diagnosis was 11.5 months (range, 2-21). No local or distant recurrences developed. The T stage distribution was as follows: T1a in 11 patients, T1b in 24, and T1c in 20. The median tumor size was 9 mm (range, 1-20 mm).

Breast pain, as judged by patient, was none in 34, mild in 19, moderate in 2, and severe in 0 patients. There was a single report of telangiectasia but no incidents of significant edema. Compared with historic controls for whom three-dimensional treatment planning techniques were used, IMRT provided similar dose delivery to the target while reducing the volume of normal breast included in the 100%, 75%, and 50% isodose lines. CONCLUSION: This initial report prospectively explored the feasibility of accelerated partial breast IMRT. After short-term follow-up, the dose delivery and clinical outcomes were very acceptable.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty patients were treated by the use of 3D-CRT to deliver APBI at our institutions from 2003-2010 in strict accordance with the specified dose-volume constraints outlined in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B39/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0413 (NSABP-B39/RTOG 0413) protocol. The prescribed dose was 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions delivered twice daily. Patients underwent follow-up with assessment for recurrence, late toxicity, and overall cosmetic outcome. Tests for association between toxicity endpoints and dosimetric parameters were performed with the chi-square test. Univariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of interfraction interval (IFI) with these outcomes. RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 32 months, grade 2-4 and grade 3-4 subcutaneous fibrosis occurred in 31% and 7.5% of patients, respectively. Subcutaneous fibrosis improved in 5 patients (6%) with extended follow-up. Fat necrosis developed in 11% of women, and cosmetic outcome was fair/poor in 19%. The relative volume of breast tissue receiving 5%, 20%, 50%, 80%, and 100% (V5-V100) of the prescribed dose was associated with risk of subcutaneous fibrosis, and the volume receiving 50%, 80%, and 100% (V50-V100) was associated with fair/poor cosmesis. The mean IFI was 6.9 hours, and the minimum IFI was 6.2 hours. The mean and minimum IFI values were not significantly associated with late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of moderate to severe late toxicity, particularly subcutaneous fibrosis and fat necrosis and resulting fair/poor cosmesis, remains high with continued follow-up. These toxicity endpoints are associated with several dose-volume parameters. Minimum and mean IFI values were not associated with late toxicity."

Grade 1 and 2 late toxicities as edema, fibrosis, and residual hyperpigmentation occurred in 14% and 11% of patients, respectively; Grade 3 telangiectasis was observed in 3% of patients. The overall cosmetic outcome was considered excellent"" or ""good"" by 94% of patients and 97% when rated by the physician, respectively. The local control rate was 97%; 1 patient died of a non-cancer-related cause. CONCLUSIONS: APBI can be safely and effectively administered using IMRT. In retrospective analysis, IMRT enabled the achievement of normal tissue dose constraints as outlined by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 04-13/NSABP B-13 while providing excellent conformality for the CTV. Local control and cosmesis have remained excellent at current follow-up, with acceptable rates of acute/late toxicities. Our data suggest that cosmesis is dependent on target volume size. Further prospective multi-institutional trials should be performed to evaluate IMRT to deliver APBI."""

But APBI can be only used in selected population of patients with early-staged breast cancer. It is not replacing the whole breast radiotherapy. This study aimed to examine the feasibility and acute normal tissue toxicity of the APBI-3DCRT technique in Chinese female patients who generally have smaller breasts compared to their Western counterparts. METHODS: From May 2006 to December 2009, a total of 48 Chinese female patients (with early-stage breast cancer who met the inclusion criteria) received APBI-3DCRT after breast-conserving surgery at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. The total dosage from APBI-3DCRT was 34 Gy, delivered in 3.4 Gy per fractions, twice per day at intervals of at least six hours. The radiation dose, volume of the target area and volume of irradiated normal tissues were calculated. Acute toxicity was evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) 3.0. RESULTS: Among the 48 patients, the planning target volume for evaluation (PTVE) was (90.42 +/- 9.26) cm(3), the ipsilateral breast volume (IBV) was (421.74 +/- 28.53) cm(3), and the ratio between the two was (20.74 +/- 5.86)%. Evaluation of the dosimetric characteristics of the PTVE revealed excellent dosimetric results in 14 patients and acceptable results in 34 patients. The dose delivered to the PTVE ranged from 93% to 110% of the prescribed dose. The average ratio of the volume of PTVE receiving 95% of the prescription dose (V95) was (99.26 +/- 0.37)%. The habituation index (HI) and the conformity index (CI) were 1.08 +/- 0.01 and 0.72 +/- 0.02, respectively, suggesting good homogeneity and conformity of the dose delivered to the target field. The radiation dose to normal tissues and organs was within the dose limitation. Subjects experienced mild acute toxicity. The main manifestations were breast edema in 22 patients, breast pain in 7, skin erythema in 25, general malaise in 22 and cytopenia in 8. No acute radiological cardiac or pulmonary injury was found. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our short-term follow-up showed that it is feasible to perform APBI-3DCRT for early-stage breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery in Chinese female patients with smaller breasts. However, further studies are required to elucidate its efficacy and long-term side effects."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Women older than 40 with breast cancer stages 0-I who received breast-conserving surgery were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved prospective study evaluating APBI using IMRT administered with deep inspiration breath-hold. Patients received 38.5 Gy in 3.85-Gy fractions given twice daily over 5 consecutive days. The planning target volume was defined as the lumpectomy cavity with a 1.5-cm margin. Cosmesis was scored on a 4-category scale by the treating physician. Toxicity was scored according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 3.0). We report the cosmetic and toxicity results at a median follow-up of 5 years. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were enrolled. Two patients were excluded because of fair baseline cosmesis. The trial was terminated early because fair/poor cosmesis developed in 7 of 32 women at a median follow-up of 2.5 years. At a median follow-up of 5 years, further decline in the cosmetic outcome was observed in 5 women. Cosmesis at the time of last assessment was 43.3% excellent, 30% good, 20% fair, and 6.7% poor. Fibrosis according to CTCAE at last assessment was 3.3% grade 2 toxicity and 0% grade 3 toxicity. There was no correlation of CTCAE grade 2 or greater fibrosis with cosmesis. The 5-year rate of local control was 97% for all 34 patients initially enrolled. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective trial with 5-year median follow-up, we observed an excellent rate of tumor control using IMRT-planned APBI. Cosmetic outcomes, however, continued to decline, with 26.7% of women having a fair to poor cosmetic result. These results underscore the need for continued cosmetic assessment for patients treated with APBI by technique."

Treatment was performed with the 6 MV beam from one of the Elekta Precise LINAC units installed in our Department. The prescribed dose was 30 Gy in 5 fractions in 10 days. RESULTS: Acute toxicity was minimal. No skin changes were noted during treatment or during the first 6 months after radiotherapy treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated partial breast irradiation using intensity-modulated external radiotherapy is technically feasible. We think the approach will give good results in terms of local control, toxicity and quality of life, at the same time sparing resources for the patient and health care system."

Associations between cosmetic outcomes and treatment parameters or receipt of adjuvant systemic therapy were sought to guide 3DCRT APBI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An analysis of cosmetic outcomes among patients treated with 3DCRT APBI at Moffitt Cancer Center was performed. Overall cosmesis was evaluated using modified Harvard criteria and toxicity outcomes were graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Patients were treated to 38.5 Gy in 3.85 Gy twice daily fractions per dose-volume objectives specified in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel B-39/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0413 (NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413) trial. RESULTS: At least 1 evaluation was available for 97 treated breasts (94 women) with median follow-up of 17.2 months (range, 1-60 months). Most breasts (90.7%) had grade 1 to 2 (excellent to good) overall cosmesis. Nine breasts (9.3%) had grade 3 to 4 (fair to poor) overall cosmesis, secondary to >25% asymmetry in 5 patients, grade 3 fibrosis in 3 patients, and fat necrosis in 1 patient. Increasing percentage of ipsilateral breast volume receiving more than 50% of the prescription dose (V50%) correlated with less than excellent cosmesis (P < .001), with a threshold V50% of 40%. Telangiectasia formation (6%) correlated with increased evaluation planning target volume (P = .006) and V50% (P = .017). Grade 2+ fibrosis (18%) and grade 1+ induration (83%) were also correlated with increasing V50% (P = .006 and .002, respectively). Smaller ipsilateral breast volume correlated with worsening cosmesis (P = .048) and induration (P = .028). Two of 4 patients receiving chemotherapy developed grade 3 fibrosis (P = .004) and fair/poor cosmesis (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis implies that acceptable cosmetic results are achievable with 3DCRT APBI technique by adhering to optimal radiation therapy dose-volume constraints, particularly ipsilateral breast V50%."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 2011 and March 2014, 60 patients with low-risk early invasive breast cancer underwent BCS and were enrolled in this phase II prospective study. The total dose was 36.9 Gy (9 fractions of 4.1 Gy, two fractions/day). Patient setup errors were detected in LAT, LONG and VERT directions. Local tumour control, survival results, early and late side effects and cosmetic outcome were assessed. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 39 months, all patients were alive and neither locoregional nor distant failure occurred. One contralateral breast cancer and two new primary malignancies outside the breast were observed. No grade (G) 3-4 acute toxicity was detected. G1 and G2 erythema occurred in 21 (35%) and 2 (3.3%) patients, respectively; while G1 oedema was observed in 23 (38.8%) cases. G1 and G2 pain was reported by 6 (10%) and 2 (3.3%) patients, respectively.

CONCLUSION: IG-IMRT is a reproducible and feasible technique for delivery of external beam APBI following BCS for treatment of low-risk, early-stage invasive breast carcinoma. In order to avoid toxicity, image guidance performed before each radiation fraction is necessary to minimize the PTV. Three-year results are promising, early and late radiation side-effects are minimal, and cosmetic results are excellent to good."

The goal was to validate the use of intraparenchymal textured gold fiducials in patients receiving APBI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-six patients were enrolled on this prospective study that had three or four textured gold intraparenchymal fiducials placed at the periphery of the lumpectomy cavity and were treated with three-dimensional (3D) conformal APBI. Free-breathing four-dimensional computed tomography image sets were obtained pre- and posttreatment, as were daily online megavoltage (MV) orthogonal images. Intrafraction motion, variations in respiratory motion, and fiducial marker migration were calculated using the 3D coordinates of individual fiducials and a calculated center of mass (COM) of the fiducials. We also compared the relative position of the fiducial COM with the geometric center of the seroma. RESULTS: There was less than 1 mm of intrafraction respiratory motion, variation in respiratory motion, or fiducial marker migration. The change in seroma position relative to the fiducial COM was 1 mm +/- 1 mm. The average position of the geometric seroma relative to the fiducial COM pretreatment compared with posttreatment was 1 mm +/- 1 mm. The largest daily variation in displacement when using bony landmark was in the anteroposterior direction and two standard deviations (SD) of this variation was 10 mm. The average variation in daily separation between the fiducial pairs from daily MV images was 3 mm +/- 3 mm therefore 2 SD is 6 mm. CONCLUSION: Fiducial markers are stable throughout the course of APBI. Planning target volume margins when using bony landmarks should be 10 mm and can be reduced to 6 mm if using fiducials."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2001 to February 2009, 53 patients with Stage 0 breast cancer were treated with breast conserving surgery and adjuvant APBI. Median age was 62 years. All patients underwent excision with margins negative by >/=1 mm before adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). A total of 39 MammoSite brachytherapy (MS) patients and 14 three-dimensional conformal external beam RT (3DCRT) patients were treated to the lumpectomy bed alone with 34 Gy and 38.5 Gy, respectively. Of the DCIS cases, 94% were mammographically detected. All patients with calcifications had either specimen radiography or postsurgical mammography confirmation of clearance. Median tumor size was 6 mm, and median margin distance was 5 mm. There were no statistically significant differences according to APBI method for race/ethnicity, tumor detection method, tumor grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, or use of tamoxifen (p = NS). Recurrence and survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cosmesis was scored by the Harvard criteria. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 0.4-6.3 years), the overall and cause-specific survival rates were 98% and 100%, respectively. Three-year actuarial ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was 2%. One failure was observed at the resection bed 11 months post-RT. No other elsewhere breast failures, regional recurrences, or distant metastases were noted. Cosmesis was excellent or good in 92.4% of cases, with no statistically significant differences according to the APBI method (92.3% with MammoSite and 92.8% with 3DCRT; p = 0.649). CONCLUSIONS: APBI as part of breast-conserving therapy for pure DCIS was associated with excellent local control and survival rates, with the vast majority of patients having good to excellent cosmesis. This finding supports the recent analysis by the American Society of Breast Surgeons on a subset of DCIS patients treated efficaciously with APBI."

Here we present 5-year results of a prospective trial. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From October 2003 through November 2005, 98 evaluable patients with stage I breast cancer were enrolled in the first dose step (32 Gy delivered in 8 twice-daily fractions) of a prospective, multi-institutional, dose escalation clinical trial of 3-dimensional conformal external beam APBI (3D-APBI). Median age was 61 years; median tumor size was 0.8 cm; 89% of tumors were estrogen receptor positive; 10% had a triple-negative phenotype; and 1% had a HER-2-positive subtype. Median follow-up was 71 months (range, 2-88 months; interquartile range, 64-75 months). RESULTS: Five patients developed ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), for a 5-year actuarial IBTR rate of 5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-10%). Three of these cases occurred in patients with triple-negative disease and 2 in non-triple-negative patients, for 5-year actuarial IBTR rates of 33% (95% CI, 0%-57%) and 2% (95% CI, 0%-6%; P<.0001), respectively. On multivariable analysis, triple-negative phenotype was the only predictor of IBTR, with borderline statistical significance after adjusting for tumor grade (P=.0537). CONCLUSIONS: Overall outcomes were excellent, particularly for patients with estrogen receptor-positive disease. Patients in this study with triple-negative breast cancer had a significantly higher IBTR rate than patients with other receptor phenotypes when treated with 3D-APBI. Larger, prospective 3D-APBI clinical trials should continue to evaluate the effect of hormone receptor phenotype on IBTR rates."

Acute and late toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute's CTC for Adverse Events. Cosmesis was defined based on modified Harvard criteria. Differences between dosimetric or clinical parameters of patients with/without G2 or more late toxicity or unsatisfactory (poor or fair) cosmetic outcome were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were calculated for cosmesis and fibrosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses(UVA/MVA) were used to determine covariates associated with an increase in fibrosis or fat necrosis rate. RESULTS: Sixty four patients were enrolled. With a median follow-up of 3 years, G2 and G3 subcutaneous fibrosis was detected in 20(31%) and in 8(13%) patients, and >/=G2 fat necrosis was observed in 2(3%) patients. Good to excellent, fair and poor cosmesis was observed in 38(59%), 23(36%) and 3(5%) patients, respectively. Based on UVA, the breast volume receiving more than 21 Gy (V21 Gy) was found to be a predictor of the >/=G1 or >/=G2 fibrosis/fat necrosis. Based on MVA, V21 Gy was confirmed as a predictor for >/=G1 fibrosis/fat necrosis, the results correlated as a trend for >/=G2. Cosmesis was correlated with whole breast (WB) mean dose (p=0.030). CONCLUSION: Our choice of a single dose of 21 Gy significantly increased the treatment related toxicity. However, this should not discourage novel SSPBI approaches with lower equivalent doses."

Overall, 16 patients with T1/2N0 breast cancer were treated with 3D-CRT (multiple, noncoplanar photon fields) on the RTOG 0413 partial-breast trial. These cases were subsequently replanned using static gantry IMRT and V-MAT technology to understand dosimetric differences among these 3 techniques. Several dosimetric parameters were used in plan quality evaluation, including dose conformity index (CI) and dose-volume histogram analysis of normal tissue coverage. Quality assurance studies including gamma analysis were performed to compare the measured and calculated dose distributions. The IMRT and V-MAT plans gave more conformal target dose distributions than the 3D-CRT plans (p < 0.05 in CI). The volume of ipsilateral breast receiving 5 and 10Gy was significantly less using the V-MAT technique than with either 3D-CRT or IMRT (p < 0.05). The maximum lung dose and the ipsilateral lung volume receiving 10 (V10) or 20Gy (V20) were significantly less with both V-MAT and IMRT (p < 0.05). The IMRT technique was superior to 3D-CRT and V-MAT of low dose distributions in ipsilateral lung (p < 0.05 in V5 and D5). The total mean monitor units (MUs) for V-MAT (621.0 +/- 111.9) were 12.2% less than those for 3D-CRT (707.3 +/- 130.9) and 46.5% less than those for IMRT (1161.4 +/- 315.6) (p < 0.05). The average machine delivery time was 1.5 +/- 0.2 minutes for the V-MAT plans, 7.0 +/- 1.6 minutes for the 3D-CRT plans, and 11.5 +/- 1.9 minutes for the IMRT plans, demonstrating much less delivery time for V-MAT. Based on this preliminary study, V-MAT and IMRT techniques offer improved dose conformity as compared with 3D-CRT techniques without increasing dose to the ipsilateral lung.

This report updates secondary endpoints of toxicity and efficacy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with stage I or II invasive breast cancer (tumor size </=3 cm, </=3 positive lymph nodes, negative margins) were eligible for 3D-CRT APBI: 38.5 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions. Patient characteristics and treatment details have previously been reported. Adverse events were graded with CTCAE v3.0 (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0). This analysis updates the rates of ipsilateral breast recurrence (IBR), contralateral breast recurrence, ipsilateral node recurrence (INR), metastatic sites (distant metastases [DM]), mastectomy, disease-free survival, mastectomy-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: Of 58 enrolled patients, 52 were eligible, with a median age of 61 years; 94% had stage I cancer and 83% had estrogen receptor positive disease. The median follow-up period was 8 years (minimum-maximum, 1.7-9.0 years). The 7-year estimate of isolated IBR (no DM) was 5.9%. The 7-year estimates of all IBRs, INR, mastectomy rate, and DM were 7.7%, 5.8%, 7.7%, and 7.7%, respectively. All 4 IBRs were invasive, of which 3 had a component within the planning target volume. The patterns of failure were as follows: 3 IBRs, 1 INR, 2 DM, 1 INR plus DM, and 1 IBR plus INR plus DM. The 7-year estimates of mastectomy-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 71.2%, 71.2%, and 78.8%, respectively. Thirteen patients died: 3 of breast cancer and 10 of other causes. Grade 3 (G3) treatment-related adverse events were reported by 4 patients (7.7%). No G3 pain or pulmonary or cardiac toxicities were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This phase 1 and 2 trial of 3D-CRT APBI continues to show durable tumor control and minimal G3 toxicity, comparable to other APBI techniques. Mature phase 3 results will determine the appropriateness and limitations of this noninvasive APBI technique."

Dose-volume relationships may be responsible for this poor cosmesis. We aimed to determine the feasibility of limiting the exposure of nontarget breast tissue to radiation through smaller planning target volumes achieved through daily image guidance and 4-dimensional computed tomography simulation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligibility criteria included the following: women, age >/=50 years, Karnofsky performance status score >/=70, stage 0 and I breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery, margins clear by >/=2 mm, pathologic tumor size </=2 cm, and 4-dimensional computed tomography with planning target volumes of 0.2 cm rather than the standard 1.0 cm. A dose of 3850 cGy was prescribed in 10 fractions. The study was considered successful if >/=50% of enrollees met dosimetric constraints on the breast (V50 < 45% and V100 < 23.5%). RESULTS: The study achieved its primary endpoint of feasibility of reducing the nontarget breast dose with a breast median of V50 = 31% and V100 = 11%. There were no recurrences and no toxicity grade >3. At baseline, fair/poor cosmesis was low (2.2%). By year 3, adverse cosmesis post-APBI had increased by 13.2% (to 15.4%). Patient decisional satisfaction was reached completely in 84.2% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that with 4-dimensional simulated APBI that uses stringent dosimetric constraints and image guidance radiation therapy, it is possible to obtain acceptable cosmetic outcomes. We report no locoregional recurrences in 3 years and no toxicity grade >3. The observed decline in cosmesis was acceptable compared with that of prior published studies, and patient satisfaction with APBI was excellent."

Compared to conventional whole breast irradiation that takes 5 to 6 weeks, APBI is reported to induce worse cosmetic outcomes both when using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). These late normal tissue effects may be attributed to the dose volume effect because a large portion of the non-target breast tissue volume (NTBTV) receives a high dose. In the context of APBI, non-coplanar beams could spare the NTBTV more efficiently. This study evaluates the dosimetric benefit of using the Cyberknife (CK) for APBI in comparison to IMRT (Tomotherapy) and three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). METHODS: The possibility of using surgical clips, implanted during surgery, to track target movements is investigated first. A phantom of a female thorax was designed in-house using the measurements of 20 patients. Surgical clips of different sizes were inserted inside the breast. A treatment plan was delivered to the mobile and immobile phantom. The motion compensation accuracy was evaluated using three radiochromic films inserted inside the breast. Three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), Tomotherapy (TOMO) and CK treatment plans were calculated for 10 consecutive patients who received APBI in Lille. To ensure a fair comparison of the three techniques, margins applied to the CTV were set to 10 mm. However, a second CK plan was prepared using 3 mm margins to evaluate the benefits of motion compensation. RESULTS: Only the larger clips (VITALITEC Medium-Large) could be tracked inside the larger breast (all gamma indices below 1 for 1 % of the maximum dose and 1 mm). All techniques meet the guidelines defined in the NSABP/RTOG and SHARE protocols. As the applied dose volume constraints are very strong, insignificant dosimetric differences exist between techniques regarding the PTV coverage and the sparing of the lung and heart. However, the CK may be used to reduce high doses received by the NTBTV more efficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic stereotactic radiotherapy may be used for APBI to more efficiently spare the NTBTV and improve cosmetic results of APBI."

We therefore examined the risk of pneumonitis in relation to lung dose-volume parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our prospective dose-escalation trial enrolled 198 treated patients from 2003 to 2007. Patients received 32 or 36 Gy in 4-Gy fractions, given twice daily: 29 (14%) were treated with pure photons; 149 (77%) with mixed photons and electrons; and 20 (10%) with protons. RESULTS: There were four cases of pneumonitis at 4, 4, 7, and 9 months after treatment. All were in the 36-Gy cohort and were treated with pure photons. The risk of pneumonitis for the two cohorts combined was: 17% (four of 24) for an ipsilateral lung volume (ILV) receiving 20 Gy or higher (ILV, 20 Gy) of 3% or higher (P = .0002 for comparison to ILV 20 Gy < 3%, Fisher's exact test); 20% (four of 20) for an ILV 10 Gy of 10% or higher (P = .0001); and 15% (four of 26) for an ILV 5 Gy of 20% or higher (P = .0002). CONCLUSION: The risk of pneumonitis appeared related to the ILV treated. This volume can be reduced by using mixed photons and electron when possible. We recommend that the ILV 20 Gy should be lower than 3%, the ILV 10 Gy lower than 10%, and the ILV 5 Gy lower than 20% when purely coplanar techniques are used."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 105 patients with Stage I breast cancer were treated between February 2004 and March 2007 in a Phase II prospective trial and had detailed information available on the planning target volume (PTV), ipsilateral breast volume (IBV), PTV/IBV ratio, lung volume, chest wall volume, surgery to radiotherapy interval, follow-up interval, breast pain, and cosmesis. The first 7 of these patients were treated to 34 Gy, and the remaining 98 were treated to 38.5 Gy. All patients were treated twice daily for 5 consecutive days. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 13 months. No recurrences or deaths were observed. Of the 105 patients, 30 reported mild or moderate breast pain in their most recently recorded follow-up visit. The irradiated lung volume (p < 0.05) and chest wall volume receiving >35 Gy (p < 0.01) were associated with pain. The PTV, but not the PTV/IBV ratio, also correlated with pain (p < 0.01 and p = 0.42, respectively). A total of 72 patients reported excellent, 32 reported good, and 1 reported poor cosmesis. Physician-rated cosmesis reported 90 excellent and 15 good. None of the tested variables correlated with the cosmetic outcomes. CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy to the chest wall (chest wall volume receiving >35 Gy) and to lung correlated with reports of mild pain after accelerated partial breast intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Also, the PTV, but not the PTV/IBV ratio, was predictive of post-treatment reports of pain."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-three patients with Tis-1N0M0 breast cancer were treated on a Phase II prospective accelerated partial-breast IMRT protocol at two facilities between April 2004 and January 2006. Fifty-six patients had data sets sufficient to adequately contour all structures. These cases were subsequently replanned with 3D-CRT techniques using the same contours, to compare the dose distribution patterns of 3D-CRT vs. IMRT. RESULTS: The average planning target volume (PTV) to ipsilateral breast (IB) ratio was 24% (range, 7-58%). The average volume of IB receiving 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the prescribed dose was 4.0%, 5.0%, 5.5%, and 10.5% less with IMRT than with 3D (p < 0.01). The dose reduction to normal breast was further improved in the subset of patients whose PTV to IB ratio was >25%, and in patients with contoured breast volume <750 cm(3). No difference was detected in delivery to the lumpectomy cavity or clinical target volume. The PTV volume receiving 95% of the dose was higher in the 3D conformal plans (p < 0.01), but no significant difference was observed in the PTV volume receiving 90% (p = 0.17). The irradiated heart and lung volumes were small with both techniques but also favored IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: In T1N0 patients treated with external beam partial-breast radiotherapy, IMRT improves normal tissue sparing in the ipsilateral breast compared with 3DRT, without compromising dose delivery to the lumpectomy cavity and clinical target volume."

AIM: To compare the intensity modulated radiotherapy with the 3D tangential beams technique in respect of dose distribution in target volume and critical organs they generate in patients with early-stage breast cancer who received breast-conserving therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dosimetric analysis was performed to assess the three radiotherapy techniques used in each of 10 consecutive patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving therapy. Radiotherapy was planned with the use of all the three techniques: 3D tangential beams with electron boost, IMRT with electron boost, and intensity modulated radiotherapy with simultaneous integrated boost. RESULTS: The use of the IMRT techniques enables more homogenous dose distribution in target volume. The range of mean and median dose to the heart and lung was lower with the IMRT techniques in comparison to the 3D tangential beams technique. The range of mean dose to the heart amounted to 0.3-3.5 Gy for the IMRT techniques and 0.4-4.3 for the tangential beams technique. The median dose to the lung on the irradiated side amounted to 4.9-5 Gy for the IMRT techniques and 5.6 Gy for the 3D tangential beams technique. CONCLUSION: The application of the IMRT techniques in radiotherapy patients with early-stage breast cancer allows to obtain more homogenous dose distribution in target volume, while permitting to reduce the dose to critical organs."

Partial breast irradiation techniques included interstitial brachytherapy, balloon-based brachytherapy, and 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Clinical outcomes including local recurrence, regional recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Mean follow up was 3.0 years, with a mean patient age of 61.8 years. At 5 years, the rates of local recurrence and regional recurrence were 1.4% and 0%, respectively.

Moreover, there are recent reports of increased fibrosis and unacceptable cosmesis with APBI using external beam with BID fractionation. We adopted a once daily regimen of APBI with fractionation similar to that shown to be effective in a Canadian randomized trial of whole breast irradiation. It is unclear whether patients with DCIS or invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) are suitable for APBI. METHODS: The retrospective cohort included 310 patients with 312 tumors of T1-T2N0-N1micM0 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), ILC, or Tis (DCIS) treated with APBI via external beam. Most patients were treated using IMRT with 16 daily fractions of 270 cGy to a dose of 4320 cGy. The target volume included the lumpectomy cavity plus 1.0 cm to account for microscopic disease and an additional 0.5 to 1.0 cm for setup uncertainty and breathing motion. Ipsilateral breast failure (IBF) was pathologically confirmed as a local failure (LF) or an elsewhere failure (EF). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 49 months. Among the 312 cases, 213 were IDC, 31 ILC, and 68 DCIS. Median tumor size was 1.0 cm. There were 9 IBFs (2.9%) including 5 LFs and 4 EFs. The IBF rates among patients with IDC, ILC, and DCIS were 2.4%, 3.2%, and 4.4%, respectively, with no significant difference between histologies. When patients were analyzed by the ASTRO APBI consensus statement risk groups, 32% of treated cases were considered suitable, 50% cautionary, and 18% unsuitable. The IBF rates among suitable, cautionary, and unsuitable patients were 4.0%, 2.6%, and 1.8%, respectively, with no significant difference between risk groups. Acute skin reactions were rare and long-term cosmetic outcome was very good to excellent. CONCLUSIONS: External beam APBI with once daily fractionation has a low rate of IBF consistent with other published APBI studies. The ASTRO risk stratification did not differentiate a subset of patients with a higher rate of IBF. APBI may be an appropriate treatment for women with DCIS and ILC."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred patients treated with 3D-CRT accelerated partial breast irradiation were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 scale. Cosmesis was scored using Harvard criteria. Multiple dosimetric and volumetric parameters were analyzed for their association with worst and last (W/L) toxicity outcomes. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients had a minimum of 36 months of toxicity follow-up (median follow-up, 4.8 years). The W/L incidence of poor-fair cosmesis, any telangiectasia, and grade >/=2 induration, volume reduction, and pain were 16.4%/11.5%, 24.2%/14.5%, 16.1%/9.7%, 17.7%/12.9%, and 11.3%/3.2%, respectively. Only the incidence of any telangiectasia was found to be predicted by any dosimetric parameter, with the absolute breast volume receiving 5% to 50% of the prescription dose (192.5 cGy-1925 cGy) being significant. No associations with maximum dose, volumes of lumpectomy cavity, breast, modified planning target volume, and PTV, dose homogeneity index, number of fields, and photon energy used were identified with any of the aforementioned toxicities. Non-upper outer quadrant location was associated with grade >/=2 volume reduction (p = 0.02 W/p = 0.04 L). A small cavity-to-skin distance was associated with a grade >/=2 induration (p = 0.03 W/p = 0.01 L), a borderline significant association with grade >/=2 volume reduction (p = 0.06 W/p = 0.06 L) and poor-fair cosmesis (p = 0.08 W/p = 0.09 L), with threshold distances ranging from 5 to 8 mm. CONCLUSIONS: No dose--volume relationships associated with long-term toxicity were identified in this large patient cohort with extended follow-up. Cosmetic results were good-to-excellent in 88% of patients at 5 years."

The present study was performed to clarify which patients are unsuitable for APBI to avoid late severe toxicities. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Study subjects comprised 50 consecutive patients with Stage 0-II unilateral breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery, and in whom five or six surgical clips were placed during surgery. All patients were subsequently replanned using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) APBI techniques according to the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-39 and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0413 protocol. The beam arrangements included mainly noncoplanar four- or five-field beams using 6-MV photons alone. RESULTS: Dose-volume histogram (DVH) constraints for normal tissues according to the NSABP/RTOG protocol were satisfied in 39 patients (78%). Multivariate analysis revealed that only long craniocaudal clip distance (CCD) was correlated with nonoptimal DVH constraints (p = 0.02), but that pathological T stage, anteroposterior clip distance (APD), site of ipsilateral breast (IB) (right/left), location of the tumor (medial/lateral), and IB reference volume were not. DVH constraints were satisfied in 20% of patients with a long CCD (>/=5.5 cm) and 92% of those with a short CCD (p < 0.0001). Median IB reference volume receiving >/=50% of the prescribed dose (IB-V(50)) of all patients was 49.0% (range, 31.4-68.6). Multivariate analysis revealed that only a long CCD was correlated with large IB-V(50) (p < 0.0001), but other factors were not. CONCLUSION: Patients with long CCDs (>/=5.5 cm) might be unsuitable for 3D-CRT APBI because of nonoptimal DVH constraints and large IB-V(50)."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 281 patients with pTis, pT1N0, or pT2N0 (</=3.0 cm) breast cancer treated with segmental mastectomy were prospectively enrolled from December 2008 through August 2014. APBI was delivered using 3-dimensional CRT (n = 29) or with SAVI (n = 176), Contura (n = 56), or MammoSite (n = 20) brachytherapy catheters. Patients were evaluated at protocol-specified intervals, at which time the radiation oncologist scored cosmetic outcome, toxicities, and recurrence status using a standardized template. RESULTS: The median follow-up time is 41 months. Grade 1 seroma and fibrosis were more common with brachytherapy than with 3-dimensional CRT (50.4% vs 3.4% for seroma; P < .0001 and 66.3% vs 44.8% for fibrosis; P = .02), but grade 1 edema was more common with 3-dimensional CRT than with brachytherapy (17.2% vs 5.6%; P = .04). Grade 2 to 3 pain was more common with 3-dimensional CRT (17.2% vs 5.2%; P = .03). Actuarial 5-year rates of fair or poor radiation oncologist-reported cosmetic outcome were 9% for 3-dimensional CRT and 24% for brachytherapy (P = .13). Brachytherapy was significantly associated with inferior cosmesis on mixed model analysis (P = .003). Significant predictors of reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy were D0.1cc (skin) </=102%, minimum skin distance >5.1 mm, dose homogeneity index >0.54, and volume of nonconformance </=0.89 cc. The 5-year ipsilateral breast recurrence was 4.3% for brachytherapy and 4.2% for 3-dimensional CRT APBI patients (P = .95). CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy APBI is associated with higher rates of grade 1 fibrosis and seroma than 3-dimensional CRT but lower rates of grade 1 edema and grade 2 to 3 pain than 3-dimensional CRT. Rates of radiation oncologist-reported fair or poor cosmetic outcomes are higher with brachytherapy. We identified dosimetric parameters that predict reduced risk of adverse cosmetic outcome after brachytherapy-based APBI. Ipsilateral breast recurrence was equivalent for brachytherapy and 3-dimensional CRT."

We present our initial experience using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-one patients with tumors of 2 cm or less and negative axillary nodes were treated with 3D-CRT accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) between August 2003 and March 2005. The prescribed radiation dose was 32 Gy in 4-Gy fractions given twice daily. Efforts were made to minimize the number of beams required to achieve adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage. RESULTS: A combination of photons and electrons was used in 85% of patients. A three-field technique that consisted of opposed, conformal tangential photons and enface electrons was employed in 43 patients (70%). Nine patients (15%) were treated with a four-field arrangement, which consisted of three photon fields and enface electrons. Mean PTV volumes that received 100%, 95%, and 90% of the prescribed dose were 93% +/- 7%, 97% +/- 4%, and 98% +/- 2%, respectively. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 7 patients (11%). Mean doses to the ipsilateral lung and heart were 1.8 Gy and 0.8 Gy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Simple 3D-CRT techniques of APBI can achieve appropriate PTV coverage while offering significant normal-tissue sparing. Therefore, this noninvasive approach may increase the availability of APBI to patients with early-stage breast cancer."

We present our initial experience with protons for three-dimensional, conformal, external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (3D-CPBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2004 to June 2005, 25 patients with tumors < or =2 cm and negative axillary nodes were treated with proton 3D-CPBI. The prescribed dose was 32 Cobalt Gray Equivalents (CGE) in 4 CGE fractions given twice daily. One to three fields were used to provide adequate planning target volume (PTV) coverage and dose homogeneity. RESULTS: Excellent PTV coverage and dose homogeneity were obtained in all patients with one to three proton beams. The median PTV receiving 95% of the prescribed dose was 100%. Dose inhomogeneity exceeded 10% in only 1 patient (4%). The median volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose was 23%. Median volumes of ipsilateral lung receiving 20 CGE, 10 CGE, and 5 CGE were 0%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. The contralateral lung and heart received essentially no radiation dose. Cost analysis suggests that proton 3D-CPBI is only modestly more expensive (25%) than traditional whole-breast irradiation (WBI). CONCLUSION: Proton 3D-CPBI is technically feasible, providing both excellent PTV coverage and normal tissue sparing. It markedly reduces the volume of nontarget breast tissue irradiated compared with photon-based 3D-CPBI, addressing a principle disadvantage of external-beam approaches to PBI. As proton therapy becomes more widely available, it may prove an attractive tool for 3D-CPBI."

Patients had to be 60 years old or over and treated with breast conservative surgery for early stage invasive carcinoma. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were analyzed. Median follow-up was 40 months. The proposed schedule was well tolerated. No Grade 3 toxicity was documented. Late toxicity was assessable for all the treated patients. Two patients (2.7%) developed Grade 2 pain 6 months after PBI. Four patients (5%) developed asymptomatic fat necrosis. Grade 2 fibrosis was observed in 5 patients (6.7%). No correlation was found between early and late toxicity and the type of adjuvant systemic therapy (no therapy vs. hormonal therapy vs. chemotherapy). No statistical correlation between dosimetric parameters and toxicity was found. Patients who developed Grade 2 radiation fibrosis had not higher radiation volumes to the untreated normal breast than those without fibrosis. Cosmesis was judged good/excellent in the majority of the cases (93%).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From November 2003 to June 2006, 60 breasts on 59 patients were treated with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) APBI. Patients with stage 0, I, or II breast cancer were eligible if a <3-cm tumor was resected with negative surgical margins, and axillary evaluation documented 0-3 positive nodes. The mean age was 58.7 years (range, 31-88 years). Target volume and critical structure definitions, as well as dose delivery guidelines, were consistent across both institutions. Treatment was twice daily for 5 consecutive days with 3.85 Gy per fraction to 38.5 Gy. Clinical follow-up was conducted at regular intervals that included history, physical exam, and mammography. The overall cosmesis was graded using the Harvard scale and toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (v4.0), including hyperpigmentation, edema, telangiectasia, mastalgia, surgical defect, fibrosis, and fat necrosis. Dose-volume histogram and treatment parameters were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 44.3 months (range, 2-94 months), there were 4 cases of grade 3-4 toxicity (7%): 1 patient with mastalgia; 1 patient with mastalgia and fat necrosis; 1 patient with telangiectasia; and 1 patient with fibrosis. There was no statistical correlate between dosimetric parameters and cosmetic outcome. Overall cosmetic outcome was good or excellent in 58 breasts (95%) and fair to poor"" in 3 (5%). There were no local-regional failures; 3 patients failed distantly (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Accelerated partial breast irradiation using 3D-CRT is safe and the risk of serious chronic side effect is low and acceptable."""

The 3D-CRT was 38.5 Gy in 3.85 Gy/fraction delivered 2x/day. Ipsilateral breast, ipsilateral nodal, contralateral breast, and distant failure (IBF, INF, CBF, DF) were estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Mastectomy-free, disease-free, and overall survival (MFS, DFS, OS) were recorded. The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3, was used to grade acute and late toxicity. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were entered and 52 patients are eligible and evaluable for efficacy. The median age of patients was 61 years with the following characteristics: 46% tumor size <1 cm; 87% invasive ductal histology; 94% American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage I; 65% postmenopausal; 83% no chemotherapy; and 71% with no hormone therapy. Median follow-up is 4.5 years (1.7-4.8).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients referred for postoperative radiation therapy after lumpectomy were treated with PBI using our previously reported 3D-CRT technique. Ninety-four percent of patients had surgical clips outlining the lumpectomy cavity (mean: 6 clips). The clinical target volume (CTV) consisted of the lumpectomy cavity plus a 10-mm margin in 9 patients and 15-mm margin in 22 (median: 15 mm). The planning target volume consisted of the CTV plus a 10-mm margin for breathing motion and treatment setup uncertainties. The prescribed dose (PD) was 34 or 38.5 Gy (6 patients and 25 patients, respectively) in 10 fractions b.i.d. separated by 6 h and delivered in 5 consecutive days. Patients were treated in the supine position with 3-5 beams (mean: 4) designed to irradiate the CTV with <10% inhomogeneity and a comparable or lower dose to the heart, lung, and contralateral breast compared with standard whole-breast tangents. The median follow-up duration is 10 months (range: 1-30 months). Four patients have been followed >2 years, 6 >1.5 years, and 5 >1 year. The remaining 16 patients have been followed <12 months. RESULTS: No skin changes greater than Grade 1 erythema were noted during treatment. At the initial 4-8-week follow-up visit, 19 patients (61%) experienced Grade 1 toxicity and 3 patients (10%) Grade 2 toxicity. No Grade 3 toxicities were observed. The remaining 9 patients (29%) had no observable radiation effects. Cosmetic results were rated as good/excellent in all evaluable patients at 6 months (n = 3), 12 months (n = 5), 18 months (n = 6), and in the 4 evaluable patients at >2 years after treatment. The mean coverage of the CTV by the 100% isodose line (IDL) was 98% (range: 54-100%, median: 100%) and by the 95% IDL, 100% (range: 99-100%). The mean coverage of the planning target volume by the 95% IDL was 100% (range: 97-100%). The mean percentage of the breast receiving 100% of the PD was 23% (range: 14-39%).

METHODS: A retrospective dosimetric comparison of interstitial HDR brachytherapy, MammoSite balloon brachytherapy, and 3D-CRT was performed. Thirty patients including 10 from each treatment technique were included for a dosimetric comparison of the dose received by the ipsilateral breast, PTV, heart, and ipsilateral lung. Interstitial patients were treated with 4 Gy in 8 fractions to 32 Gy, and the MammoSite patients were treated with 3.4 Gy in 10 fractions to 34 Gy. 3D-CRT patients were treated with 3.85 Gy in 10 fractions to 38.5 Gy using multiple isocentric beams. The CT images from simulation or implant evaluation were transferred into our 3D treatment planning software. The lumpectomy cavities were outlined for every patient, except the MammoSite patients, where the cavity was defined by the balloon edge. The PTV was constructed as a uniform expansion of 1.5 cm for all interstitial HDR patients, 1.0 cm for the MammoSite patients, and a 1.0 cm expansion in addition to the CTV expansion of 1.0 cm (n=2), and 1.5 cm (n=8) for the 3D-CRT patients. The CTV expansion for 3D-CRT and the PTV expansion for the brachytherapy patients were limited to the chest wall and skin. Normal structures including both ipsilateral lung and breast and heart for left-sided lesions were outlined. The lumpectomy cavity was subtracted from the PTV and normal breast tissue for evaluation. To evaluate dose to the ipsilateral breast and lung, PTV, and heart, a dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis was performed. All histograms were normalized to the volume of the structure (i.e., expressed as percent volume). RESULTS: The average percentage of the breast receiving 100% and 50% of the prescribed dose (PD) was higher in the 3D-CRT group (24% and 48%, respectively) compared with the MammoSite (5% and 18%, respectively) and interstitial patients (10% and 26%, respectively). Improved coverage of the PTV was noted in the 3D-CRT plans compared with the MammoSite and interstitial HDR plans. With the interstitial HDR technique, 58% of the PTV received 100% of the PD compared with 76% with MammoSite and 100% with 3D-CRT techniques. The percentage of the PTV receiving 90% of the PD was 68%, 91%, and 100% for the interstitial HDR, MammoSite, and 3D-CRT patients, respectively. The ipsilateral lung V20 was slightly higher for 3D-CRT at 5% compared with 0% for both brachytherapy techniques. CONCLUSION: In those treated with 3D-CRT, coverage of the PTV was better with 3D-CRT but varied with the definition used. At the coverage at 90% of the PD, no difference was observed between 3D-CRT and MammoSite (which were both better than interstitial). 3D-CRT resulted in better coverage of the PTV compared with MammoSite or interstitial brachytherapy techniques. Better PTV coverage with 3D-CRT came at the cost of a higher integral dose to the remaining normal breast. Dosimetrically, the best partial breast irradiation technique appears to depend on the clinical situation. Of the brachytherapy techniques, MammoSite appears to be superior in PTV coverage. When comparing MammoSite vs. 3D-CRT PTV coverage at 90% of the PD, the difference was not significantly different."

IMRT results in improved target coverage, reduced dose inhomogeneity within the breast, and reduced dose to the heart, lungs, and contralateral breast. However, this has been at the cost of larger volumes of low-dose radiation to these structures, thus increasing the theoretic risk for second malignancies. Our goal was to develop an IMRT beam arrangement that did not result in additional low-dose spill to organs at risk while maintaining equal or better target coverage. Five patients with early-stage left-sided breast cancer, who underwent breast conservation surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy, were chosen for this comparative study. The conventional radiation treatment (CRT) plan was comprised of standard wedged tangential fields. An IMRT plan consisting of 6 tangential beams (3 medial and 3 lateral) was generated by using the gantry, collimator, and table angles of the standard plan used for the CRT plan, and moving the table +10 degrees and -10 degrees on each side. The prescription dose for both CRT and IMRT plans was 45 Gy, 1.8 Gy/fraction, prescribed to the isocenter, which was placed near the center of the breast. IMRT plans provided significantly better coverage of the left breast than the CRT plans (p = 0.03). Although the dose heterogeneity was greater with the IMRT plans, the difference was not significant (p = 0.68). The mean volumes of the heart, lung, and right breast were lower in patients planned with IMRT at all dose levels from 5% to 100% dose (5% increments). This difference was significant for volumes receiving 2.25 Gy for the heart (p = 0.003), and volumes receiving 2.25, 4.5, 6.75, 33.75, 36, 38.25, and 42.75 Gy for the lung (p = 0.014, 0.04, 0.044, 0.05, 0.049, 0.045, and 0.05, respectively). Surprisingly, breast IMRT resulted in significantly lower right breast volumes irradiated at all dose levels compared to CRT. A 6-tangential-field IMRT technique achieved significantly better left breast coverage while maintaining lower doses to risk organs at all dose levels and therefore reduced the potential for induction of a second malignancy."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligibility criteria included in-breast recurrence occurring >1 year after whole-breast irradiation, <3 cm, unifocal, and resected with negative margins. Partial-breast reirradiation was targeted to the surgical cavity plus 1.5 cm; a prescription dose of 45 Gy in 1.5 Gy twice daily for 30 treatments was used. The primary objective was to evaluate the rate of grade >/=3 treatment-related skin, fibrosis, and/or breast pain adverse events (AEs), occurring </=1 year from re-treatment completion. A rate of >/=13% for these AEs in a cohort of 55 patients was determined to be unacceptable (86% power, 1-sided alpha = 0.07). RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2013, 65 patients were accrued, and the first 55 eligible and with 1 year follow-up were analyzed. Median age was 68 years. Twenty-two patients had ductal carcinoma in situ, and 33 had invasive disease: 19 </=1 cm, 13 >1 to </=2 cm, and 1 >2 cm. All patients were clinically node negative. Systemic therapy was delivered in 51%. All treatment plans underwent quality review for contouring accuracy and dosimetric compliance. All treatment plans scored acceptable for tumor volume contouring and tumor volume dose-volume analysis. Only 4 (7%) scored unacceptable for organs at risk contouring and organs at risk dose-volume analysis. Treatment-related skin, fibrosis, and/or breast pain AEs were recorded as grade 1 in 64% and grade 2 in 7%, with only 1 (<2%) grade >/=3 and identified as grade 3 fibrosis of deep connective tissue. CONCLUSION: Partial-breast reirradiation with 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy after second lumpectomy for patients experiencing in-breast failures after whole-breast irradiation is safe and feasible, with acceptable treatment quality achieved. Skin, fibrosis, and breast pain toxicity was acceptable, and grade 3 toxicity was rare."

At the same time, different beams of IMRT plans were compared to each other in respect to CI, HI and organs at risk (OAR) dose. BACKGROUND: Conventional early breast cancer treatment consists of lumpectomy followed by whole breast radiation therapy. CTT is a traditional method used for whole breast radiotherapy and includes standard wedged tangents (two opposed wedged tangential photon beams). The IMRT technique has been widely used for many treatment sites, allowing both improved sparing of normal tissues and more conformal dose distributions. IMRT is a new technique for whole breast radiotherapy. IMRT is used to improve conformity and homogeneity and used to reduce OAR doses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with left-sided breast carcinoma were treated between 2005 and 2008 using 6, 18 or mixed 6/18 MV photons for primary breast irradiation following breast conserving surgery (BCS). The clinical target volume [CTV] was contoured as a target volume and the contralateral breast, ipsilateral lung, contralateral lung and heart tissues as organs at risk (OAR). IMRT with seven beams (IMRT7), nine beams (IMRT9) and 11 beams (IMRT11) plans were developed and compared with CTT and among each other. The conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), and doses to OAR were compared to each other. RESULTS: ALL OF IMRT PLANS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED CI (CTT: 0.76; IMRT7: 0.84; IMRT9: 0.84; IMRT11: 0.85), HI (CTT: 1.16; IMRT7: 1.12; IMRT9: 1.11; IMRT11: 1.11), volume of the ipsilateral lung receiving more than 20 Gy (>V20 Gy) (CTT: 14.6; IMRT7: 9.08; IMRT9: 8.10; IMRT11: 8.60), and volume of the heart receiving more than 30 Gy (>V30 Gy) (CTT: 6.7; IMRT7: 4.04; IMRT9: 2.80; IMRT11: 2.98) compared to CTT. All IMRT plans were found to significantly decrease >V20 Gy and >V30 Gy volumes compared to conformal plans. But IMRT plans increased the volume of OAR receiving low dose radiotherapy: volume of contralateral lung receiving 5 and 10 Gy (CTT: 0.0-0.0; IMRT7: 19.0-0.7; IMRT9: 17.2-0.66; IMRT11: 18.7-0.58, respectively) and volume of contralateral breast receiving 10 Gy (CTT: 0.03; IMRT7: 0.38; IMRT9: 0.60; IMRT11: 0.68). The differences among IMRT plans with increased number of beams were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: IMRT significantly improved conformity and homogeneity index for plans. Heart and lung volumes receiving high doses were decreased, but OAR receiving low doses was increased."

Wu, J.",2018,The incidence of postoperative radiotherapy-induced acute dermatitis in breast cancer and its influencing factors for Chinese women,breast neoplasm intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) radiotherapy skin acute reaction,1,367,eng,"Purpose: To investigate the incidence of skin acute reaction and its influencing factors in postoperative breast cancer radiotherapy patients. Methods: One hundred and seventy three cases of breast cancer patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy were consecutively enrolled from June 1, 2016 to July 31, 2017 in our breast cancer center. Irradiation technology includes conformal intensity-modulated radiotherapy and a conventional two-dimensional one with conventional fraction. Any acute radiation dermatitis was recorded and the influencing factors were analyzed at the end of the radiation treatment. Results: Radiotherapy-induced acute dermatitis in patients with breast-conserving surgery was relatively mild. Among the 173 patients, 33 cases had no obvious changes in the skin (grade 0); 121 cases had grade 1 skin reactions, manifested as local dark erythema and dry peeling; 29 cases had grade 2 skin reactions, characterized by edema, hyperemia, or erosion part; no grade 3 cases of skin reactions were observed. The incidence of grade 0, grade 1, and grade 2 reactions in all patients was 19.1%, 69.9%, and 11.0%, respectively. The severity of skin acute reaction is independent of the tumor sites, molecular subtypes, patients' age, and irradiation modalities, but it depends on the surgical types, fields treated, and planned total radiation. There is a trend favoring no chemotherapy over chemotherapy, though p-value is 0.074. Conclusion: Skin acute reaction in postoperative radiotherapy breast cancer patients is generally common but mild, and there are quite a few patients who need interruption or cessation of the radiotherapy process. The patients need to be well informed and made aware that any skin reaction will likely be mild, especially for the breast-conserving patients."

Forward and inverse planned IMRT and tomotherapy were investigated as solutions. A standard electron field was compared with a photon field arrangement encompassing the tumor bed boost volume. The out-of-field doses were measured for all methods. RESULTS: Dose-volume constraints of volume >90% receiving 32.4 Gy and volume >95% receiving 50.4 Gy for the whole breast and tumor bed were achieved. The constraint of volume >90% receiving 36 Gy for the partial breast was fulfilled in the inverse IMRT and tomotherapy plans and in 7 of 9 cases of a forward planned IMRT distribution. An electron boost to the tumor bed was inadequate in 8 of 9 cases. The IMRT methods delivered a greater whole body dose than the standard breast tangents. A contralateral lung volume >2.5 Gy was increased in the inverse IMRT and tomotherapy plans, although it did not exceed the constraint. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a set of widely applicable solutions that fulfilled the stringent clinical trial requirements for the delivery of a concomitant three-level dose distribution to the breast."

METHOD: Doses from breast radiotherapy and kilovoltage cone beam CT (CBCT) exposures were obtained from thermoluminescent dosimeter measurements in an anthropomorphic phantom in which the positions of radiosensitive organs were delineated. Five treatment deliveries were investigated: (i) conventional tangential field whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT), (ii) noncoplanar conformal delivery applicable to accelerated partial beast irradiation (APBI), (iii) two-volume simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) treatment, (iv) forward planned three-volume SIB, and (v) inverse-planned three volume SIB. Conformal and intensity modulated radiotherapy methods were used to plan the complex treatments. Techniques spanned the range from simple methods appropriate for patient cohorts with a low cancer recurrence risk to complex plans relevant to cohorts with high recurrence risk. Delineated organs at risk included brain, salivary glands, thyroid, contralateral breast, left and right lung, esophagus, stomach, liver, colon, and bladder. Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) VII cancer incidence models were applied to the measured mean organ doses to determine lifetime attributable risk (LAR) for ages at exposure from 35 to 80 yr according to radiotherapy techniques, and included dose from the CBCT imaging. RESULTS: All LAR decreased with age at exposure and were lowest for brain, thyroid, liver, and bladder (<0.1%). There was little dependence of LAR on radiotherapy technique for these organs and for colon and stomach. LAR values for the lungs for the three SIB techniques were two to three times those from WBRT and APBI. Uncertainties in the LAR models outweigh any differences in lung LAR between the SIB methods. Constraints in the planning of the SIB methods ensured that contralateral breast doses and LAR were comparable to WBRT, despite their added complexity. The smaller irradiated volume of the ABPI plan contributed to a halving of LAR for contralateral breast compared with the other plan types. Daily image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) for a left breast protocol using kilovoltage CBCT contributed <10% to LAR for the majority of organs, and did not exceed 22% of total organ dose. CONCLUSIONS: Phantom measurements and calculations of LAR from the BEIR VII models predict that complex breast radiotherapy techniques do not increase the theoretical risk of second cancer incidence for organs distant from the treated breast, or the contralateral breast where appropriate plan constraints are applied. Complex SIB treatments are predicted to increase the risk of second cancer incidence in the lungs compared to standard whole breast radiotherapy; this is outweighed by the threefold reduction in 5 yr local recurrence risk for patients of high risk of recurrence, and young age, from the use of radiotherapy. APBI may have a favorable impact on risk of second cancer in the contralateral breast and lung for older patients at low risk of recurrence. Intensive use of IGRT increased the estimated values of LAR but these are dominated by the effect of the dose from the radiotherapy, and any increase in LAR from IGRT is much lower than the models' uncertainties."

Our hypothesis is that measures to decrease dose inhomogeneity within the breast and skin with IMRT will improve acute skin toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consists of 73 women with early stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery and IMRT. The IMRT technique involves an iteration method for optimization to generate the IMRT plan, Monte Carlo dose calculation, and a step-and-shoot technique using multileaf collimation for beam delivery. Other aspects of the technique including the clinical definition of the clinical target volume by the physician, patient positioning, tangential beam orientation, dose and field sizes were unchanged compared conventional tangential radiation. These patients were matched one-to-one to a control group of 60 women treated with conventional photon radiation by using their bra size and chest wall separation. The study end point was acute skin toxicity. RESULTS: There were no observed differences in the acute toxicity based upon common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTC) for acute radiation dermatitis. There was no desquamation in 42% of IMRT patients, dry desquamation in 37% and moist desquamation in 21%. The degree of desquamation was greater for conventional patients compared with IMRT patients -52% grade 0, 10% grade 1, and 38% grade 2 (P = 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed desquamation was significantly lower with IMRT for small (P = 0.038) and large breast sizes (P = 0.037), but not medium sizes (P = 0.454). For large breast sizes, the incidence of moist desquamation grade 2 was 48% with IMRT compared with 79% in controls. Significant predictors of moist desquamation on stepwise logistic regression were use of IMRT (P = 0.0011) and breast size (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: IMRT is associated with a decrease in severity of acute desquamation compared with a matched control group treated with conventional radiation therapy. As with conventional radiation, breast size remains the most important prognostic factor for acute skin toxicity. The CTC grading system for acute radiation dermatitis is not sensitive when applied to modern breast cancer treatment because of its dependence of subjective rating of erythema and inability to gauge variations in desquamation. Further study of patient symptoms, quality of life, and cosmesis is needed to evaluate the benefit of IMRT for breast cancer."

However, very recently, ASTRO placed low-risk DCIS patients in the ""suitable"" category. Given this recent change, we aimed to use the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to evaluate past patterns of implantable APBI (IAPBI) utilization in women with DCIS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for patients from 2000 to 2012 with DCIS that underwent lumpectomy and adjuvant radiation therapy. Patients receiving IAPBI were differentiated from those receiving whole breast radiation therapy. Trends based on treatment year and patient demographics were collected, and multivariable logistic regression determined factors independently predictive of use of IAPBI. RESULTS: Of 52,012 eligible patients, 49,450 (95%) underwent external beam radiation and 2562 (5%) received APBI. Though IAPBI utilization steadily increased from 2000 (0.2% of the study population) to 2008 (9.4%), it abruptly declined in 2009 (7.9%, p = 0.009) and yearly thereafter. The 40-49 age group was proportionally most associated with this decline (8.6% in 2008 to 4.3% in 2009). Factors independently associated with IAPBI receipt included increasing age, hormone receptor negative status, and women living in the South. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of IAPBI administration in DCIS are described. These trends are important to consider as a benchmark going forward, in light of the very recent change in ASTRO recommendations to include low-risk DCIS patients."""

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A dosimetric modeling study that compared WBRT and 3D-CRT APBI was performed on CT planning data from 8 patients with left-sided breast cancer. Highly unfavorable cardiac anatomy was defined by the measured contact of the myocardium with the anterior chest wall in the axial and para-sagittal planes. Treatment plans of WBRT and 3D-CRT APBI were generated for each patient in accordance with NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 protocol. Dose-volume relationships of the heart, including the V5min (minimum dose delivered to 5% of the cardiac volume), biological effective dose (BED) of the V5min, and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Despite expected anatomic variation, significantly large differences were found favoring 3D-CRT APBI in cumulative dose-volume histograms (p < 0.01), dose to the entire heart (mean difference 3.85 Gy, p < 0.01), NTCP (median difference, 1.00 Gy; p < 0.01), V5min (mean difference, 24.53 Gy; p < 0.01), and proportional reduction in radiobiological effect on the V5min (85%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Use of 3D-CRT APBI can demonstrate improved sparing of the heart in select patients with highly unfavorable cardiac anatomy for WBRT, and may result in reduced risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality."

This study evaluates the excess risk of secondary cancer for various breast radiotherapy techniques including accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). METHODS: Secondary cancers Lifetime Attributable Risks (LAR) were calculated using a modified BEIR-VII formalism to account for the specific survival of breast cancer patients. Those survivals were extracted from the SEER database. Doses scattered to various organs were measured into a Rando phantom with custom-made breast phantoms. Treatments delivered typical doses of brachytherapy APBI (34Gy in 10 fractions), external beam APBI (38.5Gy in 10 fractions) using 3D-conformal, Cyberknife stereotactic (CK), or VMAT, as well as whole breast irradiation (WBI) delivering 42.5Gy in 16 fractions. RESULTS: WBI resulted in the highest total LAR, with 4.3% excess risk of secondary cancer for a patient treated at age 50years. Lung cancers accounted for 75-97% of secondary malignancies. For a typical early stage patient irradiated at 50, the excess risks of secondary lung cancer were 1.1% for multicatheter HDR, between 2.2% and 2.5% for 3D-CRT or CK, 3.5% for VMAT APBI, and 3.8% for WBI. CONCLUSIONS: APBI reduces the risk of secondary cancer 2-4 fold compared to WBI. These techniques are well suited for long-living early stage breast cancer patients. HDR brachytherapy and 3D-conformal APBI achieve mean lung doses between 1 and 1.5Gy, which could serve as reference."

Subcutaneous fibrosis of the treated breast is an important late effect in whole-breast irradiation. The aim of this study was to compare the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for radiation-induced fibrosis in treated breast using accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) vs conventional treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten postoperative early-stage breast cancer patients (T1N0M0) were included in this dosimetric analysis. APBI treatment was planned using conformal radiotherapy technique and conventional treatment plans included two tangential portals. All the APBI treatment plans were made with five non-coplanar beams with 6 MV photons. The prescription dose was 38 Gy in 10 fractions for the APBI treatments and 50 Gy in 25 fractions, followed by a boost dose of 16 Gy in 8 fractions, for the conventional treatments. We used Lyman's relative-seriality model and the breast fibrosis NTCP model fitting parameters for the study. RESULTS: The equivalent uniform dose (EUD) was 30.09 Gy and 50.79 Gy in APBI and conventional treatment, respectively. The mean NTCP values for ipsilateral breast fibrosis in APBI and conventional treatment were 0.51 and 25.66%, respectively. Using the paired t-test, a statistically significant difference was seen in the breast fibrosis NTCP values for APBI vs conventional treatment (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: APBI reduces the ipsilateral breast fibrosis compared to conventional whole-breast treatment in early-stage breast cancer."

Twenty-four consecutive patients were treated with either PBI (12 patients) or WBI (12 patients). In the PBI arm, the lumpectomy cavity was treated to a total dose of 38.5 Gy at 3.85 Gy per fraction twice daily using a four-field noncoplanar beam setup. A minimum 6 h interval was required between fractions. In the WBI arm, the whole breast including the entirety of the lumpectomy cavity was treated to a total dose of 50.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction daily using opposed tangential beams. The lumpectomy cavity volume, planning target volume for evaluation (PTV_EVAL), and critical structure volumes were contoured for both the PBI and WBI patients. Dosimetric parameters, dose volume histograms (DVHs), and generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) for target and critical structures were compared. Dosimetric results show the PBI plans, compared to the WBI plans, have smaller hot spots in the PTV_EVAL (maximum dose: 104.2% versus 110.9%) and reduced dose to the ipsilateral breast (V50: 48.6% versus 92.1% and V100: 10.2% versus 50.5%), contralateral breast (V3: 0.16% versus 2.04%), ipsilateral lung (V30: 5.8% versus 12.7%), and thyroid (maximum dose: 0.5% versus 2.0%) with p values < or = 0.01. However, similar dose coverage of the PTV_EVAL (98% for PBI and 99% for WBI, on average) was observed and the dose difference for other critical structures was clinically insignificant in both arms. The gEUD data analysis showed the reduction of dose to the ipsilateral breast and lung, contralateral breast and thyroid. In addition, preliminary dermatologic adverse event assessment data suggested reduced skin toxicity for patients treated with the PBI technique."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects enrolled in a study of partial-breast irradiation therapy after segmental mastectomy (intraoperative radiation therapy) plus a random sample of patients who underwent segmental mastectomies followed by conventional whole-breast radiation therapy were identified through the institution's breast cancer database from March 2003 through February 2006. A radiologist specializing in breast imaging reviewed and recorded each patient's pretreatment mammogram for breast density and tumor location and the first post-treatment mammogram, obtained within the first year of treatment, for three common types of mammographic change seen after breast surgery and radiation treatment (breast edema, skin thickening, and surgical scarring), which when severe make it difficult to use mammography for continuing follow-up of the conserved breast. The extent of mammographic change was noted by the radiologist as minimal, moderate, or marked. The data were entered into a database, and statistical analysis was conducted using logistic regression models and chi(2) tests. The effect of breast density on mammographic change was also assessed. RESULTS: The severity of edema was lower with decreasing breast density (P < .006). There was no apparent effect of breast density on the severity of skin thickening. The extent of surgical scarring decreased as breast density increased (P < .026). Analysis of the data from the cumulative logistic regression models demonstrated that even after controlling for breast density, patients who underwent whole-breast radiation therapy had significantly more edema (P = .003), skin thickening (P = .003), and surgical scarring than those who underwent intraoperative radiation therapy (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients have a higher probability of having fewer post-treatment mammographic changes after partial-breast irradiation followed by segmental mastectomy than after breast conservation surgery followed by whole-breast irradiation."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: After approval by our institutional review board, a treatment planning study was performed of 10 patients with left-sided Stage 0-I breast cancer enrolled in a Phase I-II study of APBI using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). After lumpectomy, patients underwent planning computed tomography scans during FB and using an active breathing control device at DIBH. For the FB geometry, standard WBRT and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) APBI plans were created. For the DIBH geometry with active breathing control, WBRT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT APBI plans were created. RESULTS: All APBI techniques had excellent planning target volume coverage. The maximal planning target volume dose was reduced from 116% of the prescription dose to 108% with the IMRT(DIBH) APBI plan. The maximal heart dose was >30 Gy for the WBRT techniques, 8.2 Gy for 3D-CRT(FB), and <5.0 Gy for 3D-CRT(DIBH) and IMRT(DIBH) techniques. The mean left anterior descending artery dose was significantly reduced from 11.4 Gy with WBRT(FB) to 4.2 with WBRT(DIBH) and <2.0 Gy with all APBI techniques. CONCLUSION: Although planning target volume coverage was acceptable with all techniques, the plans using the DIBH geometry resulted in a marked reduction in the normal tissue dose compared with WBRT planned in the absence of cardiac blocking. Additional study is needed to determine whether these techniques result in clinical benefits."

We report updated results of our single institution study using an external beam APBI regimen with a median follow-up of 8 years. METHODS: A total of 290 APBI patients with AJCC Stage 0-II breast cancer were compared with 290 WBI patients with matched tumor characteristics. Toxicities were scored based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0). Cox regression models were used to predict likelihood of freedom from ipsilateral failure. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 8 years in the APBI group and 7.5 years in the WBI group. In the APBI group, there were 18 (6.2%) ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR), 13 (72%) had elsewhere failures (EF), and 5 (28%) had local failures (LF) with a median time to failure of 64.1 months. In the WBI group, there were three (1.0%) IBTR; one (33%) was an EF and two (67%) were LF with a median time to failure of 91 months. APBI was 4.6 times more likely (hazard ratio 4.57, 95% confidence interval 1.3-16.2, p = 0.02) to have an IBTR than WBI after adjusting for age, tumor size, histology, grade, and estrogen receptor status. Fatigue, erythema, and desquamation toxicities were significantly less in the APBI group then the WBI group. CONCLUSIONS: IBTR rates were higher in external beam APBI group compared with WBI, but APBI had fewer toxicities. Clinicians must weigh the risks and benefits of APBI when making a recommendation for partial breast irradiation after lumpectomy."

Breast cancer patients are a potential group to benefit from better guidance in the MRL. However, due to the electron return effect, the skin dose can be increased in presence of a magnetic field. Since large skin areas are generally involved in breast RT, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on the skin dose, for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In ten patients with early-stage breast cancer, targets and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated on postoperative CT scans co-registered with MRI. The OARs included the skin, comprising the first 5 mm of ipsilateral-breast tissue, plus extensions. Three intensity-modulated RT techniques were considered (2x WBI, 1x APBI). Individual beam geometries were used for all patients. Specially developed MRL treatment-planning software was used. Acceptable plans were generated for 0 T, 0.35 T and 1.5 T, using a class solution. The skin dose was augmented in WBI in the presence of a magnetic field, which is a potential drawback, whereas in APBI the induced effects were negligible. This opens possibilities for developing MR-guided partial-breast treatments in the MRL."

METHODS: A total of 29 patients with early-stage breast cancer after lumpectomy were included in this study. APBI-IMRT and WBI-FIF-IMRT plans were generated for each patient. The dosimetric parameters of ipsilateral lung and heart in both plans were then compared with and without radiobiological correction. RESULTS: With and without radiobiological correction, the volume of ipsilateral lung showed a substantially lower radiation exposure in APBI-IMRT with moderate to high doses (P < 0.05) but non-significant increases in volume of ipsilateral lung in 2.5 Gy than WBI-FIF-IMRT (P > 0.905).There was no significant difference in volume of ipsilateral lung receiving 1, 2.5, and 5 Gy between APBI-IMRT and WBI (P > 0.05) in patients with medial tumor location, although APBI-IMRT exposed more lung to 2.5 and 5 Gy. APBI-IMRT significantly decreases the volume of heart receiving low to high doses in left-sided breast cancer (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: APBI-IMRT can significantly spare the volume of heart and ipsilateral lung receiving moderate and high dose. Non-significant increases in volume of the ipsilateral lung exposed to low doses of radiation were observed for APBI-IMRT in comparison to WBI-FIF-IMRT, particularly in patients with medial tumor location. With the increasing interest in APBI-IMRT, our data may help clinicians individualize patient treatment decisions."

Recent encouraging data from phase 3 trials reopened new perspectives for this radiation approach. The aim of the present study was to analyze the long-term efficacy and safety results of the series of patients with DCIS enrolled in the APBI arm of the APBI-IMRT-Florence phase 3 trial (NCT02104895). METHODS: Patients were treated in a phase 3 randomized trial comparing whole breast irradiation (50 Gy in 25 fractions to the whole breast, plus 10 Gy in 5 fractions to the tumor bed) to APBI (30 Gy in 5 nonconsecutive fractions) using the intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique. RESULTS: Overall, 22 patients were treated in the APBI arm. Median age was 62 years (mean 59; range 42-75 years). At a median follow-up of 9.2 years (mean 8.8; range 3.8-12.1 years), no contralateral invasive/DCIS occurrence, distant metastasis, or breast cancer-related death were recorded. The 5- and 10-year local recurrence, distant metastasis-free survival, and breast cancer-specific survival were 100%. The 10-year overall survival rate was 90.9%. No late toxicity at 5 and 10 years was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Waiting for pending studies and mature follow-up, we confirmed the efficacy and safety of APBI for low-risk DCIS."

We hypothesise that partial-breast radiotherapy restricted to the vicinity of the original tumour in women at lower than average risk of local relapse will improve the balance of beneficial versus adverse effects compared with whole-breast radiotherapy. METHODS: IMPORT LOW is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done in 30 radiotherapy centres in the UK. Women aged 50 years or older who had undergone breast-conserving surgery for unifocal invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of grade 1-3, with a tumour size of 3 cm or less (pT1-2), none to three positive axillary nodes (pN0-1), and minimum microscopic margins of non-cancerous tissue of 2 mm or more, were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 40 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy (control), 36 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy and 40 Gy to the partial breast (reduced-dose group), or 40 Gy to the partial breast only (partial-breast group) in 15 daily treatment fractions. Computer-generated random permuted blocks (mixed sizes of six and nine) were used to assign patients to groups, stratifying patients by radiotherapy treatment centre. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment allocation. Field-in-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy was delivered using standard tangential beams that were simply reduced in length for the partial-breast group. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral local relapse (80% power to exclude a 2.5% increase [non-inferiority margin] at 5 years for each experimental group; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the local relapse hazard ratio [HR] was less than 2.03), analysed by intention to treat. Safety analyses were done in all patients for whom data was available (ie, a modified intention-to-treat population). This study is registered in the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN12852634. FINDINGS: Between May 3, 2007, and Oct 5, 2010, 2018 women were recruited. Two women withdrew consent for use of their data in the analysis. 674 patients were analysed in the whole-breast radiotherapy (control) group, 673 in the reduced-dose group, and 669 in the partial-breast group. Median follow-up was 72.2 months (IQR 61.7-83.2), and 5-year estimates of local relapse cumulative incidence were 1.1% (95% CI 0.5-2.3) of patients in the control group, 0.2% (0.02-1.2) in the reduced-dose group, and 0.5% (0.2-1.4) in the partial-breast group. Estimated 5-year absolute differences in local relapse compared with the control group were -0.73% (-0.99 to 0.22) for the reduced-dose and -0.38% (-0.84 to 0.90) for the partial-breast groups. Non-inferiority can be claimed for both reduced-dose and partial-breast radiotherapy, and was confirmed by the test against the critical HR being more than 2.03 (p=0.003 for the reduced-dose group and p=0.016 for the partial-breast group, compared with the whole-breast radiotherapy group). Photographic, patient, and clinical assessments recorded similar adverse effects after reduced-dose or partial-breast radiotherapy, including two patient domains achieving statistically significantly lower adverse effects (change in breast appearance [p=0.007 for partial-breast] and breast harder or firmer [p=0.002 for reduced-dose and p<0.0001 for partial-breast]) compared with whole-breast radiotherapy. INTERPRETATION: We showed non-inferiority of partial-breast and reduced-dose radiotherapy compared with the standard whole-breast radiotherapy in terms of local relapse in a cohort of patients with early breast cancer, and equivalent or fewer late normal-tissue adverse effects were seen. This simple radiotherapy technique is implementable in radiotherapy centres worldwide. FUNDING: Cancer Research UK."

For 14 patients with left breast tumors randomized on the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-39 protocol, computer-generated radiotherapy treatment plans were devised for WBI and PBI. Tumor bed location was designated according to whether more than 50% of the excision cavity was medial or lateral to the nipple line. The volume of heart receiving doses of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 Gy was calculated for all PBI and WBI plans. Dose to 5% of the heart volume (D5) and mean heart dose were also calculated. The biologically-equivalent dose (BED) was calculated to account for the different fractionation used in PBI and WBI. Of the 14 patients, 8 had lateral tumor beds, and 6 had medial tumor beds. The volumes of heart receiving 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 Gy were significantly lower for lateral PBI compared with WBI. For medial PBI, significant cardiac sparing was only seen at a dose of 20 Gy. The difference of D5 values was significant for lateral PBI compared with WBI (p=0.008), but not for medial PBI compared with WBI (p=0.84). The mean dose was also significantly lower for lateral PBI compared with WBI (p=0.008), but not for medial PBI (p=0.16). The results from BED calculations did not change this outcome. Both 3D conformal PBI and standard WBI can deliver relatively low doses to the heart. For patients with lateralized tumor beds, PBI offers significant cardiac sparing compared with WBI. Patients with medial lesions have relatively similar heart dosimetry with PBI and WBI. 3D conformal PBI is an emerging treatment modality and continued participation on clinical trials is encouraged. Patients with left-sided lesions and lateralized tumor beds warrant special consideration for PBI, given the significant cardiac dose sparing."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Radiotherapy treatment plans were devised for WBI and 3D-PBI for 25 consecutive patients randomized on the NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 protocol at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. WBI plans were for 50 Gy in 25 fractions, and 3D-PBI plans were for 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions. Volume of ipsilateral lung receiving 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 Gy was recorded for each plan. The linear quadratic equation was used to calculate the corresponding dose delivered in 10 fractions and volume of ipsilateral lung receiving these doses was recorded for PBI plans. Ipsilateral mean lung dose was recorded for each plan and converted to BED. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in volume of lung receiving 20 Gy with PBI (median, 4.4% vs. 7.5%; p < 0.001), which remained after correction for fractionation (median, 5.6% vs. 7.5%; p = 0.02). Mean lung dose was lower for PBI (median, 3.46 Gy vs. 4.57 Gy; p = 0.005), although this difference lost significance after conversion to BED (median, 3.86 Gy(3) vs 4.85 Gy(3), p = 0.07). PBI plans exposed more lung to 2.5 and 5 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: 3D-PBI exposes greater volumes of lung tissue to low doses of radiation and spares the amount of lung receiving higher doses when compared with WBI."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From September 2005, a randomized Phase III clinical trial has been conducted to compare conventional (tangential field) fractionated whole breast treatment (Arm A) with accelerated partial breast irradiation plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (Arm B). For intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the clinical target volume was drawn with a uniform 1-cm margin around the surgical clips in three dimensions. The ipsilateral and contralateral breast, ipsilateral and contralateral lung, heart, and spinal cord were contoured as organs at risk. All the regions of interest were contoured according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements reports 50 and 62 recommendations. RESULTS: In September 2008, 259 patients were randomized and treated. The mean clinical target volume in Arm B was 44 cm(3) and the mean planning target volume was 123 cm(3). The mean value of the ratio between the planning target volume and the ipsilateral breast volume was 21%. The rate of Grade 1 and Grade 2 acute skin toxicity was 22% and 19% in Arm A (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale), respectively. The tolerance in Arm B was excellent with only 5% Grade 1 and 0.8% Grade 2 acute skin toxicity. The planning constraints were fully satisfied in most patients. In a very few cases, this was not possible because of very unfavorable anatomy. Quality assurance procedures were performed according to our internal quality assurance protocol, with excellent results. CONCLUSION: In the present preliminary analysis, we have demonstrated that accelerated partial breast irradiation is feasible, with very low acute toxicity."

Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has the theoretical advantage of a further increase in dose conformity compared with three-dimensional techniques, with more normal tissue sparing. The aim of this randomised trial is to compare the local recurrence and survival of APBI using the IMRT technique after breast-conserving surgery to conventional whole-breast irradiation (WBI) in early stage BC. METHODS: This study was performed at the University of Florence (Florence, Italy). Women aged more than 40years affected by early BC, with a maximum pathological tumour size of 25mm, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either WBI or APBI using IMRT. Patients in the APBI arm received a total dose of 30 Gy to the tumour bed in five daily fractions. The WBI arm received 50Gy in 25 fractions, followed by a boost on the tumour bed of 10Gy in five fractions. The primary end-point was occurrence of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrences (IBTRs); the main analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02104895. FINDINGS: A total of 520 patients were randomised (260 to external WBI and 260 to APBI with IMRT) between March 2005 and June 2013. At a median follow-up of 5.0 years (Interquartile Range (IQR) 3.4-7.0), the IBTR rate was 1.5% (three cases) in the APBI group (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-3.0) and in the WBI group (three cases; 95% CI 0.0-2.8). No significant difference emerged between the two groups (log rank test p=0.86). We identified seven deaths in the WBI group and only one in the APBI group (p=0.057). The 5-year overall survival was 96.6% for the WBI group and 99.4% for the APBI group. The APBI group presented significantly better results considering acute (p=0.0001), late (p=0.004), and cosmetic outcome (p=0.045).

We recently published the 5-year results of the APBI-IMRT-Florence phase 3 randomised trial (NCT02104895), showing a very low rate of disease failure, with acute and early-late toxicity in favour of APBI. We present the early and 2-year follow-up health-related quality of life (HRQoL) results. METHODS: Eligible patients were women aged more than 40 years with early BC suitable for breast-conserving surgery. APBI consisted of 30 Gy in five fractions delivered with IMRT technique. Standard whole breast irradiation (WBI) consisted of 50 Gy in 25 fractions plus a 10 Gy in five fractions boost on tumour bed. A total of 520 patients were enrolled in the phase 3 trial. Overall, 205 patients (105 APBI and 100 WBI) fully completed all the given questionnaires and were therefore included in the present analysis. As HRQoL assessment, patients were asked to complete the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30, and the BR23 questionnaires at the beginning (T0), at the end (T1) and after 2 years from radiation (T2). FINDINGS: No significant difference between the two arms at QLQ-C30 and BR23 scores emerged at T0. Global health status (p = 0.0001), and most scores of the functional and symptom scales of QLQ-C30 at T1 showed significant differences in favour of the APBI arm. Concerning the BR23 functional and symptom scales, the body image perception, future perspective and breast and arm symptoms were significantly better in the APBI group. Similar significant results emerged at T2: significant differences in favour of APBI emerged for GHS (p = 0.0001), and most functional and symptom QLQ-C30 scales. According to QLQ-BR23 module, among the functional scales, the body image perception and the future perspective were significantly better in the APBI group (p = 0.0001), whereas among the symptom scales significant difference emerged by breast and arm symptoms with better outcomes in APBI arm (p < 0.01). INTERPRETATION: Early BC treated with APBI showed an improved short-term, and 2-year follow-up HRQoL outcome as compared with WBI. Early BC treated with APBI showed an improved short-term, and 2-year follow-up HRQoL outcome as compared with WBI. APBI should be strongly considered in the treatment choice for selected low-risk patients. Mature local control results from ongoing adequately powered randomised trials are awaited."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women age > 40 years with invasive or in situ breast cancer </= 3 cm were randomly assigned after breast-conserving surgery to 3D-CRT APBI (38.5 Gy in 10 fractions twice daily) or WBI (42.5 Gy in 16 or 50 Gy in 25 daily fractions +/- boost irradiation). The primary outcome was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Secondary outcomes were cosmesis and toxicity. Adverse cosmesis was defined as a fair or poor global cosmetic score. After a planned interim cosmetic analysis, the data, safety, and monitoring committee recommended release of results. There have been too few IBTR events to trigger an efficacy analysis. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2011, 2,135 women were randomly assigned to 3D-CRT APBI or WBI. Median follow-up was 36 months. Adverse cosmesis at 3 years was increased among those treated with APBI compared with WBI as assessed by trained nurses (29% v 17%; P < .001), by patients (26% v 18%; P = .0022), and by physicians reviewing digital photographs (35% v 17%; P < .001). Grade 3 toxicities were rare in both treatment arms (1.4% v 0%), but grade 1 and 2 toxicities were increased among those who received APBI compared with WBI (P < .001). CONCLUSION: 3D-CRT APBI increased rates of adverse cosmesis and late radiation toxicity compared with standard WBI. Clinicians and patients are cautioned against the use of 3D-CRT APBI outside the context of a controlled trial."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Subjects were trial participants with nurse-assessed global cosmetic scores at baseline and at 3 years. Adverse cosmesis was defined as a score of fair or poor. Cosmetic deterioration was defined as any adverse change in score from baseline to 3 years. The analysis is based on data from the previously reported interim analysis. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association of risk factors for these outcomes among all patients and those treated with APBI only. RESULTS: Clinicopathologic characteristics were similar between subjects randomized to APBI (n=569) or whole-breast irradiation (n=539). For all subjects, factors associated with adverse cosmesis at 3 years were older age, central/inner tumor location, breast infection, smoking, seroma volume, breast volume, and use of APBI; factors associated with cosmetic deterioration were smoking, seroma volume, and use of APBI (P<.05). For APBI subjects, tumor location, smoking, age, and seroma volume were associated with adverse cosmesis (P<.05), and smoking was associated with cosmetic deterioration (P=.02). An independent association between the V95/whole-breast volume ratio and adverse cosmesis (P=.28) or cosmetic deterioration (P=.07) was not detected. On further exploration a V95/whole-breast volume ratio <0.15 was associated with a lower risk of cosmetic deterioration (p=.04), but this accounted for only 11% of patients. CONCLUSION: In the RAPID trial, a number of patient tumor and treatment-related factors, including the use of APBI, were associated with adverse cosmesis and cosmetic deterioration. For patients treated with APBI alone, the high-dose treatment volume was not independently associated with an adverse cosmetic outcome, and a useful clinical threshold could not be identified."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: 102 patients with early-stage breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery were randomized to receive either WBI (n=51) or APBI (n=51). In the WBI arm, 48 Gy was delivered to the whole breast in daily fractions of 2 Gy, with or without additional 10 Gy to the tumor bed. In the APBI arm, patients received 37.5 Gy in 3.75 Gy per fraction delivered twice daily. Toxicity results were scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Common Toxicity Criteria. Skin elasticity was measured using a dedicated device (Multi-Skin-Test-Center MC-750-B2, CKelectronic-GmbH). Cosmetic results were assessed by the physician and the patients as good/excellent, regular, or poor. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 5 years. No local recurrences were observed. No significant differences in survival rates were found. APBI reduced acute side effects and radiation doses to healthy tissues compared with WBI (P<.01). Late skin toxicity was no worse than grade 2 in either group, without significant differences between the 2 groups. In the ipsilateral breast, the areas that received the highest doses (ie, the boost or quadrant) showed the greatest loss of elasticity. WBI resulted in a greater loss of elasticity in the high-dose area compared with APBI (P<.05). Physician assessment showed that >75% of patients in the APBI arm had excellent or good cosmesis, and these outcomes appear to be stable over time. The percentage of patients with excellent/good cosmetic results was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: APBI delivered by 3D-CRT to the tumor bed for a selected group of early-stage breast cancer patients produces 5-year results similar to those achieved with conventional WBI."

Treatment plans of 20 patients with left-sided breast cancer, 10 post-mastectomy treated to a prescribed dose of 45 Gy to the chest wall in 20 fractions, and 10 post-breast-conserving surgery to a prescribed dose of 50 Gy to the whole breast in 25 fractions, with 3D-CRT were selected. The FiF-FP-IMRT plans were created by combining two open fields with three to four segments in two tangential beam directions. Eight different beam directions were chosen to create IP-IMRT plans and were inversely optimized. The homogeneity of dose to planning target volume (PTV) and the dose delivered to heart and contralateral breast were compared among the techniques in all the 20 patients. All the three radiotherapy techniques achieved comparable radiation dose delivery to PTV-95% of the prescribed dose covering > 95% of the breast PTV. The mean volume of PTV receiving 105% (V105) of the prescribed dose was 1.7% (range 0-6.8%) for IP-IMRT, 1.9% for FP-IMRT, and 3.7% for 3D-CRT. The homogeneity and conformity indices (HI and CI) were similar for 3D-CRT and FP-IMRT, whereas the IP-IMRT plans had better conformity index at the cost of less homogeneity. The 3D-CRT and FiF-FP-IMRT plans achieved similar sparing of critical organs. The low-dose volumes (V5Gy) in the heart and lungs were larger in IP-IMRT than in the other techniques. The value of the mean dose to the ipsilateral lung was higher for IP-IMRT than the values for with FiF-FP-IMRT and 3D-CRT. In the current study, the relative volume of contralateral breast receiving low doses (0.01, 0.6, 1, and 2Gy) was significantly lower for the FiF-FP-IMRT and 3D-CRT plans than for the IP-IMRT plan. Compared with 3D-CRT and IP-IMRT, FiF-FP-IMRT proved to be a simple and efficient planning technique for breast irradiation. It provided dosimetric advantages, significantly reducing the size of the hot spot and minimally improving the coverage of the target volume. In addition, it was felt that FiF-FP-IMRT required less planning time and easy field placements."

Pichandi, A.",2012,Accelerated partial breast irradiation using external beam radiotherapy-A feasibility study based on dosimetric analysis,Apbi Dose conformity Dose homogeneity Multicatheter ISBT,1,251,eng,"AIM: To investigate the feasibility of using External Beam radiotherapy for accelerated partial breast irradiation by a comparative tumour and normal tissue dose volume analysis with that of high dose rate interstitial brachytherapy. BACKGROUND: Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) is more clinically appealing because of the reduced treatment course duration and the irradiated area. Brachytherapy application is more dependent on the clinician's expertise when it is practised free hand without image guidance and a template. It happens to be an invasive procedure with the use of local anaesthesia which adds patient discomfort apart from its cost compared to External Beam Radiotherapy. But APBI with brachytherapy is more commonly practised procedure compared to EBRT owing to its previous reults. Hence in this research study, we intend to explore the use of EBRT with the radiobiological corrections for APBI in the place of brachytherapy. It is done as a dosimetric comparison of Brachytherapy treatment plans with that of EBRT plans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The computed tomography images of 15 patients undergoing ISBT planning were simulated with conformal photon fields. Various dose volume parameters of each structure were obtained from the DVH generated in the brachytherapy and the simulated external beam planning which can correlate well with the late toxicity. The plan quality indices such as conformity index and homogeneity index for the target volume were computed from the dosimetric factors. The statistical p values for CI, HI and normal tissue dosimetric parameters were calculated and the confidence levels achievable were analysed. The dose prescribed in brachytherapy was 3400cGy in ten fractions. The equivalent prescription dose for the external beam radiotherapy planning was 3000cGy in five fractions applied with radiobiological correction. RESULTS: All the fifteen patients were with complete lung data and six were with left sided tumours having complete cardiac data. The lung dosimetry data and the cardiac dosimetry data of the patients were studied. Lower percentages of lung and cardiac V 20 and V 5 volumes were obtained with conformal planning. The conformity of radiation dose to the tumour volume was akin to the interstitial brachytherapy planning. Moreover the external beam planning resulted in more homogenous dose distribution. For the sampled population, the statistical analysis showed a confidence level of 95% for using EBRT as an alternate to multi catheter ISBT. CONCLUSION: The EBRT planning for Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation was found to be technically feasible in the institution where the interstitial brachytherapy happens to be the only available technique as evident from the dose volume parameters and the statistical analysis."

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is increasingly used during breast conserving surgery. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate secondary cancer risks after IORT compared to other modalities of breast radiotherapy (APBI - accelerated partial breast irradiation, EBRT - external beam radiotherapy). METHODS: Computer-tomography scans of an anthropomorphic phantom were acquired with an INTRABEAM IORT applicator (diameter 4 cm) in the outer quadrant of the breast and transferred via DICOM to the treatment planning system. Ipsilateral breast, contralateral breast, ipsilateral lung, contralateral lung, spine and heart were contoured. An INTRABEAM source (50 kV) was defined with the tip of the drift tube at the center of the spherical applicator. A dose of 20 Gy at 0 mm depth from the applicator surface was prescribed for IORT and 34 Gy (5 days x 2 x 3.4 Gy) at 10 mm depth for APBI. For EBRT a total dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions was planned using two tangential fields with wedges. The mean and maximal doses, DVHs and volumes receiving more than 0.1 Gy and 4 Gy of organs at risk (OAR) were calculated and compared. The life time risk for secondary cancers was estimated according to NCRP report 116. RESULTS: IORT delivered the lowest maximal doses to contralateral breast (< 0.3 Gy), ipsilateral (1.8 Gy) and contralateral lung (< 0.3 Gy), heart (1 Gy) and spine (< 0.3 Gy). In comparison, maximal doses for APBI were 2-5 times higher. EBRT delivered a maximal dose of 10.4 Gy to the contralateral breast and 53 Gy to the ipsilateral lung. OAR volumes receiving more than 4 Gy were 0% for IORT, < 2% for APBI and up to 10% for EBRT (ipsilateral lung). The estimated risk for secondary cancer in the respective OAR is considerably lower after IORT and/or APBI as compared to EBRT. CONCLUSIONS: The calculations for maximal doses and volumes of OAR suggest that the risk of secondary cancer induction after IORT is lower than compared to APBI and EBRT."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 2007 to September 2009, 30 early breast cancer patients were enrolled in a 3D-conformal APBI Phase II trial (40 Gy/10 fractions/5 days). Treatment related toxicities and cosmetic results were assessed by both patients and physicians at each visit (at 1, 2, 6 months, and then every 6 months). Patient satisfaction was also scored. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 27.7 months, all patients were satisfied with APBI treatment, regardless of cosmetic results or late adverse events. Good/excellent cosmetic results were noticed by 80% of patients versus 92% of cases by radiation oncologists. Breast pain was systematically underestimated by physicians (8-20% vs. 16.6-26.2%; Kappa coefficient KC=0.16-0.44). Grade 1 and 2 fibrosis and/or breast retraction occurred in 7-12% of patients and were overestimated by patients (KC=0.14-0.27). CONCLUSIONS: Present results have shown discrepancies between patient and physician assessments. In addition to the assessment of efficacy and toxicity after 3D-conformal APBI, patients' cosmetic results consideration and satisfaction should be also evaluated."

METHODS: 12 patients (Stage I, 8: 6 left breast cancer and 2 right breast cancer; Stage II, 4: 2 on each side). Three plans were calculated for each case after breast-conserving surgery. Breast was treated with 50 Gy in four patients with supraclavicular lymph node inclusion, and in eight patients without the node inclusion. Multiple indices and dose parameters were measured. RESULTS: V95% was not achieved by any modality. Heterogeneity index: 0.16 (VMAT), 0.13 [intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)] and 0.14 (conTFRT). Conformity index: 1.06 (VMAT), 1.15 (IMRT) and 1.69 (conTFRT). For both indices, IMRT was more effective than VMAT (p=0.009, p=0.002). Dmean and V20 for ipsilateral lung were lower for IMRT than VMAT (p=0.0001, p=0.003). Dmean, V2 and V5 of contralateral lung were lower for IMRT than VMAT (p>0.0001, p=0.005). Mean dose and V5 to the heart were lower for IMRT than for VMAT (p=0.015, p=0.002). CONCLUSION: The hypothesis of equivalence of VMAT to IMRT was not confirmed for planning target volume parameter or dose distribution to organs at risk. VMAT was inferior to IMRT and 3D-CRT with regard to dose distribution to organs at risk, especially at the low dose level. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: New technology VMAT is not superior to IMRT or conventional radiotherapy in breast cancer in any aspect."

Two algorithms of iPlan BrainLAB treatment planning system were compared: Pencil Beam Convolution (PBC) and commercial Monte Carlo (iMC). Seven left-sided breast patients submitted to breast-conserving surgery were enrolled in the study. For each patient, four RT techniques--f-IMRT, IMRT using 2-fields and 5-fields (IMRT2 and IMRT5, respectively) and DCART - were applied. The dose distributions in the planned target volume (PTV) and the dose to the organs at risk (OAR) were compared analyzing dose-volume histograms; further statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS v20 software. For PBC, all techniques provided adequate coverage of the PTV. However, statistically significant dose differences were observed between the techniques, in the PTV, OAR and also in the pattern of dose distribution spreading into normal tissues. IMRT5 and DCART spread low doses into greater volumes of normal tissue, right breast, right lung and heart than tangential techniques. However, IMRT5 plans improved distributions for the PTV, exhibiting better conformity and homogeneity in target and reduced high dose percentages in ipsilateral OAR. DCART did not present advantages over any of the techniques investigated. Differences were also found comparing the calculation algorithms: PBC estimated higher doses for the PTV, ipsilateral lung and heart than the iMC algorithm predicted."

Four techniques are available to deliver PBI. These include interstitial brachytherapy multicatheter systems, the Mammosite Radiation Therapy System applicator, external beam three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and intraoperative radiation therapy. For the two brachytherapy techniques of multicatheter implantation and the Mammosite, accurate placement is achieved with image guidance via intraoperative ultrasonography, mammography, and/or CT scanning. Technologies such as image-guided cone beam CT assure accurate delivery of PBI with external beam three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy. Results of PBI show excellent control rates with mild toxicities; cosmetic outcomes are good to excellent in the vast majority of patients."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 20 patients (10 in the breast-conserving surgery group and 10 post-mastectomy patients with tissue expander implants) was investigated. Proton plans were also computed using robust optimisation methods. Plan quality was assessed by means of dose-volume histograms and scored with conventional metrics. Estimates of the risk of secondary cancer induction (excess absolute risk, EAR) were carried out, taking into account fractionation, repopulation and repair. RESULTS: Concerning target coverage, the data proved a substantial equivalence of VMAT and IMPT: for example, coverage for the 50 Gy target, expressed in terms of V98%, was 47.8 +/- 0.4, 47.6 +/- 0.4, 47.3 +/- 0.8, consistent with the objective of 47.5 Gy, for post-mastectomy patients for the three groups of patients. Also, the conformality of the dose distributions was similar for the two techniques, about 1.1, without statistically significant differences. Organ at risk planning aims were achieved for all structures for both techniques. The mean dose to the ipsilateral lung was 10.8 +/- 1.1, 6.2 +/- 0.8, 7.2 +/- 1.0; for the contralateral lung was 3.2 +/- 0.7, 0.3 +/- 0.2, 0.4 +/- 0.2; for the contralateral breast was: 3.1 +/- 0.7, 0.3 +/- 0.3 and 0.3 +/- 0.3, whereas it was 3.9 +/- 0.9, 0.4 +/- 0.3 and 0.5 +/- 0.5, respectively, for the heart for VMAT, IMPT and robust IMPT plans over the whole group of patients. Robust optimisation affected the near-to-maximum dose values for contralateral lung and breast, the mean dose for the heart and ipsilateral lung, with a deterioration ranging from 20 to 40% of the nominal value of IMPT plans (e.g. from 8.1 +/- 6.4 to 11.4 +/- 8.8 for the heart compared with 16.2 +/- 5.2 for the VMAT plans). The numerical values of EAR per 10 000 patient-years were about one order of magnitude higher for VMAT than for IMPT for contralateral structures: 11.66 +/- 2.01, 0.89 +/- 0.80, 0.98 +/- 0.77 for the contralateral breast and the three groups of plans, respectively; 14.31 +/- 2.75, 1.42 +/- 0.80, 1.78 +/- 0.87 for the contralateral lung; and 34.86 +/- 2.64, 18.85 +/- 2.15, 20.98 +/- 2.35 for the ipsilateral lung. CONCLUSION: IMPT with or without robust optimisation seems to be a potentially promising approach for the radiation treatment of breast cancer when nodal volumes should be irradiated. This was measured in terms of dosimetric advantage and predicted clinical benefit. In fact, the significant reduction in estimated EAR could add further clinical value to the dosimetric sparing of the organs at risk achievable with IMPT."

METHODS: Patients with 1 to 2 positive SLNs undergoing breast-conserving therapy, without ALND, were included in the analysis. For each patient, 3 treatment plans were performed: a 3D conventional tangential plan, a static IMRT plan, and a volumetric IMRT, designed to encompass the entire breast parenchyma. The volumes of axillary levels I, II, and III receiving 90% and 95% (V90, V95) of the whole breast prescribed dose were evaluated. Dose-volume histograms were compared by means of the Friedman test.

These may contribute to clinically significant late radiation adverse effects. AIM: To test three dimensional (3D) intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) against 2D dosimetry using standard wedge compensators in terms of late adverse effects after whole breast radiotherapy. METHODS: Three hundred and six women prescribed whole breast radiotherapy after tumour excision for early stage cancer were randomised to 3D IMRT (test arm) or 2D radiotherapy delivered using standard wedge compensators (control arm). All patients were treated with 6 or 10MV photons to a dose of 50Gy in 25 fractions to 100% in 5 weeks followed by an electron boost to the tumour bed of 11.1Gy in 5 fractions to 100%. The primary endpoint was change in breast appearance scored from serial photographs taken before radiotherapy and at 1, 2 and 5 years follow up. Secondary endpoints included patient self-assessments of breast discomfort, breast hardness, quality of life and physician assessments of breast induration. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS: 240 (79%) patients with 5-year photographs were available for analysis. Change in breast appearance was identified in 71/122 (58%) allocated standard 2D treatment compared to only 47/118 (40%) patients allocated 3D IMRT. The control arm patients were 1.7 times more likely to have a change in breast appearance than the IMRT arm patients after adjustment for year of photographic assessment (95% confidence interval 1.2-2.5, p=0.008). Significantly fewer patients in the 3D IMRT group developed palpable induration assessed clinically in the centre of the breast, pectoral fold, infra-mammary fold and at the boost site. No significant differences between treatment groups were found in patient reported breast discomfort, breast hardness or quality of life. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that minimisation of unwanted radiation dose inhomogeneity in the breast reduces late adverse effects. Incidence of change in breast appearance was statistically significantly higher in patients in the standard 2D treatment arm compared with the IMRT arm.

The role of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and voluntary moderately deep inspiration breath-hold (vmDIBH) techniques in further reducing irradiated healthy--especially heart--tissue is investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For 37 partial breast planning target volumes (PTVs), three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) (3-5 coplanar or non-coplanar 6 and/or 10 MV beams) and VMAT (two partial 6 MV arcs) plans were made on CTs acquired in free-breathing (FB) and/or in vmDIBH. Dose-volume parameters for the PTV, heart, lungs, and breasts were compared. RESULTS: Better dose conformity was achieved with VMAT compared to 3D-CRT (conformity index 1.24+/-0.09 vs. 1.49+/-0.20). Non-PTV ipsilateral breast receiving >/=50% of the prescribed dose was on average reduced by 28% in VMAT plans compared to 3D-CRT plans. Mean heart dose (MHD) reduced from 2.0 (0.1-5.1) Gy in 3D-CRT(FB) to 0.6 (0.1-1.6) Gy in VMAT(vmDIBH). VMAT is beneficial for MHD reduction if MHD with 3D-CRT exceeds 0.5Gy. Cardiac dose reduction as a result of VMAT increases with increasing initial MHD, and adding vmDIBH reduces the cardiac dose further. Mean dose to the ipsilateral lung decreased from 3.7 (0.7-8.7) to 1.8 (0.5-4.0) Gy with VMAT(vmDIBH) compared to 3D-CRT(FB). VMAT resulted in a slight increase in the contralateral breast dose (DMean) always remaining <1.9 Gy). CONCLUSIONS: For APBI patients, VMAT improves PTV dose conformity and delivers lower doses to the ipsilateral breast and lung compared to 3D-CRT. This goes at the cost of a slight but acceptable increase of the contralateral breast dose. VMAT reduces cardiac dose if MHD exceeds 0.5 Gy for 3D-CRT. Adding vmDIBH results in a further reduction of heart and ipsilateral lung dose."

To enhance the conformity of EBRT APBI, a technique for conventional LINACs is developed, which through combined motion of the couch, intensity modulated delivery, and a prone breast setup, enables wide-angular coronal arc irradiation of the ipsilateral breast without irradiating through the thorax and contralateral breast. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A couch trajectory optimization technique was developed to determine the trajectories that concurrently avoid collision with the LINAC and maintain the target within the MLC apertures. Inverse treatment planning was performed along the derived trajectory. The technique was experimentally implemented by programming the Varian TrueBeam STx in Developer Mode. The dosimetric accuracy of the delivery was evaluated by ion chamber and film measurements in phantom. RESULTS: The resulting optimized trajectory was shown to be necessarily non-isocentric, and contain both translation and rotations of the couch. Film measurements resulted in 93% of the points in the measured two-dimensional dose maps passing the 3%/3mm Gamma criterion. Preliminary treatment plan comparison to 5-field 3D-conformal, IMRT, and VMAT demonstrated enhancement in conformity, and reduction of the normal tissue V50% and V100% parameters that have been correlated with EBRT toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of wide-angular intensity modulated partial breast irradiation using motion of the couch has been demonstrated experimentally on a standard LINAC for the first time. For patients eligible for a prone setup, the technique may enable improvement of dose conformity and associated dose-volume parameters correlated with toxicity."

The study aimed to determine efficacy, acute and late side effects, and the preference of photon vs electron irradiation based on individual features. Patients were enrolled according to internationally accepted guidelines on PBI. Conformal radiotherapy plans were generated with both photon and electron beams, and the preferred technique based on dose homogeneity and the radiation exposure of healthy tissues was applied. For electron dose verification, a special phantom was constructed. Patients were randomized for fractionation schedules of 25 x 2 vs 13 x 3Gy. Skin and breast changes were registered at the time of and >/=1 year after the completion of radiotherapy. Dose homogeneity was better with photons. If the tumor bed was located in the inner quadrants, electron beam gave superior results regarding conformity and sparing of organ at risk (OAR). If the tumor was situated in the lateral quadrants, conformity was better with photons. A depth of the tumor bed >/=3.0cm predicted the superiority of photon irradiation (odds ratio [OR] = 23.6, 95% CI: 5.2 to 107.5, p < 0.001) with >90% sensitivity and specificity. After a median follow-up of 39 months, among 72 irradiated cases, 1 local relapse out of the tumor bed was detected. Acute radiodermatitis of grade I to II, hyperpigmentation, and telangiectasia developed >/=1 year after radiotherapy, exclusively after electron beam radiotherapy. The choice of electrons or photons for PBI should be based on tumor bed location; the used methods are efficient and feasible."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two VMAT arrangements (VMAT_tang and VMAT_full, i.e. partial arcs with and without a sector of 0 Monitor Unit, respectively) and a 3D CRT (field-in-field [FinF]) plan were calculated with an accurate dose calculation algorithm, Acuros, in 20 patients presenting with early-stage breast cancer. The dose prescription was 40.05 Gy in 15 fractions. The planning aim was to maximize the dose reduction in the lungs, contralateral breast, heart, and coronary artery. EAR was estimated using different models: linear, linear-exponential, plateau, and full model, which better uses a carcinogenesis model and epidemiologic data for carcinoma induction and which accounts for cell repopulation or repair during the radiation therapy dose fractionation. EAR was computed for contralateral structures-breast and lung-as well as the ipsilateral lung. Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was computed to estimate the ipsilateral lung, heart, and skin toxicity, to balance with respect to second cancer induction. RESULTS: The planning objectives were fulfilled with all the planning techniques. EAR for contralateral breast carcinoma induction, estimated with the most accurate model, was 1.7, 2.4, and 8.5 (per 10,000 patients per year) with FinF, VMAT_tang, and VMAT_full, respectively. For the contralateral lung, these figures were 1.5, 1.6, and 7.3 (per 10,000 patients per year), respectively. NTCP for all the analyzed endpoints was significantly higher with FinF relative to both VMAT settings, with VMAT_full presenting the lowest toxicity risk. CONCLUSIONS: VMAT, in particular with the VMAT_tang setting, could have the same risk of second cancer induction as 3D CRT delivered with the FinF setting for the contralateral organs while reducing acute and late NTCP for the ipsilateral organs. VMAT might be considered a safe technique for breast cancer treatment for those aspects."

Recently, CyberKnife has emerged as a possible alternative to conventional techniques for accelerated partial breast irradiation. In this retrospective study, we present a dosimetric comparison between 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans and CyberKnife plans using circular (Iris) and multi-leaf collimators. Nine patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgery followed by whole breast radiation were included in this retrospective study. The CyberKnife planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the lumpectomy cavity + 10 mm + 2 mm with prescription dose of 30 Gy in 5 fractions. Two sets of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans were created, one used the same definitions as described for CyberKnife and the second used the RTOG-0413 definition of the PTV: lumpectomy cavity + 15 mm + 10 mm with prescription dose of 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions. Using both PTV definitions allowed us to compare the dose delivery capabilities of each technology and to evaluate the advantage of CyberKnife tracking. For the dosimetric comparison using the same PTV margins, CyberKnife and 3-dimensional plans resulted in similar tumor coverage and dose to critical structures, with the exception of the lung V5%, which was significantly smaller for 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, 6.2% when compared to 39.4% for CyberKnife-Iris and 17.9% for CyberKnife-multi-leaf collimator. When the inability of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy to track motion is considered, the result increased to 25.6%. Both CyberKnife-Iris and CyberKnife-multi-leaf collimator plans demonstrated significantly lower average ipsilateral breast V50% (25.5% and 24.2%, respectively) than 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (56.2%). The CyberKnife plans were more conformal but less homogeneous than the 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans. Approximately 50% shorter treatment times and 50% lower number of delivered monitor units (MU) were achievable with CyberKnife-multi-leaf collimator than with CyberKnife-Iris. The CyberKnife-multi-leaf collimator treatment times were comparable to 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, however, the number of MU delivered was approximately 2.5 times larger. The suitability of 10 + 2 mm margins warrants further investigation."

METHODS: Between 2011 and 2016 women >/=60 years undergoing breast conserving therapy for early stage breast cancer were included in a prospective multi-centre cohort study. Patients were treated with electron IORT (1x23.3Gy) or photon EB-APBI (10x3.85Gy daily). HRQL was measured by the EORTC-QLQ C30 and BR23 questionnaires before surgery and at several time points until 1 year. RESULTS: HRQoL data was available of 204 IORT and 158EB-APBI patients. In longitudinal analyses emotional functioning and future perspective were significantly, but not clinically relevantly, worse in IORT-treated patients, and improved significantly during follow-up in both groups. All other aspects of HRQL slightly worsened after treatment and recovered within 3 months with an improvement until 1 year. Cross-sectional analysis showed that postoperatively fatigue and role functioning were significantly worse in IORT patients compared to EB-APBI patients who were not yet irradiated, but the difference was not clinically relevant. At other timepoints there were no significant differences. Multivariable analysis at 1 year identified comorbidity and systemic therapy as risk factors for a worse global health score (GHS). CONCLUSIONS: EB-APBI and IORT were well tolerated. Despite a temporary deterioration after treatment, all HRQL scales recovered within 3 months resulting in no clinically relevant differences until 1 year between groups nor compared to baseline levels."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We enrolled breast cancer patients in an institutional review board-approved prospective study of APBI using beamlet intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) at deep-inspiration breath-hold. Patients received 38.5 Gy in 3.85 Gy fractions twice daily. Dosimetric parameters in patients who maintained acceptable cosmesis were compared with those in patients developing unacceptable cosmesis in follow-up, using t-tests. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled; 2 were excluded from analysis because of fair baseline cosmesis. With a median follow-up of 2.5 years, new unacceptable cosmesis developed in 7 patients, leading to early study closure. We compared patients with new unacceptable cosmesis with those with consistently acceptable cosmesis. Retrospective analysis demonstrated that all but one plan adhered to the dosimetric requirements of the national APBI trial. The mean proportion of a whole-breast reference volume receiving 19.25 Gy (V50) was lower in patients with acceptable cosmesis than in those with unacceptable cosmesis (34.6% vs. 46.1%; p = 0.02). The mean percentage of this reference volume receiving 38.5 Gy (V100) was also lower in patients with acceptable cosmesis (15.5% vs. 23.0%; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The hypofractionated schedule and parameters commonly used for external beam APBI and prescribed by the ongoing national trial may be suboptimal, at least when highly conformal techniques such as IMRT with management of breathing motion are used. The V50 and V100 of the breast reference volume seem correlated with cosmetic outcome, and stricter limits may be appropriate in this setting."

Recent advances in MRI-Linac solutions have potential in being applied to HPBI due to gains in the soft tissue contrast of MRI; however, there are potentially deleterious effects of the magnetic field on the dose distribution. The purpose of this work is to determine the effects of the magnetic field on the dose distribution for HPBI tumors using a tangential beam arrangement (TAN), 5-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). METHODS: Five patients who have received HPBI were selected with two patients having bilateral disease resulting in a total of two tumors in this study. Six planning configurations were created using a treatment planning system capable of modeling magnetic field dose effects: TAN, IMRT and VMAT beam geometries, each of these optimized with and without a transverse magnetic field of 1.5 T. RESULTS: The heart and lung doses were not statistically significant when comparing plan configurations. The magnetic field had a demonstrated effect on skin dose: for VMAT plans, the skin (defined to a depth of 3 mm) D1cc was elevated by +11% and the V30 by +146%; for IMRT plans, the skin D1cc was increased by +18% and the V30 by +149%. Increasing the number of beam angles (e.g., going from IMRT to VMAT) with the magnetic field on reduced the skin dose. CONCLUSION: The impact of a magnetic field on HPBI dose distributions was analyzed. The heart and lung doses had clinically negligible effects caused by the magnetic field. The magnetic field increases the skin dose; however, this can be mitigated by increasing the number of beam angles."

Tumor locations were classified into 8 subsections according to breast quadrant and depth. Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), electron beam therapy (ET), and helical tomotherapy (H-TOMO) were utilized to evaluate the dosimetric effect for each tumor location. Conformation number (CN), radical dose homogeneity index (rDHI), and dose delivered to healthy tissue were estimated.

The ET approach showed good sparing effects and acceptable target coverage for the lower inner quadrant-superficial (LIQ-S) and lower inner quadrant-deep (LIQ-D) locations. The H-TOMO method was the least effective technique as no evaluation index achieved superiority for all tumor locations except CN. The ET method is advisable for treating LIQ-S and LIQ-D tumors, as opposed to 3D-CRT or H-TOMO, because of acceptable target coverage and much lower dose applied to surrounding tissue."

The differences among the treatments were also statistically compared regarding dosimetry distribution and treatment efficiency. The research was conducted with 10 SBBC patients. The study established IMRT (12 fields with a single isocenter) and VMAT (2 partial arcs with a single isocenter) treatment plans for SBBC patients and then compared those plans with 3DCRT (8 fields with multiple isocenters). The plans were evaluated based on a dose-volume histogram analysis. For planning target volumes (PTVs), the mean doses and the values of V95%, V105%, conformity index, and homogeneity index were reported. For the organs at risk, the analysis included the mean dose, maximum dose, and VXGy, depending on the organs (lungs, heart, and liver). To objectively evaluate the efficiency of the treatment plans, each plan's beam times, treatment times (including set-up time), and monitor units were compared. Tukey test and one-way analysis of variance were used to compare the PTV and organs at risk values of the 3 techniques. Additionally, the independent-samples t-test was used to compare the 2 techniques (IMRT and VMAT) based on the values of Rt. PTV and Lt. PTV (p < 0.05). For PTV dose distribution, IMRT showed increases of approximately 1.2% in Dmean and of approximately 5.7% in V95% dose distribution compared with 3DCRT. In comparison to VMAT, 3DCRT showed about 3.0% higher dose distribution in Dmean and V95%. IMRT was the best in terms of conformity index and homogeneity index (p < 0.05), whereas 3DCRT and VMAT did not significantly differ from each other. In terms of dose distribution on lungs, heart, and liver, the percentage of volume at high doses such as V30Gy and V40Gy was approximately 70% lower for IMRT and approximately 40% lower for VMAT than for 3DCRT. For distribution volumes of low doses such as V5% and V10%, that for 3DCRT was approximately 60% smaller than for IMRT and approximately 70% smaller than for VMAT. Comparison between IMRT and VMAT showed that the IMRT was superior in all distribution factors. VMAT showed better treatment efficiency than 3DCRT or IMRT. Among the SBBC radiotherapy treatment plans, IMRT was superior to 3DCRT and VMAT in terms of PTV dose distribution, whereas VMAT showed the most outstanding treatment efficiency."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen patients with Stage I breast cancer had PBI treatment plans generated using the multiple, noncoplanar photon field technique and the three-field, mixed-modality technique. Planning target volumes (PTVs; lumpectomy site plus 1.5-2.0 cm margin) and total dose (32 Gy) were held constant to facilitate dosimetric comparisons. Plans were optimized for conformality and PTV coverage. RESULTS: Mixed-modality plans employed fewer fields than multiple, noncoplanar photon field plans (mean 3.2 vs. 4.1). Both techniques provided comparable PTV coverage and in all cases, 95% of the PTV received 90% of the prescribed dose. Volumes of ipsilateral breast receiving greater than 16 Gy were similar; however, the mean volume of ipsilateral breast receiving 8 Gy was significantly lower for mixed-modality plans (58% vs. 66%). No differences in the volumes of ipsilateral lung or heart receiving greater than 5 Gy were observed, however, the mixed-modality technique delivered 2.5 Gy to larger volumes of these organs. CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques for supine position, 3D-CPBI provides excellent normal tissue sparing with adequate PTV coverage. The multiple, noncoplanar photon field technique exposes smaller volumes of ipsilateral lung and heart to low dose radiation at the expense of increased plan complexity and larger irradiated breast volumes."

To facilitate dosimetric comparisons, planning target volumes (PTVs; lumpectomy site plus 1.5-2.0 cm margin) and prescribed dose (32 Gy) were held constant.

RESULTS: Proton and mixed-modality plans both provided acceptable PTV coverage with 95% of the PTV receiving 90% of the prescribed dose in all cases. Both techniques also provided excellent dose homogeneity with a dose maximum exceeding 110% of the prescribed dose in only one case. Proton 3D-CPBI reduced the volume of nontarget breast tissue receiving 50% of the prescribed dose by an average of 36%. Statistically significant reductions in the volume of total ipsilateral breast receiving 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of the prescribed dose were also observed. The use of protons resulted in small, but statistically significant, reductions in the radiation dose delivered to 5%, 10%, and 20% of ipsilateral and contralateral lung and heart. The nontarget breast tissue dosimetric advantages of proton 3D-CPBI were not dependent on tumor location, breast size, PTV size, or the ratio of PTV to breast volume. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to photon-electron 3D-CPBI, proton 3D-CPBI significantly reduces the volume of irradiated nontarget breast tissue. Both approaches to accelerated partial breast irradiation offer exceptional lung and heart sparing."

Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) is also an approach to post-lumpectomy radiation for early breast cancer. AIM: The purpose of this study is to compare two different external-beam APBI techniques using three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), with conventional whole-breast irradiation based on the radiation conformity index, dose homogeneity index, and dose to organs at risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WBI treatment plans were compared with two different 3DCRT APBI plans for each of 15 patients (8 with right sided lesions, 7 with left sided lesions). The first APBI plan (APBI 1) used two small coplanar fields conformed to the planning target volume (PTV) using multileaf collimators (MLCs) and wedges, while the other APBI plan (APBI 2) used three non-coplanar fields conformed to the PTV using MLCs and wedges. RESULTS: Both the APBI techniques improved the conformity index significantly over whole-breast tangents while maintaining dose homogeneity and not causing significant increase in dose to organs at risk. CONCLUSION: Both the 3DCRT APBI techniques are technically feasible and dosimetrically appealing,with better target coverage and relative sparing of normal critical organs."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with breast cancer (half right-sided and half left-sided) treated by conservative lumpectomy and requiring whole breast radiotherapy with tumor bed boost were planned with three different radiotherapy techniques: 1) VMAT1; 2) VMAT2; 3) M-IMRT. The distributions for the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were compared. Dosimetries for all the techniques were compared. RESULTS: All three techniques satisfied the dose constraint well. VMAT2 showed no obvious difference in the homogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) of the PTV with respect to M-IMRT and VMAT1. VMAT2 clearly improved the treatment efficiency and can also decrease the mean dose and V5Gy of the contralateral lung. The mean dose and maximum dose of the spinal cord and contralateral breast were lower for VMAT2 than the other two techniques. The very low dose distribution (V1Gy) of the contralateral breast also showed great reduction in VMAT2 compared with the other two techniques. For the ipsilateral lung of right-sided breast cancer, the mean dose was decreased significantly in VMAT2 compared with VMAT1 and M-IMRT. The V20Gy and V30Gy of the ipsilateral lung of the left- sided breast cancer for VMAT2 showed obvious reduction compared with the other two techniques. The heart statistics of VMAT2 also decreased considerably compared to VMAT1 and M-IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the other two techniques, the dual arc volumetric modulated arc therapy technique reduced radiation dose exposure to the organs at risk and maintained a reasonable target dose distribution."

We created the 3 different PMRMRT plans for each of the ten consecutive patients. We performed Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Dunn's-type multiple comparisons to establish a hierarchy in terms of plan quality and dosimetric benefits. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both 5F-IMRT and 2P-VMAT plans exhibited similar PTV coverage (V95%), hotspot areas (V110%) and conformity (all p > 0.05), and significantly higher PTV coverage compared with 3DCRT-FinF (both p < 0.001). In addition, 5F-IMRT plans provided significantly less heart and left lung radiation exposure than 2P-VMAT (all p < 0.05). The 3DCRT-FinF plans with accurately estimated CTV displacement exhibited enhanced target coverage but worse organs at risk (OARs) sparing compared with those plans with underestimated displacements. Our results indicate that 5F-IMRT has dosimetrical advantages compared with the other two techniques in PMRMRT for left-sided breast cancer given its optimal balance between PTV coverage and OAR sparing (especially heart sparing). Individually quantifying and minimizing CTV displacement can significantly improve dosage distribution."

Multiple studies have shown that recurrences after lumpectomy occur mainly in or near the tumor bed. Use of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) allows for significant reduction in the overall treatment time that results in increasing patient compliance and decreasing healthcare costs. We conducted a treatment planning study to evaluate the role of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with regards to three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) in APBI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computed tomography planning data sets of 33 patients (20 right sided and 13 left sided) with tumor size less than 3 cm and negative axillary lymph nodes were used for our study. Tumor location was upper outer, upper inner, central, lower inner, and lower outer quadrants in 10, 10, 5, 4 and 4 patients, respectively. Multiple 3DCRT and IMRT plans were created for each patient. Total dose of 38.5 Gy in 10 fractions were planned. Dosimetric analysis was done for the best 3DCRT and IMRT plans. RESULTS: The target coverage has been achieved by both the methods but IMRT provided better coverage (P = 0.04) with improved conformity index (P = 0.01). Maximum doses were well controlled in IMRT to below 108% (P < 0.01). Heart V2 Gy (P < 0.01), lung V5 Gy (P = 0.01), lung V10 Gy (P = 0.02), contralateral breast V1 Gy (P < 0.01), contralateral lung V2 Gy (P < 0.01), and ipsilateral uninvolved breast (P < 0.01) doses were higher with 3DCRT compared to IMRT.

We hypothesized that delivery of external beam PBI in a single fraction to the preoperative tumor volume would be feasible and result in a decreased dose to the uninvolved breast compared with institutional postoperative PBI historical controls. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 17 patients with unifocal Stage T1 breast cancer were identified. Contrast-enhanced subtraction magnetic resonance images were loaded into an Eclipse treatment planning system and used to define the target volumes. A virtual plan"" was created using four photon beams in a noncoplanar beam arrangement and optimized to deliver 15 Gy to the planning target volume. RESULTS: The median breast volume was 1,713 cm(3) (range: 1,014-2,140), and the median clinical target volume was 44 cm(3) (range: 26-73). In all cases, 100% of the prescription dose covered 95% of the clinical target volume. The median conformity index was 0.86 (range: 0.70-1.12). The median percentage of the ipsilateral breast volume receiving 100% and 50% of the prescribed dose was 3.8% (range: 2.2-6.9) and 13.3% (range: 7.5-20.8) compared with 18% (range: 3-42) and 53% (range: 24-65) in the institutional historical controls treated with postoperative external beam PBI (p = .002). The median maximum skin dose was 9 Gy. The median dose to 1 and 10 cm(3) of skin was 6.7 and 4.9 Gy. The doses to the heart and ipsilateral lung were negligible. CONCLUSION: Preoperative PBI resulted in a substantial reduction in ipsilateral breast tissue dose compared with postoperative PBI. The skin dose appeared reasonable, given the small volumes. A prospective Phase I trial evaluating this technique is ongoing."""

Early stage node-negative breast cancer (ESNNBC) offers a good prognosis; hence, late effects of breast RT becomes increasingly important. Recent literature suggests a potential for an increase in cardiac and pulmonary events after RT. However, these studies have not taken into account the impact of newer and current RT techniques that are now available. Hence, this review aimed to evaluate the clinical evidence for each technique and determine the optimal radiation technique for ESNNBC treatment. Currently, six RT techniques are consistently used and studied: 1) prone positioning, 2) proton beam RT, 3) intensity-modulated RT, 4) breath-hold, 5) partial breast irradiation, and 6) intraoperative RT. These techniques show dosimetric promise. However, limited data on late cardiac and pulmonary events exist due to challenges in long-term follow-up. Moving forward, future studies are needed to validate the efficacy and clinical outcomes of these current techniques."

IMRT is ideal for treating complex treatment volumes and avoiding close proximity organs at risk that may be dose limiting and provides increased tumour control through an escalated dose and reduces normal tissue complications through organ at risk sparing. Given the potential advantages of IMRT and the availability of IMRT-enabled treatment planning systems and linear accelerators, IMRT has been introduced in a number of disease sites. This systematic review examined the evidence for IMRT in the treatment of breast cancer to quantify the potential benefits of this new technology and to make recommendations for radiation treatment programmes considering adopting this technique. Providing that avoidance of acute adverse effects associated with radiation is an outcome of interest, then IMRT is recommended over tangential radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, based on a review of six published reports including 2012 patients. There were insufficient data to recommend IMRT over standard tangential radiotherapy for reasons of oncological outcomes or late toxicity. Future research should focus on studies with longer follow-up and provide data on late toxicity and disease recurrence rates."

Of those, 1,475 were excluded based on abstract review. Full texts of 24 remaining articles were reviewed and 11 articles were included in the final analysis. Side effects were analysed as the primary outcomes of interest. We calculated individual odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for 17 classifications of side effects reported. The data for eight classifications of side effects were then pooled for meta-analyses to obtain more precise estimates of the relationships between adjuvant RT and a particular side effect. RESULTS: The pooled analyses revealed potential protective associations between adjuvant IMRT and two acute side effects: dermatitis and moist desquamation. The remaining pooled estimates suggest that the odds of developing edema, hyperpigmentation, fat necrosis, pain, induration were no worse, nor better among those treated with IMRT compared with those treated with non-IMRT standard wedge RT. CONCLUSION: The pooled estimates from this meta-analysis are in line with the existing evidence. When the outcome of interest is reduction of the acute side effects: dermatitis and moist desquamation IMRT is a viable treatment option for women undergoing external beam RT after breast-conserving surgery."

METHODS: Prospective randomized trials comparing adjuvant PBI to WBI in early-stage invasive breast cancer were identified using PubMed. Odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals and absolute risks were computed for pre-specified efficacy and toxicity outcomes including cosmesis. Subgroup analysis evaluated the effect of PBI modality (external beam radiation treatment [EBRT], intraoperative radiation treatment [IORT] or brachytherapy) on efficacy. Meta-regression analysis explored the influence of median follow-up, patient and tumor characteristics on results. RESULTS: Nine trials comprising 14514 patients were included. While PBI was associated with increased odds of local recurrence compared to WBI (OR 1.69, P < 0.001), it was associated with reduced odds of death without breast cancer recurrence (OR 0.55, P < 0.001) and with improvement in overall survival (OS) that approached, but did not meet statistical significance (OR 0.84, P = 0.06). Subgroup analysis for PBI modality showed significant differences in the odds of local recurrence, based on method of PBI with EBRT showing the lowest magnitude of inferiority. Nodal involvement was associated with higher local recurrence risk, while larger tumors were associated with lesser improvement in death without breast cancer recurrence and OS. PBI was associated with higher odds of fat necrosis (OR 1.72, P = 0.002). Worse cosmetic outcome with PBI approached statistical significance (OR 1.23, P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to WBI, PBI is associated with higher odds for local recurrence and toxicity, but less death without breast cancer recurrence. The balance between benefit and risk of PBI appears optimal for women with smaller hormone receptor positive tumors, without nodal involvement and treated with EBRT."

Background: Numerous (APBI) techniques are available for clinical practice. Methods and materials: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials of APBI versus whole breast irradiation (WBI). The data from APBI studies were extracted for the analyses. Indirect comparisons were used to compare different APBI techniques. Results: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 4343 patients were included, most of them with tumor stage T1-T2 and N0. Regarding APBI techniques, six trials used external beam radiation therapy; one intraoperative electrons; one intraoperative low-energy photons; one brachytherapy; and one external beam radiation therapy or brachytherapy. The indirect comparisons related to 5-years local control and 5-years overall survival were not significantly different between APBI techniques. Conclusions: Based on indirect comparisons, no differences in clinical outcomes were observed among diverse APBI techniques in published clinical trials that formally compared WBI to APBI. However wide confidence intervals and high risk of inconsistency precluded a sound conclusion. Further head-to-head clinical trials comparing different APBI techniques are required to confirm our findings.

The rationale of this strategy is that most local recurrences appear close to the tumorectomy cavity and a wish to spare the patient late radiation morbidity. This review discusses the background for APBI, the different techniques, and we highlight possible pitfalls using these techniques. A systematic overview of all phase I and II studies is provided. Patient selection for this therapy is pivotal and based on evidence from previous studies on patient/tumour characteristics and pattern of local recurrences we propose inclusion criteria for patients in APBI protocols."

Breast-conserving therapy, which involved lumpectomy followed by adjuvant irradiation, is now widely considered the standard of care in women with early-stage breast cancer. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), which involves focal irradiation of the lumpectomy cavity over a short period of time, has developed over the past two decades as an alternative to whole breast irradiation (WBI). Multiple APBI modalities have been developed including brachytherapy, external beam irradiation, and intraoperative irradiation. These new techniques have provided early-stage breast cancer patients with shorter treatment duration and more focused irradiation, delivering very high biological doses to the region at a high risk of failures over a much shorter treatment course as compared with conventional radiotherapy. However, the advantages of APBI over conventional radiotherapy are controversial, including a higher risk of complications reported in retrospective literature and shorter follow-up duration in the intraoperative APBI trials. Nevertheless, APBI presents a valuable alternative to WBI for a selected population of women with early-stage breast cancer."

Accelerated partial-breast irradiation and hypofractionated whole-breast radiotherapy are treatment approaches that promise both reduced overall treatment times and the potential for increased use of breast-conservation therapy. IMRT offers unparalleled dose homogeneity and conformality that enables dose reduction to normal structures with the potential to reduce treatment toxicity and improve cosmesis.

It has now become the standard part of the breast-conserving procedure, as well as in patients who underwent mastectomy with T3+tumor and/or 4 or more positive lymphnodes in axilla. METHODS: Improvements are seen in the postmastectomy radiotherapy area by delivering better treatment techniques herewith avoiding treatment of the heart and lungs in order to optimize the improvement of local control and the significant improvement in survival. Indications exist that the largest impact of postmastectomy radiotherapy on survival is mostly seen in patients with minimal tumorload, i.e. small tumors and/or 1 or 2 positive lymphnodes. RESULTS: In several clinical trials, it was shown that the relapse rate in the ipsilateral breast is reduced with a HR of 4 if whole breast irradiation is given after tumorectomy. The update of the Oxford meta-analysis demonstrated that this improvement in local control has also led to an improved survival in these patients. More information is recently gained on the required radiation dose in breast-conserving therapy. Especially patients less than 50 years of age have to be treated with a high radiation dose, 50 + 16 Gy boost, while a dose of 50 Gy in 5 weeks seems sufficient for patients older than 50 years, who have a microscopically complete excision. Further optimization of the radiotherapy technique is found in imaged guided approaches and intensity modulated radiotherapy. Combining these efforts allows for a more precise delivery of the radiation dose to a limited volume, so that the side effects like fibrosis will be reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Partial breast irradiation, instead of whole breast irradiation, is now being tested in a few randomized trials. Although this approach may be useful in certain patients groups, it still cannot be accepted as standard treatment, as no proper selection criteria exist and no long-term follow-up data have been presented."

WBI requires a treatment course of several weeks, which has resulted in limited access to breast-conserving therapy in certain populations. A shorter accelerated course of partial breast irradiation (APBI) has been investigated recently. METHODS: This article reviews the current medical literature, including randomized trials and prospective institutional studies of APBI and the current recommendations regarding the use of this emerging technique. RESULTS: Several APBI techniques have been developed, including brachytherapy and external beam methods. The longest follow-up data are available for multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, a technique that is not commonly used. Other methods, including balloon brachytherapy and external beam three-dimensional conformal techniques, have limited follow-up that shows similar local control rates to whole breast irradiation in highly selected patients. Guidelines for the appropriate use of APBI have been published. CONCLUSIONS: While APBI may increase access to breast conservation therapy for some women with early-stage breast cancer, follow-up data demonstrating the efficacy of this relatively new treatment approach are limited. Therefore, strict evidence-based selection criteria should be applied when evaluating patients who may be appropriate for APBI."

Two such schedules that are frequently compared are hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy (HERT) and accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Though these two modalities are considered separately, APBI is an actually an advanced form of hypofractionation, where acceleration of the treatment is possible due to the smaller volume being irradiated. HERT as well as APBI are investigational at present and are being tested in randomized trials. This article looks at the advantages of APBI as a hypofractionation schedule."

Postoperative RT is a standard adjuvant treatment in conservative treatment of breast cancer (BC). The aim of this review is to analyze available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on IMRT in BC, particularly in terms of reduction of side effects. METHODS: A literature search of the bibliographic database PubMed, from January 1990 through November 2016, was performed. Only RCTs published in English were included. RESULTS: Ten articles reporting data from 5 RCTs fulfilled the selection criteria and were included in our review. Three out of 5 studies enrolled only selected patients in terms of increased risk of toxicity. Three studies compared IMRT with standard tangential RT. One study compared the results of IMRT in the supine versus the prone position, and one study compared standard treatment with accelerated partial breast IMRT. Three studies reported reduced acute and/or late toxicity using IMRT compared with standard RT. No study reported improved quality of life. CONCLUSION: IMRT seems able to reduce toxicity in selected patients treated with postoperative RT for BC. Further analyses are needed to better define patients who are candidates for this treatment modality."

Surgical principles have shifted away from the Halstedian concept of radical surgery towards more cosmetic breast-conserving procedures, and advances have been made in terms of oncologic and plastic surgical techniques for those opting for mastectomy and reconstruction. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has revolutionized the evaluation of patients' nodal status and has become widely accepted as state of the art."" Medical oncology has made tremendous advances and is no longer relegated to the patients with metastatic disease. It is well accepted that chemotherapy may play a role even in patients with small tumors. Certainly the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for downsizing tumors and making them amenable for breast conservation is also widely accepted. The advent of anthracyclines and, more recently, taxane-based regimens has had a substantial impact on the management of breast cancer. In addition, newer hormonal therapies such as the aromatase inhibitors have rivaled the classic cornerstone of tamoxifen. Radiation therapy has evolved from the era of cobalt-based therapy to newer, less morbid, techniques. In addition to advances in external beam radiation, the concept of accelerated partial breast irradiation and intraoperative radiation therapy is evolving and continues to be the focus of research endeavors. The unparalleled advances in the management of breast cancer in the fields of surgical, medical, and radiation oncology over the last half century continue today with ongoing research and clinical trials. As we enter the new millennium, breast cancer management will continue to evolve."""

Currently, the challenge is to optimise the therapeutic ratio by minimising treatment-related morbidity, while maintaining or improving local control and survival. The second part of this review examines the role of two approaches: intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and partial breast irradiation, as means of improving the therapeutic ratio. Discussion of IMRT includes both inverse- and forward-planned methods: the breast usually requires minimal modulation to improve dose homogeneity, and therefore lends itself to simpler forward-planned IMRT techniques; whereas inverse-planned IMRT may be useful in selected cases. There are many dosimetry studies reporting the superiority of IMRT over conventional breast radiotherapy, but there is still a paucity of clinical data regarding patient benefit from these techniques. A critical literature review of clinical partial breast radiotherapy studies focuses on the influence of irradiated breast volume, dose and fractionation, and patient selection on normal tissue side-effects and local control. Clinical reports of partial breast irradiation show several encouraging, but some concerning results about local recurrence rates. Therefore, mature results from randomised trials comparing partial breast irradiation with whole-breast radiotherapy are required. Accurate localisation of the tumour bed and application of appropriate clinical target volumes and planning target volumes are discussed in detail, as these concepts are fundamental for partial breast irradiation."

This approach involves local excision of the malignancy with tumor-free margins, followed by 5-7 weeks of external beam whole breast (WB) radiotherapy (XRT) to minimize the risk of an in-breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Though clearly beneficial, the extended course of almost daily postoperative radiotherapy interrupts normal activities and lengthens care. Additional options are now available that shorten the radiotherapy treatment time to 1-5 days (accelerated) and focus an increased dose of radiation on just the breast tissue around the excision cavity (partial breast). Recent trials with accelerated, partial breast irradiation (APBI) have shown promise as a potential replacement to the longer, whole breast treatments for select women with early-stage breast cancer. Current APBI approaches include interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary (balloon) brachytherapy, and accelerated external beam (3-D conformal) radiotherapy, all of which normally complete treatment over 5 days, while intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) condenses the entire treatment into a single dose delivered immediately after tumor excision. Each approach has benefits and limitations. This study covers over 2 decades of clinical trials exploring APBI, discusses treatment variables that appear necessary for successful implementation of this new form of radiotherapy, compares and contrasts the various APBI approaches, and summarizes current and planned randomized trials that will shape if and how APBI is introduced into routine clinical care. Some of the more important outcome variables from these trials will be local toxicity, local and regional recurrence, and overall survival. If APBI options are ultimately demonstrated to be as safe and effective as current whole breast radiotherapy approaches, breast conservation may become an even more appealing choice, and the overall impact of treatment may be further reduced for certain women with newly diagnosed breast cancer."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Heart-sparing can be performed in three different ways in breast cancer radiotherapy: by seeking to keep the heart out of treated volumes (i.e. by prone position or specific breathing techniques such as deep inspiration breath-hold [DIBH] and/or gating), by solely irradiating a small volume around the lumpectomy cavity (partial breast irradiation, PBI), or by using modern radiation techniques like intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or protons. This overview presents the available data on these three approaches. RESULTS: Studies on prone position are heterogeneous and most trials only refer to patients with large breasts; therefore, no definitive conclusion can be drawn for clinical routine. Nonetheless, there seems to be a trend toward better sparing of the left anterior descending artery in supine position even for these selected patients. The data on the use of DIBH for heart-sparing in breast cancer patients is consistent and the benefit compared to free-breathing is supported by several studies. In comparison with whole breast irradiation (WBI), PBI has an advantage in reducing the heart dose. Of note, DIBH and PBI with multicatheter brachytherapy are similar with regard to the dose reduction to heart structures. WBI by IMRT/VMAT techniques without DIBH is not an effective strategy for heart-sparing in breast cancer patients with standard"" anatomy. A combination of DIBH and IMRT may be used for internal mammary radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Based on the available findings, the DEGRO breast cancer expert panel recommends the use of DIBH as the best heart-sparing technique. Nonetheless, depending on the treatment volume and localization, other techniques may be employed or combined with DIBH when appropriate."""

This survey aimed to determine current breast radiotherapy practices across Australia. METHOD: An online survey was completed by 50 of the 69 Australian radiation therapy treatment centres. RESULTS: Supine tangential beam whole breast irradiation remains the standard of care for breast radiotherapy in Australia. A growing number of institutions are exploring prone positioning and IMRT utilisation. This survey demonstrated a wide variation in the benchmarks used to limit and report organ at risk doses, prescribed dose regimen, and post-mastectomy bolus practices. This survey also indicated, when compared with international literature, that there may be less interest in or uptake of external beam partial breast irradiation, prone positioning, simultaneous integrated boost and breath hold techniques. These are areas where further review and research may be warranted to ensure Australian patients are receiving the best care possible based on the best evidence available.

Additionally, IORT and other PBI techniques are likely to be more widely adopted in the future because they improve patient convenience by offering an accelerated course of treatment. Coupled with these novel techniques for breast radiotherapy (RT) are distinct toxicity profiles and unique cosmetic alterations that differ from conventional breast EBRT and have the potential to impact disease surveillance and patient satisfaction.

The alignment of physician practice patterns with best evidence and patient preferences will enhance patient autonomy and improve cancer care. However, there is little information describing patient preferences for breast RT and physician practice patterns. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using a reliable and valid instrument, we assessed the preferences of 5,000 randomly selected women (with or without cancer) undergoing mammography. To assess practice patterns, 2,150 randomly selected physician-members of American Society for Radiation Oncology were surveyed. RESULTS: A total of 1,807 women (36%) and 363 physicians (17%) provided usable responses. The 95% confidence interval is < +/- 2.3% for patients and < +/- 5.3% for physicians. Patient preferences were hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) 62%, partial breast irradiation (PBI) 28%, and conventionally fractionated whole breast irradiation (CF-WBI) 10%. By comparison, 82% of physicians use CF-WBI for more than 2/3 of women and 56% never use HF-WBI. With respect to PBI, 62% of women preferred three-dimensional (3D)-PBI and 38% favor brachytherapy-PBI, whereas 36% of physicians offer 3D-PBI and 66% offer brachytherapy-PBI. 70% of women prefer once-daily RT over 10 days vs. twice-daily RT over 5 days. 55% of physicians who use PBI do not offer PBI on clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: HF-WBI, while preferred by patients and supported by evidence, falls behind the unproven and less preferred strategy of PBI in clinical practice. There is a discrepancy between women's preferences for PBI modality and type of PBI offered by physicians. Further alignment is needed between practice patterns, patient preferences, and clinical evidence."

Several choices are currently available to certain patient subsets that allow radiation oncologists to individualize care. Multiple phase II and several phase III trials have been published that support the safety and efficacy of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) as part of breast conservation in selected patients. In contrast, a recent large retrospective analysis of patients aged 67 or older who received brachytherapy for APBI has raised concerns about its effectiveness. As the radiation community awaits results from NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413, the largest randomized trial of whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) versus APBI, to provide more conclusive data, many academic and private radiation oncology practices are utilizing APBI off-protocol to treat early-stage breast cancer patients. Because of this, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) published a consensus statement in 2009 to aid in proper patient selection (Table 1). Until more definitive data is garnered, we advocate strict adherence to these selection criteria to ensure optimal outcomes. Specifically, we caution against the use of APBI in lymph node-positive disease outside of a clinical trial. There is a paucity of comparative data to guide oncologists in selection of the best APBI delivery method. The current NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 trial allows any of the three most common forms of delivery to be utilized (multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, balloon intracavitary brachytherapy, and external beam 3D conformal therapy) and will be instrumental to compare outcome differences between these methods."

The objective of the current study was to critically review the rationale for and the theoretic and actual risks and benefits of repeat breast-conserving surgery followed by partial breast irradiation (PBI) for in-breast local recurrence of breast carcinoma. The main outcomes of interest were local control and survival after in-breast local recurrence and side effects, complications, and cosmesis after reirradiation of the breast. The risk of local recurrence was not found to be eliminated with mastectomy; approximately 2-32% of patients treated with mastectomy develop a chest wall recurrence. The interpretation of local control rates in evaluating repeat breast-conserving surgery studies is difficult because of the lack of information regarding preoperative diagnostic mammography to rule out concurrent multicentric disease and microscopic margin status after surgery. Rates of subsequent local recurrence in these studies appeared to be between 19-50%, similar to reported rates of in-breast local recurrence in patients with a first diagnosis of breast carcinoma who were treated with conservative surgery without irradiation. Early follow-up studies of breast reirradiation suggest that catheter-based interstitial brachytherapy and standard external beam radiation therapy can be delivered to the breast more than once without significant side effects in most patients and with acceptable cosmesis in some patients. Mastectomy may not be necessary in all patients with an in-breast local recurrence of breast carcinoma. Recent advances in conformal radiation delivery and single-center published reports concerning repeat breast-conserving therapy support well designed prospective trials to formally test this hypothesis."

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Because of rapid evolution of radiation therapy techniques related to brachytherapy and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, APBI has very recently come to the forefront as a potential local treatment option for women with breast cancer. This review aims to give an overview of the biologic rationale for APBI techniques, and benefits and limitations of APBI techniques. METHODS: The authors reviewed the currently available published world medical literature on breast-conserving surgery with and without postoperative irradiation; all studies involving partial breast irradiation, including brachytherapy, for breast cancer; and currently accruing and planned APBI trials. The focus of this review was the early results of treatment in terms of toxicity, complications, cosmesis, and local control. RESULTS: On average, approximately 3% of patients treated with breast-conserving surgery will have an in-breast local recurrence away from the original lumpectomy site with or without postoperative standard whole-breast irradiation. The results of phase I-II studies involving approximately 500 patients treated with APBI after breast-conserving surgery have been published. Although many of the studies have limited long-term follow-up and potential selection bias, early results suggest that toxicity, cosmesis, and local control are comparable to outcomes seen after breast-conserving surgery followed by standard whole-breast irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Recent advances in radiation delivery and published series of partial breast irradiation support large randomized trials comparing APBI with standard whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery."

The EBCTCG specifically found that the absolute reduction in the 5-year rate of LR was proportional to the absolute reduction in 15-year breast cancer mortality with a 4:1 ratio. Studies from the EBCTCG have also clearly shown that when RT for breast cancer inadvertently delivers 'excessive' dose to the heart, there is an increased rate of late cardiac deaths. Over time, LR rates with RT have decreased, particularly after BCS, and this is largely due to a favorable interaction of RT with adjuvant systemic therapy. There is new information emerging about the effectiveness of RT based on newer biologic classification of breast cancer and about how the 4:1 ratio might change in the face of increasingly effective systemic therapy and with a better understanding of the importance of biologic classification and of the competing risks of local and distant recurrence. Technical innovations in RT include the development of techniques that minimize cardiac irradiation. It is critical that CT simulation be done during which the heart should be contoured and the radiation dose-cardiac volume relationship be determined. In the EBCTCG's preliminary analysis, increased late cardiac deaths were most closely linked to mean cardiac doses >5 Gy. A number of techniques are available to minimize cardiac dose both after BCS and mastectomy and these will be described. There has also been development of fractionation and treatment techniques to complete RT faster for purposes of patient convenience and to assure its optimal level of use. There are now 10-year results from a Canadian trial showing equivalent LR and cosmetic outcome with RT using the conventional 25 treatments to the whole breast compared to 16 treatments using a higher dose per day. Few randomized patients, however, were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and a boost was not used. The generalizability of the Canadian trial results to patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or requiring a boost is not known. For patients treated after BCS, there has been great interest in the use of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), which can be accomplished using interstitial, intracavitary, external-beam or intraoperative techniques. Clinical trials are now underway to compare APBI to conventional techniques, but mature results from these trials will not be available for some time. In the U.S., ASTRO has developed a consensus statement based on an expert panel as to when APBI can be reasonably used outside of a clinical trial and this will be described."

This has led investigators to evaluate an alternative approach of delivering radiation to a limited volume of tissue around the tumour cavity only (partial breast irradiation) and delivering a larger than standard dose of radiation with each treatment (accelerated partial breast irradiation, APBI). This approach may be achieved by a number of techniques: interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy using the Mammosite device, intraoperative techniques using electrons or low-energy photons, external beam radiotherapy or permanent seed implant.

Precise identification of target volumes, better coverage and dose homogeneity have had a positive impact on toxicity and local control. The conformity of treatment dose due to three-dimensional radiotherapy and new techniques such as intensity modulated radiotherapy makes it possible to spare surrounding normal tissue. The widespread use of dose-volume constraints and histograms have increased awareness of toxicity. Real time image guidance has improved geometric precision and accuracy, together with the implementation of quality assurance programs. Advances in the precision of radiotherapy is also based on the choice of the appropriate fractionation and approach. Adaptive radiotherapy is not only a technical concept, but is also a biological concept based on the knowledge that different types of BC have distinctive patterns of locoregional spread. A greater understanding of cancer biology helps in choosing the treatment best suited to a particular situation. Biomarkers predictive of response play a crucial role. The combination of radiotherapy with molecular targeted therapies may enhance radiosensitivity, thus increasing the cytotoxic effects and improving treatment response. The appropriateness of an alternative fractionation, partial breast irradiation, dose escalating/de-escalating approaches, the extent of nodal irradiation have been examined for all the BC subtypes. The broadened concept of adaptive radiotherapy is vital to high-precision treatments."

RECENT FINDINGS: The role of radiation therapy in the management of breast cancer has not changed in recent decades, however methods of treatment delivery have advanced considerably. Hypofractionation and accelerated partial breast irradiation, which substantially reduce radiation treatment duration, have emerged as appropriate alternatives to conventional whole breast radiation in select patient subsets, and intensity modulated radiation therapy, breathing-adapted radiation therapy, and prone-positioning technique address challenging anatomic issues and reduce treatment-associated toxicity. Stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy continue to advance the management of distant metastatic disease. SUMMARY: Radiation therapy plays a significant role in the management of early stage, locoregionally advanced, and metastatic breast cancer. Technological advances are allowing for greater patient convenience and comfort in locoregional radiation therapy delivery and for expanded radiation therapy indications in the setting of metastatic disease."

In APBI, the tumor bed is topically irradiated over a short period after breast-conserving surgery. The fundamental concept underlying APBI is that more than 70% of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence occurs in the neighborhood of the original tumor, and that hypofractionated radiotherapy can be applied safely when the irradiated volume is small enough. It is expected to reduce the time and cost required for conventional whole breast irradiation while maintaining equivalent local control. Several techniques including multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy, intraoperative radiation therapy, and 3D conformal external beam radiation therapy have been proposed, and each of them has its own advantages and drawbacks. Although APBI is increasingly used in the United States and Europe, and the short-term results are promising, its equivalence with whole breast radiation therapy is not fully established. In addition, because the average breast size in Japan is considerably smaller than in the West world, the application of APBI to Japanese patients is technically more challenging. At this point, APBI is still an investigational treatment in Japan, and the optimal method of radiation delivery as well as its long-term efficacy and safety should be clarified in clinical trials."

However, many women are still treated with mastectomy, due to logistical issues related to the long course of radiotherapy (RT). To reduce mastectomy rates and/or omission of RT after breast-conserving surgery, shorter, hypofractionated RT treatments have been introduced. More recently, the necessity of routinely treating the entire breast in all patients has been questioned, leading to the development of partial breast radiotherapy. With accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) these two approaches have been combined: the tumor bed with a 1-2 cm margin is irradiated either intra-operatively (single fraction) or postoperatively over 5-15 days. Different techniques have been developed, including interstitial brachytherapy, intra-cavity brachytherapy, intra-operative radiotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. These techniques are being evaluated in several ongoing phase III studies. Since its introduction, APBI has been the subject of continuous debate. ASTRO and GEC-ESTRO have published guidelines for patient selection for APBI, and strongly recommend that APBI be carried out within ongoing clinical trials. Recently, the patient selection criteria for APBI have also been up for debate, following the publication of results from different groups that do/do not confirm a difference in recurrence risk among the ASTRO defined risk groups. This paper reviews the different APBI techniques, current recommendations for patient selection, available clinical data and ongoing clinical trials. A case report is included to illustrate the need for careful follow-up of patients treated with APBI."

Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) and accelerated whole-breast irradiation (AWBI) have been developed as alternatives to conventional WBI for selected patients with early-stage breast cancer. Given its large size and long follow-up, the Canadian trial of AWBI has been widely considered as practice-changing, and additional studies of AWBI are maturing or newly-launched. Use of APBI is based on the observation that the majority of local recurrences occur near the primary tumor site. Because a smaller portion of the breast is irradiated, treatment courses can often be abbreviated, and techniques such as conformal external beam, catheter- or balloon-based brachytherapy, and intra-operative radiation have been developed. Data from early APBI randomized trials and retrospective studies report mixed results.

However, due to geographic limitations, patient preferences, and financial considerations, there have been continued attempts to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abbreviated or hypofractionated courses of whole-breast radiation. Two key factors in these attempts have been: 1) advances in radiobiology allowing for a more precise estimation of equivalent dosing, and 2) advances in the delivery of RT ('modulation') that have resulted in substantially improved dose homogeneity in the target volume. Hypofractionated schedules have been compared to conventional radiation courses in several randomized controlled trials, as well as many prospective and retrospective experiences. These studies, now with about 10 years of follow-up, have demonstrated equivalent rates of local-regional recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival. The rates of toxicity have generally not been increased with hypofractionated regimens; however, certain toxicities may take decades to manifest. The generalizability of these results is unclear, as the majority of patients in the trials were elderly with early-stage hormone-receptor positive disease. Nevertheless, there is now sufficient evidence to recommend hypofractionated whole breast RT for a substantial percentage of patients."

Long-term follow-up has demonstrated equivalent survival to mastectomy. However, standard WBRT to the conserved breast requires daily radiation treatment, 5 days per week, for 5-7 weeks. This schedule imposes a considerable burden on breast cancer patients and healthcare systems alike. For the last decade, there has been considerable interest in lessening the volume of breast treated with radiotherapy and reducing the number of fractions of radiation treatment. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), including intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), delivers high-dose radiation immediately surrounding the lumpectomy cavity, with relative sparing of the majority of the ipsilateral breast. Hypofractionated WBRT delivers radiation to the entire ipsilateral breast; however, this is achieved using a smaller number of fractions and total dose of radiotherapy. The attraction of less invasive or demanding radiotherapy schedules has led to the widespread introduction of APBI before its long-term results have been established. In the past 5 years, data from prospective trials of hypofractionated WBRT and IORT compared to standard WBRT have become available. Additionally, a large, prospective randomized study of APBI versus WBRT is nearing accrual. In this review article, we will discuss these new innovative techniques in radiotherapy for breast cancer. We will also discuss the recently completed and ongoing prospective studies that will provide a robust evaluation of the safety and efficacy of these techniques."

When used in carefully selected patients, APBI also allows normal portions of the breast parenchyma and regional vital organs to be spared from unnecessary irradiation. Common post-APBI imaging findings include focal skin thickening, seroma, scar, and skin retraction. Studies are underway that will compare a cohort of patients who underwent whole-breast irradiation with a cohort who underwent APBI to help determine whether the two techniques lead to significantly different imaging findings. Additional multicenter studies will be needed to document and analyze any such differences. In the future, APBI may play a significant role in selected patients, with pretherapy dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the breast possibly aiding in the selection process."

The majority of local recurrences occur in close proximity to the tumor bed. Thus, the necessity of whole breast radiotherapy has been questioned, and several centers have evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of sole tumor bed irradiation. The aim of this study was to review the current status, controversies, and future prospects of tumor bed irradiation alone after breast conserving surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Published prospective trials evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of radiotherapy confined to the tumor bed following breast conserving surgery were reviewed in order to analyze treatment results. RESULTS: In three earlier studies, using tumor bed radiotherapy for unselected patients, the incidence of intra-breast relapse was reported in the range of 15.6-37%. However, in nine prospective phase I-II trials, sole brachytherapy (BT) with different dose rates, strict patient selection, and meticulous quality assurance, resulted in 95.6-100% local control rates. To date, only one phase III protocol has been initiated comparing the efficacy of tumor bed brachytherapy alone with conventional whole breast radiotherapy. The ideal extend of the planning target volume (PTV) for tumor bed radiotherapy alone has not been established yet. In most series, PTV was defined as the excision cavity with generous (1-3 cm) safety margins. Minimal requirement for PTV localization is the use of titanium clips to mark the walls of the excision cavity intraoperatively, but the combination of clip demarcation and three-dimensional (3-D) visual information obtained from cross-sectional images seems to be the best method to determine the target volume. 3-D virtual brachytherapy is also a promising method to minimize the chance of geographic miss. Recently developed techniques, such as intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), as well as accelerated 3-D conformal external beam radiation therapy (3-D-CRT) were also found to be feasible for tumor bed radiotherapy alone. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the existing arguments against limiting radiotherapy to the tumor bed after breast conserving surgery, results of phase I-II studies suggest that tumor bed radiotherapy alone might be an appropriate treatment option for selected breast cancer patients. Whole breast radiotherapy remains the standard radiation modality used in the treatment of breast cancer, and brachytherapy as the sole modality should be considered as investigational. Further phase-III trials are suggested to determine the equivalence of sole tumor bed radiotherapy, compared with whole breast radiotherapy. Preliminary results with recently developed techniques (CT-image based conformal brachytherapy, 3-D virtual brachytherapy, IORT, 3-D-CRT) are promising. However, more experience is required to define whether these methods might improve outcome for patients treated with tumor bed radiotherapy alone."

Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) involves treating a limited volume of breast tissue, with dose of irradiation per fraction increased and the treatment time course decreased. Four currently available methods of APBI are interstitial brachytherapy, intracavitary brachytherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external-beam radiotherapy. Patient selection is critical.

Observations that 80-90% of breast recurrences after breast conservative surgery and WBI occur in the tumor bed questions the need for protracted elective WBI, and provides the rationale for accelerated-partial-breast irradiation (APBI) of small cancers without adverse features predisposing to multicentric recurrence. APBI can be given over a week with various external beam, intraoperative or brachytherapy (interstitial or MammoSite) techniques. Since the approval of MammoSite by the US FDA in May 2002, a surge of interest has been evident, with 4,000 cases treated using this technique in the past 2 years. Several phase II APBI brachytherapy studies show that 4 to 7-year breast control rates (95%), survival and cosmetic outcome obtained from more than 600 appropriately selected women are comparable to matched or historic controls receiving WBI. The 2 to 3-year interim results of two ongoing randomized trials do not show any early detriment with APBI. If mature results of randomized trials confirm equivalence of APBI to conventional WBI in selected women, it would mark a paradigm shift and a major advance in treatment. This would allow many more women to opt for breast conservation, resolve the dilemmas regarding chemotherapy and radiotherapy sequencing and perhaps would be more cost effective."

Whereas the indications for systemic adjuvant treatment have continuously expanded, there is a tendency to restrict postoperative radiotherapy to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) instead of WBRT. METHODS: The different techniques of APBI are described and their respective advantages or potential drawbacks outlined. Moreover, the results described in the literature are briefly reviewed as a basis for the consensus statements and recommendations of the German Society of Radiation Oncology, the German Society of Senology, and the Working Group for Gynecological Oncology of the German Cancer Society. RESULTS: The methods mainly used for APBI are: interstitial radiotherapy with multicatheter technique, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) using either electrons produced by linear accelerators or 50 kV x-rays (Intrabeam), the balloon-catheter technique (MammoSite), or 3D conformal external beam radiotherapy. These techniques have marked differences in dose distribution and homogeneity. The published range of local recurrence rates varies between 0% to 37%, the median follow-up from 8 to 72 months. CONCLUSIONS: To date, follow-up times mostly do not yet permit a definite judgment concerning the long-term effectiveness and side effects of APBI. The relevant societies in Germany support randomized clinical studies comparing APBI with WBRT in a well-defined subset of low-risk patients. However, the authors expressly discourage the routine use of APBI outside clinical trials. Until definite results show that APBI neither impairs therapeutic outcome nor cosmetic results, WBRT remains the gold standard in the treatment of early breast cancer."

Therefore, the purpose of this APBI guideline is to provide updated data for clinicians as well as recommendations regarding appropriate patient selection and techniques to deliver APBI. METHODS: Members of the American Brachytherapy Society with expertise in breast cancer and breast brachytherapy in particular created an updated guideline for appropriate patient selection based on an extensive literature search and clinical experience. In addition, data were evaluated with respect to APBI techniques and recommendations presented. RESULTS: Appropriate candidates for APBI include patients aged 45 years or older, all invasive histologies and ductal carcinoma in situ, tumors 3 cm or less, node negative, estrogen receptor positive/negative, no lymphovascular space invasion, and negative margins. With respect to techniques, the strongest evidence is for interstitial brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy APBI with moderate evidence to support applicator brachytherapy or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy APBI. Intraoperative radiation therapy and electronic brachytherapy should not be offered regardless of technique outside of clinical trial.

Technological advances in various APBI modalities, including intracavitary and interstitial brachytherapy, intraoperative radiation therapy, and external beam radiation therapy, have made APBI more accessible in the community. Results of early APBI trials served as the basis for the current consensus guidelines, and multiple prospective randomized clinical trials are currently ongoing. The pending long term results of these trials will help us identify optimal candidates that can benefit from ABPI. Here we provide an overview of the clinical and cosmetic outcomes of various APBI techniques and review the current guidelines for selecting suitable breast cancer patients. We also discuss the impact of APBI on the economics of cancer care and patient reported quality of life."

Two important contributions are the use of whole-breast hypofractionation and accelerated partial-breast irradiation. Three large randomized trials comparing whole-breast hypofractionation versus conventional fractionation for early breast cancer have shown similar rates of local recurrence and morbidity. As a result, whole-breast hypofractionation is now an option for selected patients after breast-conserving surgery. The delivery of accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) has been studied using techniques of multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, balloon-based brachytherapy, external-beam radiotherapy, and intraoperative radiotherapy. Multiple single and multi-institutional data have been published indicating good long-term results with APBI (in highly selected, low-risk patients) in terms of tumor control and toxicity. However, the long-term results of large, phase III trials comparing APBI with whole-breast irradiation are still pending."

These include accelerated partial breast irradiation, intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Follow-up data of multicatheter brachytherapy accelerated partial breast irradiation and intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy confirm excellent 5-year local control rates in well selected patients. Early side effects seem to be improved, but recent data show increasing skin toxicity in multicatheter and intracavitary balloon brachytherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy, proton beam partial breast irradiation, intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy improve dose homogeneity and decrease normal tissue complication probability. For breast-only treatment, two tangential fields with different segments provide an attractive and feasible alternative to the conventional technique. The proposed intensity modulated radiotherapy techniques for comprehensive locoregional radiotherapy, however, result in increased doses to the contralateral lung and breast. SUMMARY: Input from long-term clinical data on new radiotherapy techniques is needed. Consensus on target volume contouring and dose volume constraints for nontarget tissue has not yet been reached. Further research on skin toxicity with multicatheter or intracavitary brachytherapy is needed to improve the results."

There are several technical approaches that are clinically established, e.g. brachytherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), or external-beam radiotherapy. The understanding of the underlying biology, optimal technical procedures, patient selection criteria, and imaging changes during follow-up has increased enormously. After completion of several phase III trials using brachytherapy or IORT, APBI is currently increasingly used either in phase IV studies, registries, or in selected patients outside of clinical studies. Consensus statements about suitable patients are available from several international and national societies like ASTRO, ESTRO, and DEGRO. One may expect that 15-25% of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery may qualify for APBI, i.e. patients with small invasive ductal breast cancer without clinical lymph node involvement."

Analyses demonstrate that the quality of radiation dose distribution does affect clinical results, and that outcomes are enhanced through improved planning and dose delivery methods. To achieve these results, it is essential to carefully define tissue volumes for treatment or avoidance, select technologies that can potentially conform fields to those volumes, use comprehensive planning methods, and assess their results in terms of objective dose constraints. IMRT can also be used to boost the region of tumor excision concurrently with whole breast treatment, an approach now being evaluated in on-going clinical studies. Partial breast irradiation (PBI) has been proposed as an alternative to irradiation of the entire breast for early-stage breast cancer patients undergoing breast conservation treatment. Numerous single institution phase II studies have demonstrated promising results, and the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) has defined a suitable group of low-risk patients for PBI treatment off protocol at this time. IMRT has been proposed as an alternative to 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for external beam PBI to improve the dose conformality to target volumes and the sparing of normal tissues. There are an increasing number of institutions evaluating and using IMRT instead of 3DCRT for PBI because of the potential treatment advantages for the breast cancer patient."

APBI delivers higher doses of radiation in fewer fractions to the post-lumpectomy tumor bed with a 1-2 cm margin, targeting the area at the highest risk of local recurrence while sparing normal breast tissue. However, there are inherent challenges in defining accurate target volumes for APBI. Studies have shown that significant interobserver variation exists among radiation oncologists defining the lumpectomy cavity, which raises the question of how to improve the accuracy and consistency in the delineation of tumor bed volumes. The combination of standardized guidelines and surgical clips significantly improves an observer's ability in delineation, and it is the standard in multiple ongoing external-beam APBI trials. However, questions about the accuracy of the clips to mark the lumpectomy cavity remain, as clips only define a few points at the margin of the cavity. This paper reviews the techniques that have been developed so far to improve target delineation in APBI delivered by conformal external beam radiation therapy, including the use of standardized guidelines, surgical clips or fiducial markers, pre-operative computed tomography imaging, and additional imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Alternatives to post-operative APBI, future directions, and clinical recommendations were also discussed."

Long-term clinical trial evidence is unavailable for accelerated modalities, but uncertainty might be acceptable for patients likely to receive suboptimal whole breast RT. The objective of this study is to assess the cost effectiveness of accelerated partial breast RT compared to on-time and delayed whole breast RT. The design used in this study is decision analytic Markov model. The data sources are published literature; and national/federal sources. The target population of this study is a hypothetical cohort of 60 years old women previously treated with breast-conserving surgery for node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with tumors <1 cm. The time horizon is 15 years, and the perspective is societal. The interventions are whole breast RT, 3-D CRT, and brachytherapy breast irradiation. The outcome measures are costs (2008 US$), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The base-case results were: 3-D CRT was the preferred strategy, costing on average $10,800 and yielding 11.21 QALYs. On-time whole breast RT costs $368,000/QALY compared to 3-D CRT, above the $100,000/QALY WTP threshold. 3-D CRT was also preferred over delayed whole breast RT. Brachytherapy was never preferred. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were sensitive to the rate of recurrence outside the initial tumor quadrant (elsewhere failure"") in one-way analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that results were sensitive to parameter uncertainty, and that the elsewhere-failure rate and treatment preferences may drive results. The limitation of this study is that efficacy estimates are derived from studies that may not fully represent the population modeled. As a conclusion, 3-D CRT was preferred to whole breast RT and for women likely to delay RT, indicating that 3-D CRT could be targeted more efficiently before randomized trial evidence."""

We evaluated a cost-minimization strategy to select among RT options. METHODS: An institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective review identified a sample of 100 women who underwent lumpectomy for invasive or in situ breast cancer during 2009. Post lumpectomy RT options included: no radiation in women >/=70 years [T1N0, estrogen receptor (ER)+] per Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343 (no-RT), accelerated external-beam partial-breast irradiation (APBI), and Canadian fractionation (C-RT), as alternatives to standard whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT). Eligibility for RT regimens was based on published criteria. RT costs were estimated using the 2011 US Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and average Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes billed per regimen at our institution. Costs were modeled in a 1,000-patient theoretical cohort. RESULTS: Median patient age was 56.5 years (range 32-93 years). Tumor histology included invasive ductal cancer (78 %), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (15 %), invasive lobular cancer (6 %), and mixed histology (1 %). Median tumor size was 1 cm (range 0.2-5 cm). Estimated per-patient cost of radiation was US$5,341.81 for APBI, US$9,121.98 for C-RT, and US$13,358.37 for WBRT. When patients received the least expensive radiation regimen for which they were eligible, 14 % received no-RT, 44 % received APBI, 7 % received C-RT, and 35 % defaulted to WBRT. Using a cost-minimization strategy, estimated RT costs were US$7.67 million, versus US$13.36 million had all patients received WBRT, representing cost savings of US$5.69 million per 1,000 patients treated. CONCLUSIONS: A cost-minimization strategy results in a 43 % reduction in estimated radiation costs among women undergoing breast conservation."

The accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) regimens included (7): APBI using 3D-CRT, (8) IMRT, (9) single channel balloon, and (10) multi-channel balloon. Costs incurred by the payer (i.e., direct medical costs) were taken from the 2011 Medicare Fee Schedule. Among all the different regimens examined, Canadian 3D-CRT and APBI 3D-CRT were the least costly whereas WB using IMRT with a B was the most expensive. Both APBI brachytherapy techniques were less costly than conventional WB with a B. In terms of direct medical costs, the technical component accounted for most, if not all, of the disparity among the various treatments. A general trend of decreasing RT costs was observed with further reductions in overall treatment time for WBRT techniques, but not all of the alternative treatment regimens led to similar total cost savings. APBI using brachytherapy techniques was less costly than conventional WBRT with a standard boost."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for this analysis came from 2 phase III trials: the TARGIT (Targeted Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial and the ELIOT (Electron Intraoperative Radiotherapy) trial. Cost analyses included a cost-minimization analysis and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis including a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) analysis. Cost analyses were performed comparing IORT with WBI delivered using 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), APBI 3D-CRT, APBI delivered with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), APBI single-lumen (SL), APBI multilumen (ML), and APBI interstitial (I). RESULTS: Per 1000 patients treated, the cost savings with IORT were $3.6-$4.3 million, $1.6-$2.4 million, $3.6-$4.4 million, $7.5-$8.2 million, and $2.8-$3.6 million compared with WBI 3D-CRT, APBI IMRT, APBI SL, APBI ML, and APBI I, respectively, with a cost decrement of $1.6-$2.4 million compared with APBI 3D-CRT based on data from the TARGIT trial. The costs per QALY for WBI 3D-CRT, APBI IMRT, APBI SL, APBI ML, and APBI I compared with IORT were $47,990-$60,002; $17,335-$29,347; $49,019-$61,031; $108,162-$120,173; and $36,129-$48,141, respectively, based on data from the ELIOT trial. These results are consistent with APBI and WBI being cost-effective compared with IORT. CONCLUSION: Based on cost-minimization analyses, IORT represents a potential cost savings in the management of early-stage breast cancer. However, absolute reimbursement is misleading, because when additional medical and nonmedical costs associated with IORT are factored in, WBI and APBI represent cost-effective modalities based on cost-per-QALY analyses. They remain the standard of care."

Cost analyses included a cost minimization analysis, incremental cost- effectiveness ratio (ICER) analysis, and cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) analysis. Per 1,000 patients treated, the cost savings with the utilization of APBI compared to WBI IMRT is $14.9 million, $10.9 million, $8.8 million, $5.0 million, and $9.7 million for APBI 3D-CRT, APBI IMRT, APBI single-lumen (SL), APBI multi-lumen (ML), and APBI interstitial, respectively.

The cost per QALY for APBI SL, APBI ML, and APBI interstitial compared with APBI 3D-CRT are $12,273, $66,032, and $546, respectively. When incorporating non-medical costs and cost of recurrences the cost per QALY was $54,698 and $49,009 for APBI ML compared with APBI 3D-CRT. When compared to WBI IMRT, all APBI techniques are cost-effective based on cost minimization, ICER, and QALY analyses.

MATERIALS/METHODS: Four hundred fifty-three patients were treated with APBI using either 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT, n=207) or balloon-based brachytherapy (BB) [single-lumen (SL, n=161) and multilumen (ML, n=85)] between March 2000 and October 2011. To evaluate cost-effectiveness, reimbursement by treatment technique was calculated based on 2011 Medicare schedules. Facility costs were generated by technique based on ICD-9 codes. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER), which compares cost with clinical outcomes, were calculated according to the difference in reimbursement to the criteria being evaluated. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 3.6 years, the 5-year rate of local recurrence was 1.9% for all patients (3D-CRT, 0%; BB, 4.1%; P=0.23). When pooled, BB patients had a significant improvement in excellent/good cosmesis (91.6% vs. 80.0%; P=0.03). Rates of combined grade 2 or higher dermatitis, hyper/hypopigmentation, pain, or fibrosis per technique were 62%, 28%, and 34% for 3D-CRT, SL, and ML patients, respectively (P=0.26). The ICER per percent improved cosmesis for SL/ML was $519/$850 based on reimbursement and $301/$643 based on cost compared with 3D-CRT. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of ICER, brachytherapy for APBI is a cost-effective option with regard to cosmesis and toxicity. This economic analysis suggests the increased cost of applicator-based brachytherapy may be justified in appropriately selected patients."

We performed a cost and cost-effectiveness analysis of an external beam image guided APBI technique compared with HWBI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: HWBI was defined as 40 Gy in 15 fractions to the whole breast with or without a 10-Gy/5-fraction boost. APBI was 30 Gy in 5 fractions per Livi et al and was evaluated as both intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy. The decision analytical model measured effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years. Micro-costing was conducted to estimate the true cost of the different treatment regimens, and incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. RESULTS: Based on micro-costing, the cost of HWBI was $4551 with boost and $3666 without boost, compared with $2966 for APBI. Including indirect costs, HWBI with boost cost $6160, HWBI without boost cost $4940, and APBI cost $3569. Cost savings for APBI compared with HWBI with and without boost was $1585 and $700 based on direct costs and $2591 and $1371 including indirect costs. APBI was also more effective, at 0.2300 quality-adjusted life years compared with 0.2289 for HWBI with or without boost. Thus, APBI was both less costly and more effective. Basing cost on Medicare reimbursement (IMRT) leads to APBI again dominating HWBI, but basing cost for APBI on reimbursement billed as stereotactic body radiation therapy leads to HWBI being far more cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Image guided partial breast irradiation is less costly to deliver and has slightly improved efficacy compared with HWBI, with or without a boost. IMRT APBI should be considered a standard-of-care option in appropriately selected patients based on efficacy and value."

Although PBI may lead to greater local recurrence rates, it may be cost-effective because of better tolerability and lower cost. We aim to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of PBI compared with whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT) for estrogen receptor-positive postmenopausal women treated for early-stage breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a Markov model to describe health states in the 15 years after radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. External beam (EB) and MammoSite (MS) PBI were considered and assumed to be equally effective, but carried different costs. Patients received tamoxifen, but not chemotherapy. Utilities, recurrence risks, and costs were adapted from the literature; the baseline utility for no disease after radiotherapy was set at 0.92. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to model uncertainty in the PBI hazard ratio, recurrence pattern, and patient utilities. Costs (in 2004 US dollars) and quality-adjusted life-years were discounted at 3%/y. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for WBRT compared with EB-PBI was $630,000/quality-adjusted life-year; WBRT strongly dominated MS-PBI. One-way sensitivity analysis found that results were sensitive to PBI hazard ratio, recurrence pattern, baseline recurrence risk, and no evidence of disease PBI utility values. Probabilistic sensitivity showed that EB-PBI was the most cost-effective technique over a wide range of assumptions and societal willingness-to-pay values. CONCLUSIONS: EB-PBI was the most cost-effective strategy for postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Unless the quality of life after MS-PBI proves to be superior, it is unlikely to be cost-effective."

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatment planning and delivery utilization data were modeled for eight different breast RT techniques: (1) WBRT-B: 60 Gy in 30 fractions; (2) WBRT: 50 Gy in 25 fractions; (3) WBRT-accelerated (AC): 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions; (4) WBRT-intensity-modulated RT (IMRT): 60 Gy in 30 fractions; (5) accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)-IC, MammoSite: 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions; (6) APBI-IT, HDR interstitial: 34 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions; (7) APBI three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT): 38.5 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions; or (8) APBI-IMRT: 38.5 Gy in 10 twice-daily fractions. Costs incurred by payer (i.e., direct medical costs; 2003 Medicare Fee Schedule) and patient (i.e., direct nonmedical costs; time and travel) were estimated. Total societal costs were then calculated for each treatment approach. RESULTS: Not all efforts to reduce overall treatment time result in total cost savings. The least expensive partial breast-based RT approaches were the external beam techniques (APBI-3D-CRT, APBI-IMRT). Any reduced cost to patients for the HDR brachytherapy-based APBI regimens were overshadowed by substantial increases in cost to payers, resulting in higher total societal costs; the cost of HDR treatment delivery was primarily responsible for the increased direct medical cost. For the whole breast-based RT approaches, treating without a boost (WBRT) or with WBRT-AC reduced total costs. Overall, WBRT-AC was the least costly of all the regimens, in terms of costs to society; APBI approaches, in general, were favored over whole-breast techniques when only considering costs to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on societal cost considerations, WBRT-AC appears to be the preferred approach. If one were to pursue a partial-breast RT regimen to minimize patient costs, it would be more advantageous from a societal perspective to pursue external beam-based approaches such as APBI-3D-CRT or APBI-IMRT in lieu of the brachytherapy-based regimens."

Median patient age was 62 years with the following characteristics: 68% tumor size <1 cm, 72% invasive ductal histology, 77% estrogen receptor (ER) (+), 88% postmenopausal; 88% no chemotherapy and 44% with no hormone therapy. Median follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 1.3-8.3). Four-year estimates of efficacy were IBF: 1.1% (one local recurrence); INF: 0%; CBF: 1.1%; DF: 3.9%; DFS: 95%; OS: 97%; and CSS: 99%. Four (4%) Grade 3 toxicities (one transient breast pain and three fibrosis) were observed. Cosmesis was rated good/excellent in 89% of patients at 4 years. CONCLUSIONS: Four-year efficacy, cosmesis, and toxicity using 3D-CRT to deliver APBI appear comparable to other experiences with similar follow-up. However, additional patients, further follow-up, and mature Phase III data are needed to evaluate thoroughly the extent of application, limitations, and complete value of this particular form of APBI."

Six patients aged 53-69 years with stage T1N0, T2N0, Grade I-II invasive ductal carcinoma received 9-10 Gy prescribed at 1 cm from the MammoSite balloon surface in two fractions of 4.5-5 Gy 6 h apart. The MammoSite was inserted 20-37 days postoperatively. External beam radiation therapy to the whole breast commenced 1-5 days after accelerated partial breast irradiation. The maximum skin dose ranged from 3 to 9 Gy. The skin-cavity distance ranged from 7 to 19 mm. Local discomfort resolved as the scar healed spontaneously within 3-5 days. No Grade III or higher acute toxicity or local infection was recorded. The ease of insertion and accuracy of dosimetry makes the MammoSite suitable for use in properly selected women with early-stage breast cancer in a trial setting."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with early stage breast cancer treated by breast-conserving surgery between 2007 and 2012 were included: 48 women who received three-dimensional conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation in a multicentre phase-II trial were paired with 48 patients prospectively treated with whole breast irradiation. Adverse events, and patients' opinions concerning cosmesis, satisfaction and pain, were gathered 1 month after treatment. Direct and indirect costs were collected from the French National Health Insurance System perspective until the end of radiotherapy. RESULTS: When comparing its impact, skin reactions occurred in 37% of patients receiving three-dimensional conformal accelerated partial breast radiotherapy and 60% of patients receiving whole breast irradiation (P=0.07); 98% were very satisfied in the group three-dimensional conformal accelerated partial breast radiotherapy versus 46% in the group treated with whole breast irradiation (P<0.001); direct costs were significantly lower in the group treated with partial breast irradiation (mean cost: 2510euro versus 5479euro/patient), due to less radiation sessions. CONCLUSION: In patients with early-stage breast cancer, partial irradiation offered a good alternative to whole breast irradiation, as it was less expensive and satisfactory. These, and the clinical safety and tolerance results, need to be confirmed by long-term accelerated partial breast irradiation results in on-going phase III trials."

This is an analysis of patients treated with hypofractionated protocols since 2009, at our tertiary cancer center. METHODS: Details of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant hypofractionated external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) from January 2009 to December 2014 were retrieved and analyzed. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred and eighty patients received adjuvant EBRT during this period. Three hundred and eight were offered hypofractionated schedule. One hundred and eighty-eight had modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and 120 had breast conservation surgery (BCS). Dose was 40 Gy in 15 fractions to chest wall/breast, and tumor bed boost of 10 Gy in 5 fractions, where indicated, using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Electrons were used in 159 and photons in 149. Single en face electron field was used for chest wall in MRM patients, and tangential photon beams for the whole breast. Patients on follow-up were assessed for locoregional recurrence, chest wall, breast or ipsilateral upper limb edema, brachial neuralgia, local skeletal events, pulmonary and cardiac symptoms, and cosmetic results. Two developed chest wall recurrence, one each in electron and photon arms. No skeletal, cardiac, or pulmonary adverse events were recorded. About 13.6% had arm edema, which was staged according to the International Society of Lymphology lymphedema staging, as Stage I-7.8%, Stage II-3.9%, and Stage III-1.9%. Twenty-six treated with electrons had arm edema. Increased incidence of arm edema in MRM patients could be attributed to combined surgical and radiation morbidity. Five-year overall survival was 81.9%. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionation is an accepted cost-effective standard of care in adjuvant breast radiation. Single en face electron field is well tolerated, and 3DCRT planning ensures homogeneous chest wall coverage, respecting dose constraints to organs at risk."

Between 2005 and 2013, 520 patients aged more than 40 years old were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either WBI or APBI in a 1:1 ratio. Eligible patients were women with early BC (maximum diameter 2.5 cm) suitable for breast conserving surgery. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02104895. A total of 117 patients aged 70 years or more were analyzed (58 in the WBI arm, 59 in the APBI arm). At a median follow-up of 5-years (range 3.4-7.0), the ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) rate was 1.9 % in both groups. No significant difference between the two groups was identified (log-rank test p = 0.96). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates in the WBI group and APBI group were 6.1 and 1.9 %, respectively (p = 0.33). The APBI group presented significantly better results in terms of acute skin toxicity, considering both any grade (p = 0.0001) and grade 2 or higher (p = 0.0001). Our subgroup analyses showed a very low rate and no significant difference in terms of IBTR, using both WBI and APBI. A significant impact on patients compliance in terms of acute and early late toxicity was shown, which could translate in a consistent improvement of overall quality of life."

This overview assembles the available evidence and evaluates to what extent HEE-results can be compared. METHODS: Based on a systematic literature review of HEEs from 1/1/2000 to 30/10/2016, all cost comparison (CC) and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) comparing different adjuvant breast radiotherapy approaches were analysed. Costs were extracted and converted to Euro 2016 and costs per QALY were summarized in cost-effectiveness planes. RESULTS: Twenty-four publications are withheld, comparing different fractionation schedules and/or irradiation techniques or evaluating the value of adding radiotherapy. Normofractionation and intensity-modulated, interstitial or intraluminal techniques are important cost-drivers. Highest reimbursements are observed in the US, but may overestimate the real cost. Hypofractionation is cost-effective compared to normofractionation, the results of partial breast irradiation are less unequivocal. Intra-operative and external beam approaches seem the most cost-effective for favourable risk groups, but whole breast irradiation is superior in terms of health effect and omission of radiotherapy in terms of costs. CONCLUSION: Hypofractionation may be considered the most relevant comparator for new strategies in adjuvant breast radiotherapy, with omission of radiotherapy as an interesting alternative in the very favourable subcategories, especially for partial breast techniques. Although comparison of CC and CEA is hampered by the variability in clinical and economic settings, HEE-based evidence can guide decision-making to tailor-made strategies, allocating the optimal treatment in terms of effectiveness as well as efficiency to the right indication."

Data regarding stereotactic treatment approaches are emerging. The CyberKnife linear accelerator enables excellent dose conformality to target structures while adjusting for target and patient motion. We report our institutional experience on the technical feasibility and rationale for stereotactic accelerated partial breast irradiation (SAPBI) delivery using the CyberKnife radiosurgery system. METHODS: Ten patients completed CyberKnife SAPBI (CK-SAPBI) in 2013 at Georgetown University Hospital. Four gold fiducials were implanted around the lumpectomy cavity prior to treatment under ultrasound guidance. The synchrony system tracked intrafraction motion of the fiducials. The clinical target volume was defined on contrast enhanced CT scans using surgical clips and post-operative changes. A 5 mm expansion was added to create the planning treatment volume (PTV). A total dose of 30 Gy was delivered to the PTV in five consecutive fractions. Target and critical structure doses were assessed as per the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-39 study. RESULTS: At least three fiducials were tracked in 100% of cases. The Mean treated PTV was 70 cm(3) and the mean prescription isodose line was 80%. Mean dose to target volumes and constraints are as follows: 100% of the PTV received the prescription dose (PTV30). The volume of the ipsilateral breast receiving 30 Gy (V30) and above 15 Gy (V > 15) was 14 and 31%, respectively. The ipsilateral lung volume receiving 9 Gy (V9) was 3%, and the contralateral lung volume receiving 1.5 Gy (V1.5) was 8%. For left-sided breast cancers, the volume of heart receiving 1.5 Gy (V1.5) was 31%. Maximum skin dose was 36 Gy. At a median follow-up of 1.3 years, all patients have experienced excellent/good breast cosmesis outcomes, and no breast events have been recorded. CONCLUSION: CyberKnife stereotactic accelerated partial breast irradiation is an appealing technique for partial breast irradiation offering improvements over existing APBI techniques. Our early findings indicate that CK-SAPBI delivered in five daily fractions is feasible, well tolerated, and is a reliable platform for delivering APBI."
