Looking for studies on the treatment or safety effects of Immunoglobulin (Ig) for patients with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) or IgA and IgG paraprotein neuropathies. Excluding other related immunological conditions (GBS, MS, IgM paraprotein neuropathy), or any studies reporting on more than one type of immune condition where CIDP results were not reported separately. Include comparative studies on active comparators: plasma exchange, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants including autologous transfer. Excluding Etanercept, Interferons, Fc receptor inhibitors, Ig capture columns. We require studies that contain comparative results on safety or effectiveness, any RCT on the intervention or any comparators, and extended assessment of harms. Exclude small case reports, opinion pieces, narrative reviews and letters.
