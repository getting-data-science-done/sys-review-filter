Journal Article,Anonymous,2010.0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty for treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: an evidence-based analysis,", ","UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVE OF ANALYSIS: The objective of this analysis is to examine the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) compared with conservative treatment. CLINICAL NEED AND TARGET POPULATION: Osteoporosis and associated fractures are important health issues in ageing populations. Vertebral compression fracture secondary to osteoporosis is a cause of morbidity in older adults. VCFs can affect both genders, but are more common among elderly females and can occur as a result of a fall or a minor trauma. The fracture may occur spontaneously during a simple activity such as picking up an object or rising up from a chair. Pain originating from the fracture site frequently increases with weight bearing. It is most severe during the first few weeks and decreases with rest and inactivity. Traditional treatment of painful VCFs includes bed rest, analgesic use, back bracing and muscle relaxants. The comorbidities associated with VCFs include deep venous thrombosis, acceleration of osteopenea, loss of height, respiratory problems and emotional problems due to chronic pain. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that has gained popularity as a new treatment option in the care for these patients. The technique of vertebroplasty was initially developed in France to treat osteolytic metastasis, myeloma, and hemangioma. The indications were further expanded to painful osteoporotic VCFs and subsequently to treatment of asymptomatic VCFs. The mechanism of pain relief, which occurs within minutes to hours after vertebroplasty, is still not known. Pain pathways in the surrounding tissue appear to be altered in response to mechanical, chemical, vascular, and thermal stimuli after the injection of the cement. It has been suggested that mechanisms other than mechanical stabilization of the fracture, such as thermal injury to the nerve endings, results in immediate pain relief. PERCUTANEOUS VERTEBROPLASTY: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is performed with the patient in prone position and under local or general anesthesia. The procedure involves fluoroscopic imaging to guide the injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebral body to support the fractured bone. After injection of the cement, the patient is placed in supine position for about 1 hour while the cement hardens. Cement leakage is the most frequent complication of vertebroplasty. The leakages may remain asymptomatic or cause symptoms of nerve irritation through compression of nerve roots. There are several reports of pulmonary cement embolism (PCE) following vertebroplasty. In some cases, the PCE may remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic PCE can be recognized by their clinical signs and symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, cyanosis, coughing, hemoptysis, dizziness, and sweating. RESEARCH METHODS: LITERATURE SEARCH: A literature search was performed on Feb 9, 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 2005 to February 9, 2010. Studies were initially reviewed by titles and abstracts. For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained and reviewed. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with an unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist and then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. Data extraction was carried out by the author. INCLUSION CRITERIA: STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vertebroplasty with a control group or other interventions STUDY POPULATION: Adult patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracturesSTUDY SAMPLE SIZE: Studies included 20 or more patientsEnglish language full-reportsPublished between Jan 1 2005 and Feb 9, 2010(eligible studies identified through the Auto Alert function of the search were also included) EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Non-randomized studiesStudies on conditions other than VCF (e.g. patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic tumors)Studies focused on surgical techniquesStudies lacking outcome measures RESULTS OF EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: A systematic search yielded 168 citations. The titles and the abstracts of the citations were reviewed and full text of the identified citations was retrieved for further consideration. Upon review of the full publications and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 5 RCTs were identified. Of these, two compared vertebroplasty with sham procedure, two compared vertebroplasty with conservative treatment, and one compared vertebroplasty with balloon kyphoplasty. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS: Recently, the results of two blinded randomized placebo-controlled trials of percutaneous vertebroplasty were reported. These trials, providing the highest quality of evidence available to date, do not support the use of vertebroplasty in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Based on the results of these trials, vertebroplasty offer no additional benefit over usual care and is not risk free. In these trials the treatment allocation was blinded to the patients and outcome assessors. The control group received a sham procedure simulating vertebroplasty to minimize the effect of expectations and to reduce the potential for bias in self-reporting of outcomes. Both trials applied stringent exclusion criteria so that the results are generalizable to the patient populations that are candidates for vertebroplasty. In both trials vertebroplasty procedures were performed by highly skilled interventionists. Multiple valid outcome measures including pain, physical, mental, and social function were employed to test the between group differences in outcomes. Prior to these two trials, there were two open randomized trials in which vertebroplasty was compared with conservative medical treatment. In the first randomized trial, patients were allowed to cross over to the other arm and had to be stopped after two weeks due to the high numbers of patients crossing over. The other study did not allow cross over and recently published the results of 12 months follow-up. The following is the summary of the results of these 4 trials: Two blinded RCTs on vertebroplasty provide the highest level of evidence available to date. Results of these two trials are supported by findings of an open randomized trial with 12 months follow-up. Blinded RCTs showed: No significant differences in pain scores of patients who received vertebroplasty and patients who received a sham procedure as measured at 3 days, 2 weeks and 1 month in one study and at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the other.The observed differences in pain scores between the two groups were neither statistically significant nor clinically important at any time points.The above findings were consistent with the findings of an open RCT in which patients were followed for 12 months. This study showed that improvement in pain was similar between the two groups at 3 months and were sustained to 12 months.In the blinded RCTs, physical, mental, and social functioning were measured at the above time points using 4-5 of the following 7 instruments: RDQ, EQ-5D, SF-36 PCS, SF-36 MCS, AQoL, QUALEFFO, SOF-ADLThere were no significant differences in any of these measures between patients who received vertebroplasty and patients who received a sham procedure at any of the above time points (with a few exceptions in favour of control intervention).These findings were also consistent with the findings of an open RCT which demonstrated no significant between group differences in scores of ED-5Q, SF-36 PCS, SF 36 MCS, DPQ, Barthel, and MMSE which measure physical, mental, and social functioning (with a few exceptions in favour of control intervention).One small (n=34) open RCT with a two week follow-up detected a significantly higher improvement in pain scores at 1 day after the intervention in vertebroplasty group compared with conservative treatment group. However, at 2 weeks follow-up, this difference was smaller and was not statistically significant.Conservative treatment was associated with fewer clinically important complicationsRisk of new VCFs following vertebroplasty was higher than those in conservative treatment but it requires further investigation.",eng,0.0

Journal Article,Anonymous,2016.0,Vertebral Augmentation Involving Vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty for Cancer-Related Vertebral Compression Fractures: A Systematic Review,", ","BACKGROUND: Cancers that metastasize to the spine and primary cancers such as multiple myeloma can result in vertebral compression fractures or instability. Conservative strategies, including bed rest, bracing, and analgesic use, can be ineffective, resulting in continued pain and progressive functional disability limiting mobility and self-care. Surgery is not usually an option for cancer patients in advanced disease states because of their poor medical health or functional status and limited life expectancy. The objectives of this review were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous image-guided vertebral augmentation techniques, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, for palliation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search for studies on vertebral augmentation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures published from January 1, 2000, to October 2014; abstracts were screened by a single reviewer. For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Owing to the heterogeneity of the clinical reports, we performed a narrative synthesis based on an analytical framework constructed for the type of cancer-related vertebral fractures and the diversity of the vertebral augmentation interventions. RESULTS: The evidence review identified 3,391 citations, of which 111 clinical reports (4,235 patients) evaluated the effectiveness of vertebroplasty (78 reports, 2,545 patients) or kyphoplasty (33 reports, 1,690 patients) for patients with mixed primary spinal metastatic cancers, multiple myeloma, or hemangiomas. Overall the mean pain intensity scores often reported within 48 hours of vertebral augmentation (kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty), were significantly reduced. Analgesic use, although variably reported, usually involved parallel decreases, particularly in opioids, and mean pain-related disability scores were also significantly improved. In a randomized controlled trial comparing kyphoplasty with usual care, improvements in pain scores, pain-related disability, and health-related quality of life were significantly better in the kyphoplasty group than in the usual care group. Bone cement leakage, mostly asymptomatic, was commonly reported after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Major adverse events, however, were uncommon. CONCLUSIONS: Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty significantly and rapidly reduced pain intensity in cancer patients with vertebral compression fractures. The procedures also significantly decreased the need for opioid pain medication, and functional disabilities related to back and neck pain. Pain palliative improvements and low complication rates were consistent across the various cancer populations and vertebral fractures that were investigated.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,Anonymous,2016.0,Vertebral Augmentation Involving Vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty for Cancer-Related Vertebral Compression Fractures: An Economic Analysis,", ","BACKGROUND: Untreated vertebral compression fractures can have serious clinical consequences and impose a considerable impact on patients' quality of life and on caregivers. Since non-surgical management of these fractures has limited effectiveness, vertebral augmentation procedures are gaining acceptance in clinical practice for pain control and fracture stabilization. The objective of this analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty compared with non-surgical management for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in patients with cancer. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of health economic studies to identify relevant studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty with non-surgical management for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in adults with cancer. We also performed a primary cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the clinical benefits and costs of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty compared with non-surgical management in the same population. We developed a Markov model to forecast benefits and harms of treatments, and corresponding quality-adjusted life years and costs. Clinical data and utility data were derived from published sources, while costing data were derived using Ontario administrative sources. We performed sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of the results. In addition, a 1-year budget impact analysis was performed using data from Ontario administrative sources. Two scenarios were explored: (a) an increase in the total number of vertebral augmentation procedures performed among patients with cancer in Ontario, maintaining the current proportion of kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty; and (b) no increase in the total number of vertebral augmentation procedures performed among patients with cancer in Ontario but an increase in the proportion of kyphoplasties versus vertebroplasties. RESULTS: The base case considered each of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty versus non-surgical management. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty were associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $33,471 and $17,870, respectively, per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The budgetary impact of funding vertebral augmentation procedures for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in adults with cancer in Ontario was estimated at about $2.5 million in fiscal year 2014/15. More widespread use of vertebral augmentation procedures raised total expenditures under a number of scenarios, with costs increasing by $67,302 to $913,386. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the use of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty in the management of vertebral compression fractures in patients with cancer may be a cost-effective strategy at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds. Nonetheless, more widespread use of kyphoplasty (and vertebroplasty to a lesser extent) would likely be associated with net increases in health care costs.",eng,0.0

A series of nine cases and review of literature,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2013.05.053,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Percutaneous augmentation with bone cement is a widely accepted modality of treatment for thoracic and lumbar vertebral osteoporotic fractures. Infection after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is a serious, yet, rarely reported complication.
PURPOSE: To present a case series with a long-term follow-up of spinal infection after vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty with analysis of preoperative condition, risk factors, diagnostic findings, time before reoperation, causative organism, treatment, and outcome.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, uncontrolled clinical case series in a single institution.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Between January 1997 and June 2012, 1,307 patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Six cases had postoperative infection (0.46%) and three additional cases were referred from other institutions for salvage treatment.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Perioperative assessment included visual analog scale, clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, and activities of daily living at the end of the follow-up.
METHODS: Nine patients were included: six females and three males (mean age 73.8 years). Comorbidities were found in all patients. Kyphoplasty had been done in five patients and vertebroplasty in four.
RESULTS: The interval between augmentation and revision surgery ranged from 10 to 395 days with a mean of 118.4 days. Three cases with early infection presented within 1 month. Infection parameters were high in all patients at readmission. All patients were treated surgically except one case who died before the planned revision surgery. In all cases, debridement and corpectomy were done through anterior approaches combined with posterior instrumentation. The most common causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus in three cases. Mean follow-up period after the revision surgery was 26.68 months, excluding two patients who died early in the follow-up (within 4 months). This amounts to a mortality rate of 33.3% perioperatively. At the end of follow-up, two patients had unrestricted activities and one patient required a walker. Of three paraparetic patients, two improved functionally and could walk unassisted and one improved but still used a wheelchair.
CONCLUSIONS: Although vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive interventions, postoperative infection can develop into life-threatening complications. This should be accounted for, in decision making in the elderly age group most commonly affected by osteoporotic fractures and especially in suspicious and high-risk immune-compromised patients.

OBJECTIVE: To inform clinicians about delayed clinical manifestation of pulmonary embolism of polymethylmethacrylate material after percutaneous vertebroplasty, pathophysiology, precautions, and therapeutic management of this complication. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimal invasive intervention used to treat vertebral fractures, which yields good therapeutic results and rarely produces complications. Nevertheless, serious complications may occur. Pulmonary PMMA embolism, which has been recently reported in some cases, is one of these. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report on 2 cases of pulmonary embolism of PMMA material after percutaneous vertebroplasty. In the case of a 45-year-old female patient, symptoms of pulmonary embolism arose with a delay of 3 days following percutaneous vertebroplasty. A therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin, Enoxaparin, enabled recovery from pulmonary failure. The second case occurred without detection of any cement leakage into the paravertebral venous system, neither intraoperatively nor perioperatively. The existence of PMMA in pulmonary vessels was detected 1 year later and remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: These 2 cases allow us to conclude that the risk of pulmonary embolism of PMMA might be underestimated. We propose routine chest radiograph following every vertebroplasty, in order to detect pulmonary PMMA embolism and thereby prevent serious delayed cardiopulmonary failures.",eng,1.0

A Study in Vertebral Analogues,10.1055/s-0035-1546818,"Study Design A biomechanical and radiographic study using vertebral analogues. Objectives Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are widely used techniques to alleviate pain in fractures secondary to osteoporosis. However, cement leakage toward vital structures like the spinal cord can be a major source of morbidity and even mortality. We define safe cement injection as the volume of the cement injected into a vertebra before the cement leakage occurs. Our objective is to compare the amount of cement that can be safely injected into an osteoporotic vertebra with simulated compression fracture using either vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty techniques. Methods Forty artificial vertebral analogues made of polyurethane with osteoporotic cancellous matrix representing the L3 vertebrae were used for this study and were divided into four groups of 10 vertebrae each. The four groups tested were: low-viscosity cement injected using vertebroplasty, high-viscosity cement injected using vertebroplasty, low-viscosity cement injected using balloon kyphoplasty, and high-viscosity cement injected using balloon kyphoplasty. The procedures were performed under fluoroscopic guidance. The injection was stopped when the cement started protruding from the created vascular channel in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture model. The main outcome measured was the volume of the cement injected safely into a vertebra before leakage through the posterior vascular channel. Results The highest volume of the cement injected was in the vertebroplasty group using high-viscosity cement, which was almost twice the injected volume in the other three groups. One-way analysis of variance comparing the four groups showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.005). Conclusions High-viscosity cement injected using vertebroplasty delivers more cement volume before cement leakage and fills the vertebral body more uniformly when compared with balloon kyphoplasty in osteoporotic vertebrae with compression fractures.",eng,0.0

Abumi,2013.0,A novel 3D guidance system using augmented reality for percutaneous vertebroplasty: technical note,10.3171/2013.7.spine12917,"Augmented reality (AR) is an imaging technology by which virtual objects are overlaid onto images of real objects captured in real time by a tracking camera. This study aimed to introduce a novel AR guidance system called virtual protractor with augmented reality (VIPAR) to visualize a needle trajectory in 3D space during percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). The AR system used for this study comprised a head-mount display (HMD) with a tracking camera and a marker sheet. An augmented scene was created by overlaying the preoperatively generated needle trajectory path onto a marker detected on the patient using AR software, thereby providing the surgeon with augmented views in real time through the HMD. The accuracy of the system was evaluated by using a computer-generated simulation model in a spine phantom and also evaluated clinically in 5 patients. In the 40 spine phantom trials, the error of the insertion angle (EIA), defined as the difference between the attempted angle and the insertion angle, was evaluated using 3D CT scanning. Computed tomography analysis of the 40 spine phantom trials showed that the EIA in the axial plane significantly improved when VIPAR was used compared with when it was not used (0.96 degrees +/- 0.61 degrees vs 4.34 degrees +/- 2.36 degrees , respectively). The same held true for EIA in the sagittal plane (0.61 degrees +/- 0.70 degrees vs 2.55 degrees +/- 1.93 degrees , respectively). In the clinical evaluation of the AR system, 5 patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures underwent VIPAR-guided PVP from October 2011 to May 2012. The postoperative EIA was evaluated using CT. The clinical results of the 5 patients showed that the EIA in all 10 needle insertions was 2.09 degrees +/- 1.3 degrees in the axial plane and 1.98 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees in the sagittal plane. There was no pedicle breach or leakage of polymethylmethacrylate. VIPAR was successfully used to assist in needle insertion during PVP by providing the surgeon with an ideal insertion point and needle trajectory through the HMD. The findings indicate that AR guidance technology can become a useful assistive device during spine surgeries requiring percutaneous procedures.",eng,0.0

Ames",2005.0,Kyphoplasty-augmented short-segment pedicle screw fixation of traumatic lumbar burst fractures: initial clinical experience and literature review,", ","OBJECT: Surgical intervention for thoracolumbar burst fractures is indicated for patients with neurological deficits and/or evidence of severe spinal instability. The goals of surgery are decompression, deformity correction, and stabilization. Nevertheless, the optimal surgical strategy to achieve these goals remains a subject of debate. Short-segment pedicle screw fixation is associated with a 20 to 50% incidence of pedicle screw failure and progressive spinal deformity. Initial biomechanical and clinical studies have shown that reinforcement of short-segment pedicle screw fixation with vertebroplasty improves spinal stability and decreases instrument failure rates. In this study, the authors describe their initial clinical experience with kyphoplasty used to augment short-segment pedicle screw fixation of traumatic lumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Five patients with traumatic burst fractures of the lumbar spine were included in this retrospective review of patients treated for this disorder at the University of California, San Diego and the University of California, San Francisco between 2002 and 2004. All patients underwent transpedicular kyphoplasty and short-segment pedicle screw fixation. The mean follow-up period was 10.6 months (range 6-18 months). All patients underwent short-segment pedicle screw fixation reinforced with polymethyl methacrylate kyphoplasty. The preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up plain x-ray films were evaluated. Radiographic analysis included measurements of kyphotic angulation, anterior vertebral body height, and evidence of bone fusion. Clinical evaluation was performed postoperatively and at follow-up review. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the authors' initial experience, kyphoplasty supplementation may improve the long-term integrity of short-segment pedicle screw constructs and allow for improved rates of fusion and better clinical outcomes in patients with traumatic lumbar burst fractures.",eng,0.0

Treatment included transarterial embolization, embolization followed by surgical decompression or vertebral reconstruction with arthrodesis, and percutaneous vertebroplasty alone. METHODS: All medical, surgical, and radiological records were reviewed retrospectively. All patients underwent follow-up neurological examination and evaluation of back pain. RESULTS: Sixteen patients diagnosed with symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas causing pain or neurological deficit were treated at University of California, San Francisco, between 1984 and 2004. Mean follow-up was 81 months. Seven of nine patients undergoing surgical decompression and tumor resection reported pain relief and demonstrated improvement in neurological deficit when present. Two patients had recurrent myelopathy: one was successfully treated with a second decompressive surgery, whereas the second underwent a staged vertebrectomy. All three patients undergoing vertebrectomy had cord compression from extraosseous tumor growth. Preoperative embolization reduced expected intraoperative blood loss in four patients. Three of four patients who underwent transarterial embolization alone experienced resolution of back pain. Two of four patients treated with vertebroplasty had long-term pain relief. CONCLUSION: Transarterial embolization followed by laminectomy is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of cord compression by vertebral hemangioma causing stenosis without instability or deformity. Vertebrectomy preceded by embolization and followed by reconstruction can be used to treat cord compression from extraosseous tumor extension. Transarterial embolization without decompression is an effective treatment for painful intraosseous hemangiomas. Vertebroplasty is useful for improving pain symptoms, especially when vertebral body compression fracture has occurred in patients without neurological deficit, but is less effective in providing long-term pain relief.",eng,1.0

Journal Article,M. A. Adams; P. Dolan,2011.0,Biomechanics of vertebral compression fractures and clinical application,10.1007/s00402-011-1355-9,"Local biomechanical factors in the etiology of vertebral compression fractures are reviewed. The vertebral body is particularly vulnerable to compression fracture when its bone mineral density (BMD) falls with age. However, the risk of fracture, and the type of fracture produced, does not depend simply on BMD. Equally important is the state of degeneration of the adjacent intervertebral discs, which largely determines how compressive forces are distributed over the vertebral body. Disc height also influences load-sharing between the vertebral body and neural arch, and hence by Wolff's Law can influence regional variations in trabecular density within the vertebral body. Vertebral deformity is not entirely attributable to trauma: it can result from the gradual accumulation of fatigue damage, and can progress by a quasi-continuous process of creep"". Cement injection techniques such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are valuable in the treatment of these fractures. Both techniques can stiffen a fractured vertebral body, and kyphoplasty may contribute towards restoring its height. The presence of cement can limit endplate deformation, and thereby partially reverse the adverse changes in load-sharing which follow vertebral fracture. Cement also reduces time-dependent ""creep"" deformation of damaged vertebrae.""",eng,0.0

However, when back pain persists in the course of conservatively treated osteoporotic vertebra fractures, a non-union should be considered. We thus sought to validate our diagnostic algorithm in patients with known osteoporotic vertebra fractures presenting persistent back pain and advert to the diagnosis and treatment of vertebral non-unions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients admitted with preexisting osteoporotic vertebra fractures and therapy-resistant back pain were retrospectively analysed. All admitted patients were subject to standard plain radiographs in erect position and conventional CT or MR imaging of the spine, respectively. In addition, patients with suspected non-union were subject to lateral fulcrum radiographs in supine position. RESULTS: From a total of 172 admitted patients, four patients presented with non-union of a fractured osteoporotic vertebra (2%). The subsequent surgical therapy included cement-augmented rod-and-screw stabilization, with or without additional correction of deformity, and kyphoplasty (N = 3) or kyphoplasty alone (N = 1). All surgical interventions were successful in pain reduction and allowed immediate and improved postoperative mobilisation. CONCLUSIONS: Non-union of osteoporotic vertebra fractures must be considered when symptoms outlast conservative treatment. In these cases, plain lateral fulcrum radiographs are a simple and effective adjunct to the conventional diagnostic methods. Surgical stabilization then proves to be the effective treatment of choice.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVES: To define accurate temperature profiles during vertebroplasty in an in vivo animal model. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Controversy still exists whether vertebroplasty achieves its analgesic effect by stabilizing fracture fragments or due to thermal damage of sensory nerves inside the vertebral body. Furthermore, the energy release during cement polymerization may cause thermal injury to the spinal cord or intervertebral discs. METHODS: A total of 4.0 mL PMMA was injected into three lumbar vertebrae of four skeletally mature mixed-bred ewes. Nine separate K-type thermocouples were placed into 12 vertebrae and their adjacent intervertebral discs. Temperature changes were recorded continuously before, during, and after the injection. RESULTS: The highest peak temperatures were measured at the cranial endplate (mean 42.4 +/- 8.8 C) and in the center of the vertebral body (mean 43.3 +/- 6.9 C). Temperatures stayed above 40 C for approximately 2.5 minutes. Peak temperatures in the discs and at the dorsal wall (closest to spinal cord) did not exceed 41 C and 47 C and stayed above 40 C for approximately 1.5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: The intervertebral discs and the spinal cord do not seem to be in danger of thermal damage during vertebroplasty. The measured energy does not seem to be sufficient for the palliative effect achieved by vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the sequential occurrence of fat embolism and hypotension during vertebroplasty.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty, the augmentation of vertebrae with polymethylmethacrylate, is a technique for treating osteoporotic compression fractures and achieving prophylactic stabilization of osteoporotic vertebral bodies at risk of fracture. However, there is concern that fat embolism and acute hypotension could occur as in a variety of other orthopedic procedures.
METHODS: In six sheep, 6 mL of polymethylmethacrylate was injected unilaterally into L1. Transesophageal echocardiography monitored the pulmonary artery for echodense particles. Heart rate, arterial and venous pressures, and blood gas values were recorded before and for 25 minutes after injection. The lungs were subjected to postmortem histologic evaluation and compared with lung specimens from two sheep that had not undergone vertebroplasty.
RESULTS: Injection of cement elicited a very rapid decrease in heart rate (within 2 +/- 1 seconds) and a rapid increase in venous pressure (within 3 +/- 1 seconds), which was followed by a fall in arterial pressure (within 5 +/- 2 seconds) (phase 1). Thereafter, showers of echogenic material appeared (within 6 +/- 1 seconds) and lasted for 138 +/- 36 seconds. A second more severe fall in arterial pressure was observed beginning at 18 +/- 2 seconds (phase 2). The injection resulted in an increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and a decrease in pH. The histology showed intravascular fat globules and bone marrow cells in lung tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that immediately after cement injection, there was a reflex fall in heart rate and arterial pressure. The second fall in arterial pressure was a consequence of fat emboli passing through the heart and getting trapped in the lungs.",English,1.0

Short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation is a well described technique to reduce and stabilize thoracic and lumbar spine fractures. It is relatively a easy procedure but can only indirectly reduce a fractured vertebral body, and the means of augmenting the anterior column are limited. Hardware failure and a loss of reduction are recognized complications caused by insufficient anterior column support. Patients with traumatic lumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficits were included. After a short segment posterior reduction and fixation, bilateral transpedicular reduction of the endplate was performed using a balloon, and polymethyl methacrylate cement was injected. Pre-operative and post-operative central and anterior heights were assessed with radiographs and MRI. Sixteen patients underwent this procedure, and a substantial reduction of the endplates could be achieved with the technique. All patients recovered uneventfully, and the neurologic examination revealed no deficits. The post-operative radiographs and magnetic resonance images demonstrated a good fracture reduction and filling of the bone defect without unwarranted bone displacement. The central and anterior height of the vertebral body could be restored to 72 and 82% of the estimated intact height, respectively. Complications were cement leakage in three cases without clinical implications and one superficial wound infection. Posterior short-segment pedicle fixation in conjunction with balloon vertebroplasty seems to be a feasible option in the management of lumbar burst fractures, thereby addressing all the three columns through a single approach. Although cement leakage occurred but had no clinical consequences or neurological deficit.",eng,0.0

The lifetime risk of a vertebral body compression fracture is 16% for women and 5% for men, and exponential increase of osteoporotic fractures worldwide. PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy and durability of percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of back pain associated with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. DESIGN: A prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective evaluation of pain relief in 30 patients, with mean age of 73.7 years, who underwent percutaneous injection of polymethyl methacrylate into 54 vertebrae under fluoroscopic guidance over a period of 35 months was done. Before the procedure and at follow up, patients were asked to quantify their pain on a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: The procedure was technically successful in all the patients. Mean duration of follow up was 21.5 months (6-44 months). Ninety-seven percent of the patients reported a significant relief 24 hours after the procedure. Ninety-two percent reported significant improvement in back pain, previously associated with a compression fracture, as well as improved ambulatory ability. Before vertebroplasty, the VAS score was 8.91+/- 1.82 compared to a score of 2.02+/- 1.95 at follow up. The mean difference in VAS score was significant (p<.0001). One patient had an asymptomatic epidural leak of PMMA, however did not require any further intervention.

RECENT FINDINGS: The natural history of VCFs in the cancer setting is presumably different from the one seen with osteoporotic fractures. Factors contributing to the poor outcome with conservative treatment in cancer patients include continued bone loss due to tumor invasion, poor nutritional status, immobilization, prolonged steroid use, gonadal ablation, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. VAPs have been shown by retrospective and prospective randomized studies to be effective in treating symptomatic VCFs. Advantages of VAPs include immediate pain relief, avoiding delays in chemoradiation, outpatient care in the majority of cases, biopsy, vertebral height restoration, and potential antitumor effect of bone cement. Results from the prospective randomized Cancer Fracture Evaluation (CAFE) trial show superiority of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) over conservative management in cancer patients with VCFs with similar rate of adverse events between treatment arms. Additionally, the field is still evolving with advances such as combination with radiosurgery and spinal radiofrequency ablation (RFA), use of kyphoplasty without a balloon and highly viscous cement to prevent leakage.
SUMMARY: VAPs are well tolerated and effective methods to provide palliative care for cancer patients with VCFs and should be offered to symptomatic patients.",English,1.0

Hydroxyapatite and Brushite were introduced in an acrylic two-solution cement at varying concentrations. Novel composite bone cements were developed and characterized using rheology, injectability, and mechanical tests. It was hypothesized that the ample swelling time allowed by the premixed two-solution cement would enable thorough dispersion of the additives in the solutions, resulting in no detrimental effects after polymerization. The addition of Hydroxyapatite and Brushite both caused an increase in cement viscosity; however, these cements exhibited high shear-thinning, which facilitated injection. In gel point studies, the composite cements showed no detectable change in gel point time compared to an all-acrylic control cement. Hydroxyapatite and Brushite composite cements were observed to have high mechanical strengths even at high loads of calcium phosphate fillers. These cements showed an average compressive strength of 85 MPa and flexural strength of 65 MPa. A calcium phosphate-containing cement exhibiting a combination of high viscosity, pseudoplasticity and high mechanical strength can provide the essential bioactivity factor for osseointegration without sacrificing load-bearing capability.",eng,0.0

There have been two previous reports of fatal fat embolism following vertebroplasty. Here we describe a case of fat embolism syndrome following this procedure, and also provide fluoroscopic video evidence consistent with this occurrence. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to review the literature and report a case of fat embolism syndrome in a patient who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty for compression fracture. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The study design for this manuscript was of a clinical case report. METHODS: A 68-year-old woman who developed sudden back pain with minimal trauma was found to have a T6 vertebral compression fracture on radiographs and bone scans. Percutaneous vertebroplasty of T5 and T6 was performed. RESULTS: Fluoroscopic imaging during the procedure demonstrated compression and rarefaction of the fractured vertebra associated with changes in intrathoracic pressure. Immediately after the procedure, the patient's back pain resolved and she was discharged home. Two days later, she developed increasing respiratory distress, confusion, and chest pain. A petechial rash on her upper arms also appeared. No evidence of bone cement leakage or pulmonary filling defects were seen on computed tomography-pulmonary angiography. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated hyperintensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. A diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome was made, and the patient recovered with conservative management. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a relatively safe and simple procedure, reducing pain and improving functional limitations in patients with vertebral fractures. This case demonstrates an uncommon yet serious complication of fat embolism syndrome. Clinicians must be aware of this complication when explaining the procedure to patients and provide prompt supportive care when it does occur.",eng,1.0

PURPOSE: An attempt was made to modify the properties of PMMA to make it more suitable for percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The expected mechanical changes by adding a filler into PMMA included decreasing the Young's modulus, polymerization temperature and setting time. These changes in PMMA were considered to be more suitable and adaptable conditions in PVP for an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. METHODS: Porous PMMA were produced by mixing 2 ml (B2), 4 ml (B4) and 6 ml (B6) of blood as a filler with 20 g of regular PMMA. The mechanical properties were examined and compared with regular PMMA(R) in view of the Young's modulus, polymerization temperature, setting time and optimal passing-time within an injectable viscosity (20-50 N-needed) through a 2.8 mm-diameter cement-filler tube. The porosity was examined using microcomputed tomography. RESULTS: The Young's modulus decreased from 919.5 MPa (R) to 701.0 MPa (B2), 693.5 Mpa (B4), and 545.6 MPa (B6). The polymerization temperature decreased from 74.2 (R) to 59.8 (B2), 54.2 (B4) and 47.5 (B6). The setting time decreased from 1,065 seconds (R) to 624 seconds (B2), 678 seconds (B4), and 606 seconds (B6), and the optimal passing-time decreased from 75.6 seconds (R) to 46.6 seconds (B2), 65.0 seconds (B4), and 79.0 seconds (B6). The porosity increased from 4.2% (R) to 27.6% (B2), 27.5% (B4) and 29.5% (B6). A homogenous microstructure with very fine pores was observed in all blood-mixed PMMAs. CONCLUSIONS: Blood is an excellent filler for PMMA. Group B6 showed more suitable mechanical properties, including a lower elastic modulus due to the higher porosity, less heating and retarded optimal passing-time by the serum barrier, which reduced the level of friction between PMMA and a cement-filler tube.",eng,0.0

If an allograft is used as a filler, most of them can be averted. METHODS: Forty consecutive cases of osteoporotic vertebral fracture were divided into two groups by self-selection. The study and the control groups underwent vertebroplasty with fresh frozen allogeneic bone chips and bone cement, respectively. Clinical results were assessed at preoperation, postoperative day 1 and months 3, 6, and 12 by 10-grade visual analog scale (VAS), and radiological results were assessed at the same time by vertebral kyphotic angle (VKA) and local kyphotic angle (LKA). The results were compared within and between the groups. Survival function was analyzed. The criteria of an event were clinical or radiological deterioration versus pre-index surgery state. RESULTS: VAS was improved in the study group from 8.4 +/- 0.8 to 5.2 +/- 1.4, 6.4 +/- 1.2, 5.5 +/- 2.7, and 3.7 +/- 1.4 at postoperative day 1 and months 3, 6, and 12, respectively, and in the control group from 8.4 +/- 1.2 to 3.2 +/- 1.1, 3.2 +/- 1.7, 3.2 +/- 2.7, and 2.5 +/- 1.7, respectively (within group, p < 0.001; between groups, p < 0.001).

LKA was not improved in the study group but was improved in the control group from 16.8 degrees +/- 11.7 degrees to 14.3 degrees +/- 9.6 degrees (p = 0.015). Correction angle was 2.7 degrees +/- 4.6 degrees , -7.9 degrees +/- 5.3 degrees , -7.2 degrees +/- 5.2 degrees , and -7.4 degrees +/- 6.3 degrees at postoperative day 1 and months 3, 6, and 12, respectively, in the study group and 4.3 degrees +/- 3.7 degrees , 0.7 degrees +/- 3.6 degrees , 0.7 degrees +/- 4.2 degrees , and 0.1 degrees +/- 4.4 degrees , respectively, in the control group.

Prophylactic vertebroplasty has the potential to reduce pain and the risk of burst fracture in the metastatic spine. The purpose of this study was to quantify the ability of vertebroplasty to stabilize metastatically involved vertebrae against the risk of burst fracture initiation with a standardized model of vertebral metastases. METHODS: Metastases were simulated in eight fresh-frozen cadaveric thoracolumbar spinal motion segments by removing a central core of trabecular bone and filling the defect with tumor tissue. Specimens were tested under a physiologic level of axial compression, intact, with a simulated tumor and post-vertebroplasty, and ultimately tested to failure. Axial load induced canal narrowing (CN) was used as a measure of the risk of burst fracture initiation. Following testing, vertebrae were axially sectioned to visualize cement fill. RESULTS: Vertebrae with simulated metastases exhibited significantly higher CN than intact specimens (227%+/-109%; P<0.05). Post vertebroplasty, three vertebrae exhibited reduced CN compared with the simulated tumor configuration, whereas the other five had increased CN. Specimens with reduced CN were found to have cement posterior to the tumor, whereas specimens with an increase in CN had cement anterior and lateral to the tumor only. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is effective in decreasing CN if tumor is surrounded posteriorly with cement. However, injecting cement into the posterior third of the vertebral body is risky due to potential extravasation into the canal. CONCLUSION: Future work aimed at improving cement fill is necessary for safe and consistent stabilization of the metastatic spine with vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

METHODS: The medical records of 508 consecutive patients treated with PVP between January 2000 and December 2002 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 45 patients with 49 painful vertebral fractures occurring after PVP was identified based on clinical and radiological findings. New vertebral fractures, developing at any of the 3 consecutive vertebral bodies (VBs) above or below the previously treated level, were the focus of the study. The patients were divided into 3 groups: an adjacent-level fracture group, nonadjacent-level fracture group, and a control group composed of 50 randomly selected patients in whom there was no evidence of a new fracture. Clinical, imaging, and procedure-related factors for each group were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: In 31 patients 35 VBs were classified as adjacent-level fractures, and in 14 patients 14 VBs were classified as nonadjacent-level fractures. After further vertebroplasty, the overall pain intensity and satisfaction rate in patients with post-PVP fractures were similar to those in the control group. In cases involving adjacent fractures, lower body mass index and intradiscal cement leakage were the significant predictive factors of fracture. In contrast, lower mobility of the index segment was related to nonadjacent-level fracture. CONCLUSIONS: According to the authors' results, the mechanisms of subsequent fracture at adjacent and nonadjacent vertebrae are different. A direct pillar effect (that is, the difference in strength caused by cement augmentation) may provoke an adjacent-level fracture, whereas a dynamic hammer effect (the difference in segmental mobility) may lead to a nonadjacent fracture.",eng,1.0

Lee,2011.0,Vertebroplasty for adjacent vertebral fracture following lumbar interbody fusion,10.3109/02688697.2010.508848,"PURPOSE: Adjacent segment vertebral compression fracture after lumbosacral instrumented fusion has been reported to be a significant complication. Recently, percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has been widely used for the treatment of non-traumatic osteoporotic vertebral fracture. However, the clinical effect of this minimally invasive treatment option to the post-fusion vertebral fracture has rarely been reported. We analysed characteristics of adjacent vertebral fractures following lumbar fusion and evaluated the clinical outcome of PVP. METHODS: A total of 202 consecutive patients underwent PVP for compression fracture in our institute between January 2007 and December 2008. Among them, nine symptomatic adjacent vertebral fractures following lumbar fusion were identified. We randomly selected 50 control patients undergoing vertebroplasty for osteoporotic compression fracture in single level. We analysed the clinical data according to age, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), and bone mineral density (BMD). Clinical outcome was assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the rate of overall satisfaction. RESULTS: Fractures occurred at the cranial adjacent vertebra after fusion surgery in all cases. The mean BMD score for the spine and femur were significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.05). After PVP, the mean VAS score improved from 8.1 to 3.2. The overall satisfaction rate was 88.9%. Other constitutional factors and clinical outcomes were similar to the control group. CONCLUSION: Adjacent vertebral fracture following lumbar fusion may occur as a kind of adjacent segment disease. The increased stress around the fusion segment can cause vertebral fracture even with a relatively higher BMD score. Vertebroplasty for the post-fusion vertebral fracture can be as effective as it is for the usual osteoporotic vertebral fracture.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,F. Al-Ali; T. Barrow; K.

This prospective study evaluated the potential of vertebroplasty to increase the likelihood of an adjacent vertebral compression fracture (VCF) 1 year or less after vertebroplasty, the correlation between the cement volumes injected and pain relief, and the consequences of cement extravasation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pain relief and the incidence of a subsequent fracture of adjacent vertebrae 1 year or less after vertebroplasty were evaluated in 357 patients (660 vertebrae) of mean age 77.5 years with osteoporotic VCFs. The correlation between cement volume and pain relief was assessed with a Pearson correlation coefficient; factors potentially predictive of subsequent adjacent VCFs were explored by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Refracture of any vertebrae (adjacent or nonadjacent to the primary fracture) occurred in 18% of the patients 1 year or less after vertebroplasty. Refracture of adjacent vertebrae occurred 1 year or less after vertebroplasty in 12% of the patients. Neither cement volume nor extravasation of cement into the intravertebral disk was a significant predictor of adjacent VCFs. No correlation was found between cement volume and pain relief (r = -0.029). Extravasation of cement into the veins, soft tissue, or disk was observed in 33% of all of the treated VCFs and resulted in no complications. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of an adjacent VCF 1 year or less after vertebroplasty was comparable with that expected for untreated osteoporotic VCFs. Neither the volume of cement injected nor extravasation of cement into the intravertebral disk affected the likelihood of subsequent adjacent VCFs.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to describe a case of infected vertebroplasty due to uncommon bacteria solved surgically with 2 years of follow-up and to discuss 6 other cases found in literature. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is a well-known and useful technique for the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Complications, such as cord or root compression or pulmonary embolisms, are infrequent and are mainly related with the frequent escape of cement throughout the vertebral veins. Infection is even more rare, but when it occurs is difficult to manage and can be a life-threatening complication. METHODS: A 63-year-old-man had a spondylitis of L2 after vertebroplasty. The patient was initially managed with antibiotics without clinical improvement. Surgical treatment by anterior debridement and anterior and posterior stabilization was done. The bacteria isolated from the intraoperative cultures were Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Burkholderia cepacia. After surgery, the patient was treated with antibiotics for 3 month. RESULTS: After 2 years of follow-up, the patient was free of pain, without signs of infection, and a correct fusion was achieved. CONCLUSION: When facing an infected vertebroplasty, initial conservative treatment with needle biopsy culture and antibiotic administration are a rational option to start. If this treatment fails, surgical debridement is then indicated in order to remove the infected tissue and the acrylic cement and to stabilize the spine. Although this can be an effective treatment, it could be a difficult and hazardous surgical procedure.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Eighty-seven myeloma patients (mean age: 64.7 +/- 9.5 years) with VCF were treated with RF-TVA. Patient data were assessed preoperatively and in five postoperative examinations up to 12 months. Pain was measured with the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the impairment was evaluated with the Oswestry-Disability-Index (ODI) at each examination. In addition, the mid vertebral height, kyphosis angle, and additional fractures were evaluated by x-rays. Furthermore, cement leakage was documented. RESULTS: The VAS values were significantly improved in comparison to the preoperative values (p</= 0.001), but slightly fluctuating during the follow-up period. The ODI was also significantly improved (p</= 0.001), but it showed a worsening from the 12 months evaluation to the 24 months evaluation. The kyphosis angle and the vertebral height were significantly improved after surgery (p = 0.03, p </= 0.001), but worsened steadily to the last follow up examination. Cement leakage was asymptomatic and occurred in 18% of the patients. In 10% of the patients additional fractures were detected in the 24 months evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that RF-TVA is a safe treatment for myeloma associated vertebral compression fractures, which achieves an acceptable improvement of patient's pain and quality of life.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,J. Allain,2011.0,Anterior spine surgery in recent thoracolumbar fractures: An update,10.1016/j.otsr.2011.06.003,"Surgical treatment of thoracolumbar spine fractures aims to achieve bony union and restore spinal anatomy. It may associate, as needed, decompression, reduction, graft and/or internal fixation, using a posterior, anterior or combined approach. Indications for an anterior approach weigh the pros and cons as well as the type of osteo-ligamentous lesion, degree of instability and patient's neurological status. The main interest of an anterior approach is to enable medullary decompression by corporectomy while allowing reconstruction of the anterior spine. The technique was less frequently used mainly due to its associated morbidity risk; but the development of videoscopy tools now allows less invasive surgery, compared to conventional thoracophrenolombotomy. Given also the mechanical drawbacks of posterior assembly in certain types of fracture, a video-assisted anterior approach is becoming more common. A conjunction of a staged anterior followed by a posterior approach has progressively developed, to address the needs of spinal trauma: this encompasses posterior surgical reduction-internal fixation, sometimes performed in emergency, with or without laminectomy followed by corporectomy, then anterior spinal reconstruction by graft with or without osteosynthesis to improve medullary decompression and avoid secondary correction loss and non-union. Adapting vertebroplasty techniques to spinal traumatology should gradually limit indications for an anterior approach for purely mechanical purposes; this later will, however, logically remain indicated when anterior spinal cord compression is present with associated neurological deficit, whether or not persisting after posterior reduction-osteosynthesis.",eng,0.0

A report of twelve cases,10.15274/inr-2014-10019,"Percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) is a minimally invasive technique for the treatment of vertebral pathology providing early vertebral stabilization and pain relief. In cases of vertebral pathology complicated by spinal cord compression with associated neurological deficits, VP alone cannot be performed free of risks. We describe a combined approach in which decompressive laminectomy and intra-operative vertebroplasty (IVP) are performed during a single session. Among the 252 VP performed in our centre in the past three years, 12 patients (12 vertebral levels) with different pathologies (six symptomatic haemangiomas, two metastatic fractures, four osteoporotic fractures) were treated with an open procedure combined with surgery. All cases were treated with decompressive laminectomy and IVP (mono/bipeduncular or median-posterior trans-somatic access). Five patients with symptomatic haemangiomas were treated with endovascular embolization prior to the combined approach. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was applied to assess pain intensity before and after surgery. The neurological deficits were evaluated with an ASIA impairment scale. In all cases benefit from pain and neurological deficits was observed. The mean VAS score decreased from 7.8 to 2.5 after surgery. The ASIA score improved in all cases (five cases from D to E and five cases from C to D). No clinical complications were observed. In one case a CT scan performed after the procedure showed a foraminal accumulation of PMMA, but the patient referred no symptoms. IVP can be successfully applied in different pathologies affecting the vertebrae. In our limited series this approach proved safe and efficient to provide decompression of spinal cord and dural sac and vertebral body stabilization in a single session.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate biopsy results obtained during vertebral augmentation (kyphoplasty) for presumed/confirmed osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Kyphoplasty to augment vertebrae in osteoporotic VCFs is well established. When VCF etiology is in question, bone biopsy can be performed at that time. Biopsy results, however, can be misleading without careful clinical correlation. METHODS: From July 2003 to July 2006, 94 vertebral biopsies were obtained from 66 patients during kyphoplasty for VCFs. Average patient age was 73 (range, 22-99), including 47 females and 19 males. There were 48 one-level, 17 two-level, and 4 three-level biopsies. Biopsy levels included: T6 (3), T7 (7), T8 (7), T9 (3), T10 (3), T11 (8), T12 (21), L1 (18), L2 (13), L3 (8), L4 (2), L5 (1). Histologic/immunohistochemical evaluations were performed. RESULTS: All specimens showed features of fracture in various stages of bony healing. Initially, 13 of 66 (19.7%) cases were read by a surgical pathologist as chronic inflammation, with 6 having features suggestive of chronic osteomyelitis, including polyclonal plasma cells, necrosis, and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. For this study, these biopsies were evaluated by an independent surgical pathologist (N.W.). Re-review showed 7 of the 13 cases were consistent with osteoporotic VCF healing in various stages with adjacent trilineage hematopoiesis. Six of 13 (46%), were read as containing fragmented bony spicules, fibrotic and fatty marrow, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, and aggregates of mature, polyclonal plasma cells, suggesting the possibility of chronic osteomyelitis. However, at average follow-up of 37 months (range, 21-57 months), no patient demonstrated clinical and/or laboratory evidence of infection. Additionally, biopsies from 4 patients confirmed suspected or unsuspected malignancy, or confirmed no recurrence of malignant disease. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing first-time vertebral augmentation should be considered for vertebral biopsy. Tissue examination is useful and may reveal pathologic fracture or possible infection. However, if infection is reported, clinical and laboratory correlation are important to make a diagnosis of osteomyelitis.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate conservative and percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PV is an elective alternative to conservative management for the treatment of a painful osteoporotic vertebral fracture. METHODS: We performed a prospective study consisting of 101 consecutive patients who underwent PV and 27 patients who refused PV treatment and were managed conservatively. We used a data evaluation and outcomes system that was developed to evaluate the outcomes of surgical intervention. RESULTS: Patients that elected for PV as a treatment of their fractures had significantly more pain and functional impairment before the procedure than the patients of the conservative group (P < 0.001). The pain, functional, and general health scores of the PV group were improved from the preoperative mean values (P < 0.001) in all postoperative periods. Compared with the conservative treatment group, there was a significant difference at month 3. However, no statistical differences on function were observed between these groups at 6 months and 1 year posttreatment.

OBJECTIVE.: To determine the factors affecting the outcome of percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of persistent painful osteoporotic fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is an efficient procedure to treat pain due to osteoporotic vertebral fracture. However, the patient population that is most likely to benefit from this procedure is uncertain, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for an ideal candidate have varied widely in the literature. METHODS: A retrospective review of 278 percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures for osteoporotic fractures at 423 levels was performed. Sociodemographic, clinical, radiologic, and procedural data were analyzed as parameters for prognosis significance by univariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression to estimate the strength of influence of each variable. RESULTS: The presence of two or less symptomatic vertebrae (P < 0.03), the American Society of Anesthesiologists status I (P < 0.001), the presence of signal changes on magnetic resonance imaging (P < 0001), and the collapse of the vertebral body less than 70% (P < 0.001) were assessed as parameters for prognostic significance. Multivariate analysis also showed a significant correlation between the American Society of Anesthesiologists score and height loss of the vertebral body and the final outcome. The presence of signal changes on magnetic resonance imaging showed the highest odds ratio adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate patient selection is essential for achieving clinical success. Better results can be expected in patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of I and when the level managed is confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and the vertebral body height loss is less than 70%.",eng,1.0

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive group of patients undergoing PTPV at our institution between April 1998 and January 2001. Outcome measures included analgesic requirements, ambulatory status, sleep comfort, and overall quality of life 2 weeks after the procedure. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients (73 women and 24 men) underwent 258 PTPV procedures during 133 treatment sessions. The mean age was 76 years (range, 42-99 yr). The mean duration of follow-up was 14.7 months (range, 2-35 mo). Most of the patients had osteoporotic compression fractures, although some had osteolytic malignancies. Complete follow-up was obtained in 81 patients (84%). Narcotic and analgesic usage decreased in 63% of patients, increased in 7%, and remained the same in 30%. Ambulation and mobility were improved in 51%, worse in 1% and the same in 48%. One-half of the patients were able to sleep more comfortably after the procedure, whereas the other half remained the same. Most patients who reported no change in sleep or ambulation had experienced no impairment of these activities before PTPV. Overall, 74% of patients believed that PTPV significantly enhanced their quality of life and 26% reported no change. No patient was worse after PTPV. One patient with preexisting pneumonia died of respiratory failure after the procedure; another died of an acute stroke weeks later. One patient developed symptomatic pulmonary embolism of cement, and another developed transient quadriceps weakness from radiculopathy. Other complications were minor and infrequent. There were no infections. CONCLUSION: PTPV provided significant relief in a high percentage of patients with refractory pain.

Journal Article,A. P. Amar; D. W. Larsen; G. P. Teitelbaum,2003.0,Use of a screw-syringe injector for cement delivery during kyphoplasty: technical report,", ","OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous kyphoplasty is postulated to have several advantages over percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures and is gaining increased popularity. However, cement delivery with the KyphX kit (Kyphon, Inc., Santa Clara, CA), the only commercially available device for percutaneous kyphoplasty, is relatively problematic. This kit uses a series of bone filler device"" (BFD) tubes. Each BFD must be loaded manually with cement, which is then injected into the kyphoplasty cavity by manually depressing an inner stylet. The high profile of the BFD cannulas and their stylets requires frequent repositioning of the image intensifier tube and table. Because each accommodates only a small volume, the BFDs must be exchanged frequently. This delivery method also places the operator's hands directly in the field of radiation. We sought to overcome these limitations. METHODS: Dissatisfied with the shortcomings of the BFDs, we substituted the EZflow screw-syringe injector (Parallax Medical, Mountain View, CA) we use to deliver cement during conventional percutaneous vertebroplasty. This amalgam of the KyphX kit and the screw-syringe injector has been used for kyphoplasty treatment of 26 thoracolumbar compression fractures in 17 patients. RESULTS: The screw-syringe injector allows controlled volumetric delivery of large boluses of high-viscosity cement without having to refill the reservoir. It minimizes radiation exposure and does not require repositioning of the x-ray tubes. It may theoretically allow decompression should cement extrusion occur. Also, it delivers cement to the interstices of bony trabeculae outside the kyphoplasty cavity, thus combining the mechanical benefits of percutaneous kyphoplasty and percutaneous vertebroplasty. CONCLUSION: The use of a screw-syringe injector has several merits over the customary means of cement delivery during kyphoplasty.""",eng,0.0

METHODS: Seven adult patients (five women, two men; mean age: 81 years) treated for vertebral compression fractures by percutaneous vertebroplasty had cement leakage into perivertebral soft tissues along the needle route. Immediately after vertebroplasty, the procedure of extraction was performed under computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy guidance: a Chiba needle was first inserted using the same route as the vertebroplasty until contact was obtained with the cement fragment. This needle was then used as a guide for an 11-gauge Trocar t'am (Thiebaud, France). After needle withdrawal, a 13-gauge endoscopy clamp was inserted through the cannula to extract the cement fragments. The whole procedure was performed under local anesthesia.

The two most popular operative treatments of compression wedge fractures are vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, however, which method leads to restoration of normal spinal loading is unknown. METHODS: A cadaveric thoracolumbar spine model was fractured and then treated using one of two techniques: vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Three non-destructive loading regimes were applied to the intact, fractured and treated cases. Sub-adjacent nuclear pressure, used as a measure of anterior column loading, was determined for each experimental variant and loading case. FINDINGS: The data indicate that nuclear pressure was substantially reduced after the spine was fractured. These pressures were minimally increased after treatment, however, not to the level of the pre-fractured condition. In all loading cases, there were no significant differences between the two treatment types. INTERPRETATION: While our data show that both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty allow the disc to generate higher nuclear pressures, neither treatment increased nucleus pulposus pressure above the level of the intact state. This directly relates to the clinical condition in that adjacent segment fractures sustained subsequent to either treatment is likely the result of overall disease progression, and not a direct result of the intervention.",eng,0.0

The purpose of our study is to compare the efficacy and safety of vertebroplasty against conservative management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures without neurologic symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 66 patients with recent OVF on MRI examination were included in the study. All patients were admitted from September 2009 to September 2012. The cohort was divided into two groups. The first study group consisted of 33 prospectively followed consecutive patients who suffered 40 vertebral osteoporotic fractures treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty (group 1), and the control group consisted of 33 patients who suffered 41 vertebral osteoporotic fractures treated conservatively because they refused vertebroplasty (group 2). The data collection has been conducted in a prospective registration manner. The inclusion criteria consisted of painful OVF matched with imagistic findings. We assessed the results of pain relief and minimal sagittal area of the vertebral body on the axial CT scan at presentation, after the intervention, at six and 12 months after initial presentation. RESULTS: Vertebroplasty with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was performed in 30 patients on 39 VBs, including four thoracic vertebras, 27 vertebras of the thoracolumbar jonction and eight lumbar vertebras. Group 2 included 30 patients with 39 OVFs (four thoracic vertebras, 23 vertebras of the thoracolumbar junction and 11 lumbar vertebras). There was no significant difference in VAS scores before treatment (p = 0.229). The mean VAS was 5.90 in Group 1 and 6.28 in Group 2 before the treatment. Mean VAS after vertebroplasty was 0.85 in Group 1. The mean VAS at six months was 0.92 in Group 1 and 3.00 in Group 2 (p < 0.05). The mean VAS at 12 months was 0.92 in Group 1 and 2.36 in Group 2. The mean improvement rate in VAS scores was 84.40% and 62.42%, respectively (p < 0.05). For Group 1, mean area of the VBs measured on sagital CT images was 8.288 at the initial presentation, 8.554 postoperatively, 8.541 at five months and 8.508 at 12 months, respectively, and 8.388 at the initial presentation, 7.976 at six months and 7.585 at 12 months for Group 2 (Fig. 4). DISCUSSIONS: Although conservative treatment is fundamental and achieves good symptom control, in patients who suffer osteoporotic compression fractures (OCF), the incidence of late collapse is high and the prognosis is poor. In order to relieve the pain and avoid VB collapse, vertebroplasty is the recommended treatment in OCFs. Considering the above findings, the dilemma is whether vertebroplasty can change the natural history (pain and deformity) of OCFs. CONCLUSION: In our study on OVF, vertebroplasty delivered superior clinical and radiological outcomes over the first year from intervention when compared to conservative treatment of patients with osteoporotic compression fractures without neurological deficit. We believe that the possibility of evolution towards progressive kyphosis is sufficient to justify prophylactic and therapeutic intervention such as vertebroplasty, a minor gesture compared with extensive correction surgery and stabilization.",eng,1.0

Schober,2015.0,Radiofrequency sacroplasty (RFS) for the treatment of osteoporotic insufficiency fractures,10.1007/s00586-014-3638-7,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: In elderly patients with reduced bone quality, insufficiency fractures of the sacrum are relatively common and are typically accompanied by severe, disabling pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of cement augmentation by RFS, as well as to determine postinterventional leakages and present the patients' outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In 20 patients (18 women, 2 men) with an average age of 80.4 (65-92) years, a fracture of the sacrum was detected by CT and MRI. Clinically manifest osteoporosis with QCT values of below 50 mg/ml was found in all patients. An initially performed conservative treatment over a period of 3 weeks did not achieve a satisfactory reduction in the severe, disabling pain. The cement augmentation was performed under CT guidance by means of RFS under intubation anaesthesia. A Jamshidi needle was advanced into the respective fracture zone in the sacrum from dorsal to ventral (short axis) or from lateral to medial transiliac (transiliac axis). After removing the inner needle, a flexible osteotome was inserted through the positioned hollow needle and used to extend the spongious space in the fracture zone and thus prepare a cavity for the cement filling. The highly viscous polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) cement, activated by radiofrequency, was then inserted into the prepared fracture zone through a substituted screw cannula. Cement filling was performed discontinuously under instrumental guidance at 1.3 ml/min under CT guidance. Cement leakages were determined in CT images and conventional X-rays on the day after the intervention. Pain was documented on a visual analogue scale (VAS) on the day before the intervention, on the second day, and after 6 and 12 months after the intervention. Additionally occurring complications were recorded, and the patients were asked to state how satisfied they were after 12 months. RESULTS: RFS was technically feasible in all patients. In the control CT scans and X-rays, sufficient cement distribution and interlocking with vital bone was found along the course of the fracture in the sacrum. 7.2 (4-9) ml of cement were inserted per fracture. Leakage could be ruled out. The mean pain score on the VAS was 8.8 +/- 1.2 before the intervention, and a significant reduction in pain (p < 0.001) was seen on the second postoperative day, with an average value of 2.3 +/- 0.7, which was stable at 2.2 +/- 1.3 after 6 months and 2.1 +/- 1.1 after 12 months. All of the patients could be fully re-mobilised and discharged back home. A high level of patient satisfaction was found after 12 months, with 18 of the 20 patients stating that they would undergo the intervention again. One patient died of a stroke, another of cancer over the course. CONCLUSION: As a minimally invasive procedure, RFS is an effective and safe method of treatment for rapid, significant and sustained pain reduction.",eng,1.0

Schober,2012.0,[Interventional pain relief using balloon-kyphoplasty in patients with osteoporotic-based fatigue fractures of the os sacrum],10.1055/s-0031-1281782,"PURPOSE: In older patients with reduced bone quality, fatigue fractures of the os sacrum are relatively common and are typically accompanied by strong, disabling pain. The aim of our study was to verify the feasibility and safety of sacroplasty using a balloon catheter as well as the reduction of pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 25 patients were diagnosed with an os sacrum fracture in MRI. As a manifestation of an extant bone reconstruction process, all patients were diagnosed with distinctive edema on the basis of MRI strong T 2-weighted images. CT-controlled balloon sacroplasty was performed in all patients. To allow the cement to be dispensed at a longitudinal angle to the fracture, the balloon catheter is directed through a hollow needle in the os sacrum either from the caudal to the cranial direction or from the craniodorsal to the caudoventral direction. The thus created cavity was then filled with PMMA cement. A control CT and a conventional X-ray in two planes were then carried out. The pain intensity was defined by means of VAS before the intervention, on the second day, and 6 and 12 months after the intervention. RESULTS: The balloon sacroplasty yielded good technical performance in every patient. The control CT and the X-ray control of the os sacrum showed adequate distribution of the cement, and cement leakage was not detected. Before the operation, the average pain encountered was in accordance with VAS 8.3. On the second postoperative day, a considerable reduction with an average of 2.7 was reported, and this remained stable with an average of 2.5 after 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSION: Balloon sacroplasty is an effective treatment method for fast pain relief in patients with fatigue fractures of the os sacrum.",ger,0.0

Kasperk,2013.0,Criteria for the appropriate treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures,", ","BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF) necessitates a tailored approach of balancing the benefits and limitations of available treatments. Current guidelines are divergent, sometimes contradictory, and often insufficiently detailed to guide practice decisions. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at establishing treatment recommendations at the patient-specific level. STUDY DESIGN: Using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM), the appropriateness of different treatment options for osteoporotic VCFs was assessed. SETTING: The assessment was conducted by a European multidisciplinary panel of 12 experts. METHODS: The appropriateness of non-surgical management (NSM), vertebroplasty (VP), and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) was determined for 128 hypothetical patient profiles. These were unique combinations of clinical factors considered relevant to treatment choice (time since fracture, MRI findings, impact and evolution of symptoms, spinal deformity, ongoing fracture process, and pulmonary dysfunction). After 2 individual rating rounds and plenary meetings, appropriateness statements (appropriate, inappropriate, and uncertain) were calculated for all clinical scenarios. RESULTS: Disagreement dropped from 31% in the first round to 7% in the second round. Appropriateness outcomes showed specific patterns for the 3 treatments. For three-quarters of the profiles, only one treatment was considered appropriate: NSM 25%, VP 6%, and BKP 45%. NSM was usually appropriate in patients with a negative MRI or a positive MRI without other unfavorable conditions (poor outcomes for the other variables). VP was usually appropriate in patients with a positive MRI, time since fracture >/= 6 weeks, and no spinal deformity. BKP was recommended for all patients with an ongoing fracture process, and also in most patients with a positive MRI and >/= 1 other unfavorable factor. LIMITATIONS: The prevalence of the patient profiles in daily practice is yet unknown. CONCLUSION: The panel results may help to support treatment choice in the heterogeneous population of patients with osteoporotic VCF.",eng,0.0

Regge,2005.0,Treatment of painful compression vertebral fractures with vertebroplasty: results and complications,", ","AIM: The aim of this paper is to assess the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients with focal pain caused by compression vertebral body fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over an eleven-month period 49 patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty, of which seven were retreated, for a total of 56 operations on 108 vertebrae. The patients were affected by osteoporotic compression fractures (n=28) or by benign and malignant infiltrative processes (n=21). All of the patients were examined at discharge and later at one week, and one, three, six and nine months after surgery to ascertain the development of the pain and possible changes in the quality of life. The mean length of follow-up was 3.8 months. RESULTS: One week after treatment all patients reported complete disappearance or significant alleviation of the pain. In 8 out of 49 patients (16.3%) there was a reoccurrence of pain; 7 of these patients underwent further treatment at another level with immediate pain relief. After surgery only three patients (6.1%) continued to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), whereas prior to surgery all patients were taking pain medication. We also observed an important benefit in the quality of life, in that after treatment all patients reported an improvement in functional abilities, and only three (6.1%) still had to wear a back brace (against 15 in the preoperative period). We only had one serious complication (1.7%) which involved the formation of a subcutaneous paravertebral haematoma, which was resolved in about a week. Eight patients (16.3%) developed transient pain at the site of the puncture or radiculopathy in the days following the operation. In 63 out of 108 of the treated vertebrae (58) there were small asymptomatic leakages of cement outside the vertebral body and in two asymptomatic patients (3.5%) the chest radiograph revealed a small pulmonary embolism of cement. DISCUSSION: Our experience confirms the effectiveness of vertebroplasty in the treatment of pain caused by vertebral fractures. If the indications are respected the improvement of symptoms is often immediate, such as the return of mobility, and patient satisfaction with surgery is higher. The use of appropriate guiding systems limits the number of complications.","eng

MATERIALS AND METHODS: PV was performed in 1,634 patients (1,387 women; median age 73 years +/- 9.3) with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). All patients had back pain that persisted for >/= 2 months with a concordant magnetic resonance imaging study. After PV, medical therapy for osteoporosis was continued, and patients were prospectively evaluated (follow-up 11.8-44.9 months, mean 25.0 months). Visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), analgesic drug use, and use of external brace support were recorded at baseline and during follow-up. New occurrences of symptomatic vertebral fractures were recorded. RESULTS: The mean VAS score of 7.94 significantly improved to 1.12 at the primary endpoint (P < .001). Differences in patterns of analgesic usage compared with baseline values were highly statistically significant (marginal homogeneity test, P < .001).

According to the declaration of Helsinki, 22 women (60-80 years; mean, 75 years) with painful osteoporotic vertebral collapse underwent bilateral transpedicular PV on 22 lumbar vertebrae. Two 10-G vertebroplasty needles were introduced into the vertebra under digital fluoroscopy; a 16-G radiofrequency thermoablation needle (Starburst XL; RITA Medical System Inc., USA), carrying five thermocouples, was than coaxially inserted. Eleven different bone cements were injected and temperatures were measured every 30 s until temperatures dropped under 45 degrees C. After the thermocouple needle was withdrawn, bilateral PV was completed with cement injection through the vertebroplasty needle. Unpaired Student's t-tests, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to evaluate significant differences (p < 0.05) in peak temperatures, variations between cements, and clinical outcome. All procedures were completed without complications, achieving good clinical outcomes (p < 0.0001). Regarding average peak temperature, cements were divided into three groups: A (over 60 degrees C), B (from 50 degrees to 60 degrees C), and C (below 50 degrees C). Peak temperature in Group A (86.7 +/- 10.7 degrees C) was significantly higher (p = 0.0172) than that in Groups B (60.5 +/- 3.7 degrees C) and C (44.8 +/- 2.6 degrees C). The average of all thermocouples showed an extremely significant difference (p = 0.0002) between groups. None of the tested cements maintained a temperature >or=45 degrees C for more than 30 min. These data suggest that back-pain improvement is obtained not by thermal necrosis but by mechanical consolidation only. The relative necrotic thermal effect in vertebral metastases seems to confirm that analgesia must be considered the main intent of PV.""",eng,0.0

Although this procedure was demonstrated to be effective in osteoporosis and metastases, few studies have been reported in cases of multiple myeloma (MM). We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of PV in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) resulting from MM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PV was performed in 106 consecutive MM patients who had back pain due to VCFs, the treatment of which had failed conservative therapies. Follow-up (28.2 +/- 12.1 months) was evaluated at 7 and 15 days as well as at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and every 6 months after PV. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, opioid use, external brace support, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score were recorded.
RESULTS: The median pretreatment VAS score of 9 (range 4-10) significantly (P < 0.001) decreased to 1 (range 0-9) after PV.

Montemurro,2013.0,Percutaneous vertebral augmentation assisted by PEEK implant in painful osteolytic vertebral metastasis involving the vertebral wall: experience on 40 patients,", ","BACKGROUND: Vertebral metastases are associated with significant pain, disability, and morbidity. Open surgery for fracture stabilization is often inappropriate in this cancer population due to a poor risk-benefit profile, particularly if life expectancy is short. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are appealing adjunctive procedures in patients with malignancy for alleviation of intractable pain. However, these patients have a higher risk of serious complications, notably cement extravasation. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively evaluated clinical results of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implant (Kiva) assisted vertebroplasty performed in malignant painful osteolytic lesions at risk for cement extravasation due to vertebral wall involvement. SETTING: Department of Interventional Radiology, Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment, Candiolo, Turin, Italy METHODS: Forty patients (22 women; mean age 66.8 +/- 12.4), suffering from a painful spine malignancy with vertebral wall involvement not responding to conventional therapies and without surgical indications, underwent vertebral augmentation with Kiva intravertebral implant for pain palliation. The procedure was performed with moderate sedation and local anesthesia under combined digital fluoroscopy and computed tomography guidance. After the coil-shaped PEEK implant was deployed within the vertebral lesion, bone cement was injected under continuous digital fluoroscopic control. Patients were discharged from the hospital the next procedural day. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), analgesic requirement, and use of external brace support were evaluated to determine efficacy. The primary end-point was safety and efficacy at one month after the procedure. However, all the patients were scheduled to be followed-up at month 3, 6, and every 6 months thereafter. Follow-up was prospectively evaluated in all patients after Kiva with clinical interviews. The Institution's Internal Review Board approved this study. RESULTS: Median pre-treatment VAS of 10 (range 6 - 10) significantly (P < 0.001) dropped to one (range 0 - 3), with all patients achieving a clinically relevant benefit on pain at one month. Differences in pre- and post-treatment analgesic therapy were significant (P < 0.001). All patients no longer use an external brace after Kiva. In 7 out of 43 (16.3%) treated vertebrae a bone cement leakage was detected. LIMITATIONS: This is a not randomized study. Participants were limited to 40 patients. CONCLUSION: The Kiva System potentially represents a novel and effective minimally invasive treatment option for patients suffering from severe pain due to osteolytic vertebral metastases.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Follow-up was obtained in 4547 patients (3211 females and 1336 males; mean age 70.2 years) that underwent PV for a total of 13.437 treated vertebrae. Procedures were performed by using fluoroscopic guidance or combined CT-fluoroscopic guidance. All patients underwent PV in local anaesthesia except for second cervical vertebrae treated with a trans-oral approach that required general anaesthesia. RESULTS: 4004 out of 4547 (88.0%) patients reported significant pain relief (difference>or=2 point in pain evaluated with an 11-point visual analogue scale; p<0.0001) within 48 h: an average of 7.7 +/- 0.4 dropped to 1.8 +/- 0.6 in the osteoporotic patients; 8.3 +/- 0.4 to 2.4 +/- 0.4 in metastases; 8.3 +/- 0.4 to 1.7 +/- 1.0 in myeloma; 6.2 +/- 3.5 to 0.3 +/- 0.2 in angioma and 7.4 +/- 0.4 to 1.4 +/- 0.9 in trauma. 430 osteoporotic patients (13%) were retreated for a subsequent fracture; in 302/430 patients (70.2%), the new fracture occurred in the contiguous vertebra. No major neurologic complications were reported and the most frequent minor complication was venous leakage (20.5%).

PV has been used effectively for pain relief in osteoporotic and malignant vertebral fractures. Cement extrusion is a common problem and can lead to complications. Sixty patients (52 female; mean age, 72.2 +/- 7.2) suffering from osteoporosis (46), malignancy (12), and angiomas (2), divided into two groups (A and B), underwent PV on 190 vertebrae (86 dorsal, 104 lumbar). In Group A, PV with high-viscosity PMMA (Confidence, Disc-O-Tech, Israel) was used. This PMMA was injected by a proprietary delivery system, a hydraulic saline-filled screw injector. In Group B, a standard low-viscosity PMMA was used. Postprocedural CT was carried out to detect PMMA leakages and complications. Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank test were used to assess significant differences (p < 0.05) in leakages and to evaluate the clinical outcome. PV was feasible, achieving good clinical outcome (p < 0.0001) without major complications. In Group A, postprocedural CT showed an asymptomatic leak in the venous structures of 8 of 98 (8.2%) treated vertebrae; a discoidal leak occurred in 6 of 98 (6.1%). In Group B, a venous leak was seen in 38 of 92 (41.3%) and a discoidal leak in 12 of 92 (13.0%). Reduction of venous leak obtained by high-viscosity PMMA was highly significant (p < 0.0001), whereas this result was not significant (p = 0.14) related to the disc.

Suitability depends largely on fracture age, with acute osteoporotic fractures being most appropriate. Selection and planning usually involves either Tc MDP scintigraphy or MRI. There is evidence indicating that either modality is predictive of response to vertebroplasty, but there is limited evidence promoting their combined use. AIM: The aim of the study was to establish the degree of concordance between MRI and Tc MDP scintigraphy in vertebral fracture assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our institution routinely uses both MRI and Tc MDP scintigraphy in vertebroplasty planning. This retrospective analysis included 39 patients, with a total of 73 vertebral fractures, all treated with vertebroplasty. The fractures were classified according to fracture age, aetiology and intermodality concordance. RESULTS: The overall concordance between MRI and Tc MDP scintigraphy was 63%. Almost twice as many fractures classified as 'acute/ subacute' on MRI were so classified on Tc MDP scintigraphy. CONCLUSION: Using MRI without Tc MDP scintigraphy, 48.2% of the potentially suitable vertebroplasty targets (37% of the total vertebral lesions) would likely have been overlooked. Clearly, Tc MDP scintigraphy and MRI provide different but complementary information on vertebral fractures, and these results support the use of dual-modality assessment in vertebroplasty selection and planning.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,F. Aparisi,2016.0,Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty in Vertebral Osteoporotic Fractures,10.1055/s-0036-1592431,"Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive treatments and indispensable tools in the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures. This method of treatment is performed using fluoroscopy or a scanner control an access via the pedicle or the posterolateral angle of the vertebral body. Vertebroplasty requires a smaller caliber needle than kyphoplasty, so it is technically easier. Vertebroplasty uses high-pressure injection, whereas in kyphoplasty the injection is held at low pressure, which together with the effect of compression on the bone that the balloon produces reduces the risk and rate of cement leakage. Vertebroplasty is effective in managing osteoporotic compression vertebral fractures, with improvement in pain and quality of life in the immediate postoperative period and over the medium term.Both techniques have a very low complication rate. There is no consensus on whether the emergence of new fractures in the cases treated by vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are related to mechanical variations that were introduced or is a complication related to the age and evolution of the patient's osteoporosis. Even with this risk of new fractures, the improvement in quality of life obtained after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty treatment is worthwhile. The benefits outweigh the risks.",eng,0.0

We believe percutaneous vertebroplasty can be performed safely and efficaciously in individuals without radicular symptoms who present with canal compromise, with or without cord compression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed all vertebroplasties performed at our institution over the past 4 years. Cases in which vertebroplasty was performed at levels showing complete effacement of the epidural space, particularly those with cord compression, were included in the review. Follow-up data obtained from questionnaires routinely sent to our vertebroplasty patients were used to evaluate symptomatic response in this subset of patients as well as the occurrence of any complications. RESULTS: Of 686 levels treated over the past 4 years, 26 levels in 23 patients qualified for our review. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 2 years. Patients were asked to rate the degree of their original pain as follows: gone, better than, the same as, or worse than before the procedure. Of the 23 patients, five (22%) reported complete resolution of pain, 15 (65%) reported their symptoms to be better, and three (13%) reported no appreciable change. No complications with clinical sequelae were encountered.

Previous tests on prophylactic vertebroplasties have been performed under axial loading, while in vivo changes in spinal alignment likely cause off-axis loads. In this study we determined whether prophylactic vertebroplasty can also reduce the fracture risk under off-axis loads. In a previous study, we tested vertebral bodies that were loaded axially or 20 degrees off-axis representing vertebrae in an unfractured spine or vertebrae adjacent to a wedge fracture, respectively. In the current study, vertebral failure load and stiffness of our previously tested vertebral bodies were compared to those of a new group of vertebral bodies that were filled with bone cement and then loaded 20 degrees off-axis. These vertebral bodies represented adjacent-level vertebrae with prophylactic bone cement filling. Prophylactic augmentation resulted in failure loads that were comparable to those of the 0 degrees group, and 32% greater than the failure loads of the 20 degrees group. The stiffness of the prophylacticly augmented vertebrae was 21% lower than that of the 0 degrees group, but 27% higher than that of the 20 degrees group. We conclude that prophylactic augmentation can decrease the fracture risk in a malaligned, osteoporotic vertebra.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect that off-axis vertebral loading has on the stiffness and failure load of vertebrae. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Adjacent level vertebral fractures not only are common in patients who received a vertebroplasty treatment but also occur in patients with conservatively treated wedge fractures. The wedge-like deformity, which is present in both groups, changes the spinal alignment. The load of vertebrae adjacent to the fractured vertebra will change from perpendicular to the endplate to a more shearing, off-axis, load. This change may induce a higher fracture risk for vertebrae adjacent to wedge-like deformed vertebrae. METHODS: Twenty vertebrae, harvested from one osteopenic cadaver spine and three osteoporotic cadaver spines, were loaded until failure. The vertebrae were loaded either perpendicular to the upper endplate, representing vertebrae in a spine without wedge fractures (0 degrees group, n = 10), or at an angle of 20 degrees , representing vertebrae adjacent to a wedge fracture (20 degrees groups, n = 10). Vertebral failure load and stiffness were the most important outcome measures. RESULTS: The failure load was significantly higher (P 5 0.028) when tested at 0 degrees (2854 N, SD 5 622 N), compared with vertebrae tested at 20 degrees (2162 N, SD 5 670 N). Vertebrae were also significantly stiffer (P, 0.001) when tested at 0 degrees (4017 N/mm, SD 5 970 N/mm) than those tested at 20 degrees (2478 N/mm, SD 5 453 N/mm). CONCLUSION: The failure load of osteopenic/osteoporotic vertebrae was 24% lower under off-axis loads (20 degrees ) than under axial loads (0 degrees ). This study may lead to a better understanding of the etiology of adjacent vertebral fractures after wedge-like deformities and demonstrates the importance of height reconstruction of wedge fractures in order to normalize the loading conditions on adjacent vertebrae.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) with a clinically relevant amount of bone cement is capable of causing stress peaks in adjacent-level vertebrae. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: It is often suggested that PVP of a primary spinal fracture causes stress peaks in adjacent vertebrae, thereby leading to additional fractures. The in vitro studies that demonstrated this relationship, however, use bigger volumes of bone cement used clinically. METHODS: Ten fresh-frozen vertebrae were loaded until failure, while registering force and displacement as well as the pressure under the lower endplate. After failure, the vertebrae were augmented with clinically relevant amounts of bone cement and then again loaded until failure. The force, displacement, and pressure under the lower endplate were again registered. RESULTS: Stress peaks were not related to the location of the injected bone cement. Both failure load and stiffness were significantly lower after augmentation. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our findings, we conclude that vertebral augmentation with clinically relevant amounts of bone cement does not lead to stress peaks under the endplate. It is therefore unlikely that PVP, in itself, causes detrimental stresses in the adjacent vertebrae, leading to new vertebral fractures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.",eng,1.0

We emphasize the possibility of extending the use of kyphoplasty to non-osteoporotic vertebral fractures, and combining this method with traditional posterior fusion procedures. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2005, 138 patients suffering from thoraco-lumbar acute fractures, were treated in our Department. 87 corresponded to one vertebral level fractures; 34 to two levels, and the remaining 17 patients had more than two vertebrae affected. 65 patients (47%) received conservative therapy (rest in bed, physiotherapy, and subsequent progressive mobilization with cast). The remaining ones (73 cases; 43%) were treated invasively, performing balloon vertebroplasty alone (n=25), or kyphoplasty associated to posterior fusion in 15 cases (11%). Different kinds of screw posterior fusions were performed in the remaining patients (n=33; 24%). The latter group was not included in the present study. In the conservatively treated group (CTG), seven patients (11%) had a bad outcome, showing a persistency of hyperintensity in MRI-T2 sequences of the vertebral body, suggesting local edema. Mean hospitalization rate was 29 days in CTG. None of the 40 patients treated with kyphoplasty alone or combined with fusion showed abnormalities in neurological examination. They were classified in two groups: Group a"": Kyphoplasty alone (n=25). Mean of sagittal index in this group was 11 degrees (range: 6 degrees -15 degrees). In 9 patients, vertebral body collapse exceeded 25%. Mean hospitalization rate was 14 days. ""Group b"": Kyphoplasty and posterior fusion techniques (n=15): Mean sagittal index was 23 degrees (range: 13 degrees - 40 degrees). All the patients presented with a vertebral body collapse superior to 25%. All of them had posterior body wall involvement. This group was treated by surgery (decompression and fusion) and open vertebral body kyphoplasty. Mean hospitalization rate was 35 days. Clinical results of these 40 patients were measured by means of work status, restriction of physical activities and analgesic drug intake. Except for four patients of ""Group b"", 36 returned to their work. In 11 cases a slight reduction of physical activity was registered. Average ""Group a"" follow-up was 47 months (range: 10-72 months). A mean kyphosis correction of 5,3 degrees (sagittal index) was reached in this group. Average ""Group b"" follow-up was 26 months (range: 9-54). Mean kyphosis correction was 10,3 degrees . As for complications, we registered three balloon disruptions and five leakages into the disc. CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty could constitute an alternative and/or complementary treatment of traditional spinal stabilization-fusion procedures in non osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Therefore, it should be offered, when indicated, as a substantial possible part of the treatment, to the patients suffering from vertebral fractures. Additional advantages of combining kyphoplasty and posterior fusion are the possibility of reducing the number of fused levels (shorter instrumentations), and to perform a 360 degree stabilization-remodeling through a single posterior approach.""",spa,0.0

Minimally invasive surgical procedures such as the kyphoplasty allows patients with pathological osteolytic vertebral lesions to have immediate improvement in their quality of life. This surgical technique provides in myeloma vertebral collapses same quick pain relief as in osteoporotic vertebral fractures, and a minor morphological restoration of the interested vertebra, but sufficient to restore sagittal alignment.

The technique is very effective for achieving rapid pain relief, restoring bone height,and consequent vertebral realignment,and thus stabilization of the vertebra. METHODS: We reviewed 57 patients with vertebral compression fractures. All patients were neurologically intact and presented with severe low back pain or localized pain over the thoracolumbar region. Indications for kyphoplasty were osteoporotic and traumatic compression fractures, osteolytic tumor metastases, and aggressive hemangiomas without spinal canal compression. RESULTS: In 57 patients, 77 levels were treated. Follow-up was 6.5 months. Patients were evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS) preoperatively and postoperatively. The mean preoperative VAS score was 91.08 for pain, whereas the mean postoperative VAS score was 11.22. Percentage of mean pain relief was 87.9% during the first 6 months of follow-up. We achieved a 43.6% improvement in the height of the compressed VB and 6.3 degrees of improvement in the kyphotic angle. No serious complications occurred. Mean hospital stay was 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty carries significantly less morbidity than vertebroplasty or open surgery. Risk for embolization is low. Normal kyphotic angle can be restored or improved by this technique. In the hands of experienced surgeons, kyphoplasty is a safe and a minimally invasive technique for patients with neoplastic, traumatic, or osteoporotic lesions of the vertebra or sacrum.",eng,0.0

Senkoylu,2016.0,Comparison of effectiveness of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in patients with osteoporotic vertebra fractures,10.1016/j.aott.2016.10.002,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the functional and radiological outcomes of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in patients with osteoporotic vertebra fractures. METHODS: The files of the patients who underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebrae fractures were retrieved from the archives. Forty-three patients with complete follow-up data were included in the study group. The patients were evaluated for radiological outcomes in terms of local kyphosis angle, wedging index, compression ratio, visual analog pain scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). RESULTS: In the study group, kyphoplasty was performed on 24 vertebrae of 22 patients (17 females, 5 males; mean age: 73 years) whereas vertebroplasty was applied on 24 vertebrae of 21 (16 females, 5 males; mean age: 74.7 years) patients. The mean follow-up time was 26 months. When the VAS and ODI values of the groups were analyzed, both groups showed statistically significant progress after the operation. Radiological data showed that the kyphoplasty group showed statistically significant improvement in the sagittal index values whereas the vertebroplasty group did not. The overall complication ratio was 4%. CONCLUSION: Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are effective treatment methods for functional recovery and pain relief in osteoporotic fractures of the vertebra. Although radiological outcomes of the kyphoplasty seem to be better, this does not have any clinical relevance. We suggest vertebroplasty over kyphoplasty since it is an easier method to manage.

The resulting reduction in bone strength leads to the well recognized increase in the risk of fracture, particularly at the radius, hip, and spine. The treatment of osteoporotic fractures is challenged by the reduced mechanical capacity of osteoporotic bone, reflected in reduced holding power and increased fragility. The aim of successful fracture treatment in individuals with osteoporosis is early fixation of the fracture with immediate and almost unrestricted weight-bearing capacity. The key factor for effective fracture treatment is strict adherence to the basic principles of stable fracture fixation: reposition, compression, long, wide supports, as well as additive techniques such as angular stability and bone augmentation. Modern osteosynthesis implants effectively support the application of these principles. Modifications in implant design and techniques enable the surgeon to apply and combine the essential components of the basic principles for the treatment of mechanically impaired bone. The key components employed in modern implants include integrated compression techniques, multidirectional angular stability, expandable support surfaces, as well as multiple augmentation options. However, despite modern implant technology, osteoporotic bone fractures remain a significant challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon and require meticulous planning and implementation of the basic principles.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of neoplastic tissue migration into lungs during vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The application of vertebroplasty in spinal metastasis is not well documented. The risk of neoplastic tissue migration into the lungs during vertebroplasty remains unknown. METHODS: A cancer model was built in 11 Landrace pigs (50 kg) by injecting 99mTc-labeled albumin macroaggregates into the center of L5 and L6 prior to vertebroplasty. Continuous scintigraphic imaging was performed with 1-minute frames over the lungs and vertebrae before and after injection to ensure steady state and baseline. We surveyed free TcO4- in thyroid. Twenty minutes after the 99mTc injection, 2-level vertebroplasty was performed at L5 and L6 with 3 Jamshidi needles in each vertebra. Into each vertebra, on average, 2.8 +/- 1.1 mL of poly(methyl methacrylate) cement (Depuy CMW, Blackpool, UK) was injected. Quantitative scintigrams were obtained within 90 minutes after vertebroplasty. X-rays and quantitative computed tomography scans quantified cement distribution. Means of 99mTc activity before and after vertebroplasty were compared in a paired t test. RESULTS: In this cancer model, we found an 80% risk of tissue migration to the lungs when performing vertebroplasty. In average, the study showed a significant amount of macroaggregate migration of 1.87% total range from 0% to 8% (CI: 0.05%-0.37%) with P = 0.045. There was no free TcO4- in the thyroid. Despite the standardized procedure, we found a large interindividual variation of pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that there exists a significant risk of exporting neoplastic disease or fatty tissue to the lungs when performing vertebroplasty. A similar adverse effect can be expected with balloon kyphoplasty. In patients with metastatic disease, vertebroplasty should be limited to those with short life expectancy.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To present the early clinical results of pedicle screw fixation augmented by vertebroplasty using polymethylmethacrylate in severely osteoporotic patients requiring spine surgery due to the neurologic deficit. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: It is postulated that combining a formal vertebroplasty-that is, maximum filling of the trabecular space with polymethylmethacrylate-with pedicle screw placement in osteoporotic vertebrae could result in resistance to pullout forces significantly. METHODS: Between the years 2003 and 2006, pedicle screw placement with vertebroplasty augmentation was performed in 49 patients who had severe osteoporosis and who required spine surgery due to neurologic deficit. Eleven patients with less than 2 years of follow-up and 2 patients who died from unrelated illness were excluded from the study. Thirty-six of 49 patients having minimum 2 years of follow-up were included. Cement augmentation was also performed in segments proximal and distal to instrumentation to prevent junctional segment fractures. Early and late postoperative complications were recorded during follow-up. RESULTS: The mean postoperative follow-up was 37 (24 to 48) months. The average age of the patients was 66 (59 to 78) years. The instrumentation was performed meanly at 5 segments and vertebroplasty was performed averagely at 7 segments. All patients had the T-score value of less than -2.5 from the anteroposterior and lateral lumbar spine and hip views, so regarded as severe osteoporosis. In our study group, there were no extravasation and subsequent thermal neural injury. Four superficial wound infections have been observed and they responded well to local debridement and antibiotics. There were no proximal and distal junctional segment fractures during the follow-up course. Postoperatively, all patients with neurologic symptoms had complete relief of their nerve compression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In patients requiring spine surgery due to neurologic deficit and having no sufficient time for the medical treatment of severe osteoporosis, pedicle screw fixation with vertebroplasty augmentation and vertebroplasty in segments proximal and distal to the instrumented segments can be good alternative methods to provide well fixation and fusion while preventing proximal and distal junctional fractures.

So far, the mechanical competence has been determined immediately post-treatment, without considering long-term effects of bone adaptation. In this work, we investigated such long-term effects of vertebroplasty on the stiffness of the augmented bone by means of computational simulation of bone adaptation. Using micro-finite element analysis, we determined sites of increased mechanical stress (stress raisers) and stress shielding and, based on the simulations, regions with increased or decreased bone loss due to augmentation. Cement volumes connecting the end plates led to increased stress shielding and bone loss. The increased stiffness due to the augmentation, however, remained constant over the simulation time of 30 years. If the intervention was performed at an earlier time point, it did lead to more bone loss, but again, it did not affect long-term stability as this loss was compensated by bone gains in other areas. In particular, around the augmentation cement, bone structures were preserved, suggesting a long-term integration of the cement in the augmented bone. We conclude that, from a biomechanical perspective, the impact of vertebroplasty on the bone at the microstructural level is less detrimental than previously thought.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of a new, nonresorbable bioactive composite (Cortoss) compared with PMMA, the standard treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty with PMMA, the widely adopted treatment for VCFs nonresponsive to conservative care, provides effective, immediate pain relief, but the material has received criticism for its properties. A new bioactive composite material designed specifically for vertebroplasty showed promising results in animals and nonrandomized clinical studies and was subsequently compared with PMMA in a randomized study. This study represents the first prospective study evaluating vertebroplasty comparing PMMA with another material with 24-month follow-up. METHODS: Using 2:1 randomization, vertebroplasty was performed with Cortoss on 162 patients and PMMA on 94 patients. Inclusion criteria were painful osteoporotic VCFs with a visual analogue scale pain score of at least 50 mm on a 100-mm scale and at least 30% disability as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index. Evaluations at pretreatment, treatment day, and 7 posttreatment intervals out to 24 months included pain, disability, neurological status, adverse events, quality of life, patient satisfaction, analgesic use, and independently reviewed radiographs. RESULTS: Noninferiority of Cortoss relative to PMMA was observed, with Cortoss-treated patients experiencing significant pain relief at 3 months (P = 0.0395) and better maintenance or improvement in function at 24 months (P = 0.0299). Incidence of serious device-related adverse events was 4.3% in both groups; none were life threatening. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty using either Cortoss or PMMA provides effective, immediate, and lasting pain relief and prevents further loss of function.

Twenty patients were treated at 3 centers, using vertebroplasty (VP) and 20 patients were treated at 5 centers, using kyphoplasty (KP). OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and clinical outcomes using Cortoss to treat osteoporotic VCF. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cortoss is an injectable bioactive, self-setting, radiopaque composite shown to stabilize and provide immediate weight bearing support to fractured vertebrae. Cortoss is approved for use in Europe for both screw and vertebral augmentation. METHODS.: Patient assessments were conducted before surgery and after surgery through 24 months using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and quality-of-life assessment (SF-12) questionnaires. Extravasations were evaluated using radiographs and CT scans. RESULTS: Immediate pain improvement was seen in VP patients with VAS scores decreasing from 75.7 before surgery to 35.9 at 72 hours. Continued improvement from baseline was seen out to 2 years (average VAS of 48.9). Disability improved with average ODI scores decreasing from 52.2% preoperative to 38.3% at 2 years for VP patients. Immediate pain improvement was also seen in KP patients with VAS scores decreasing from 78.1 before surgery to 42.7 at 72 hours. Continued improvement from baseline was seen out to 2 years (average VAS of 25.4). ODI scores improved from 60.5% preoperative to 34.5% at 2 years for KP patients. Average material volumes injected were 1.85 mL for VP and 4.13 mL for KP. Extravasations from both techniques were minor, anatomically close to the treated vertebrae and asymptomatic. No cardiac irregularities or pulmonary emboli were observed. CONCLUSION: These studies indicate Cortoss is safe and effective in treating osteoporotic VCF using vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty.

METHODS: We investigated medical records and radiologic images of patients undergoing percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture between October 2009 and September 2014. We assessed patients' age, past medical history, and bone mineral content using computed tomography. Procedure-specific outcomes were assessed, including ratio of injected bone cement to vertebral body volume, bone cement distribution in the vertebral body (to identify degree of consistency in bone cement injection), presence of bone cement leakage into adjacent disc space, segmental kyphosis, and time interval between first and second fracture events. RESULTS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed in 293 patients (60 men and 233 women) with 336 affected levels. Of this cohort, 34 (14.6%) patients sustained SNVCFs. We compared patients in 2 groups: patients who experienced SNVCFs, and patients who did not experience fractures. Significant differences were identified in bone mineral content (P = 0.000) and bone cement distribution (P = 0.000). Patients exhibiting bone cement leakage into disc space revealed a higher incidence of SNVCF than patients without leakage (P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Poor bone mineral content can be a predictive factor of SNVCFs. To prevent SNVCFs, bone cement should be injected as evenly as possible into the vertebral body. Bone cement leakage into the disc space should be avoided.",eng,1.0

In metastatic compression fracture (MCF), cancer often invades the paravertebral structure and involves the posterior column of the vertebrae. PURPOSE: In the present study, we first analyzed how clinical features of MCF affect functional outcomes after VP. Second, we evaluated whether BKP is more beneficial than simple VP (SVP) in MCF. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a retrospective observational study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Three hundred forty-two patients who underwent VP for painful MCF from solid cancer were included. We excluded MCF from hematopoietic cancer, such as leukemia or multiple myeloma. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain improvement was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS; range: 0-10), and if the VAS score decreased by at least three points the treatment was considered effective. Postoperative change in Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and drug requirement for pain control were also measured as functional outcomes. METHODS: An institutional database at the National Cancer Center of Korea was searched to identify all patients who underwent VP for painful MCF between March 2002 and September 2013. Demographic data, as well as preoperative and postoperative clinical factors, were collected from patients' medical records. Radiological features, including paravertebral extension of tumors and the extent of three-column involvement, were reviewed from pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs). These clinical and radiological factors were then analyzed for their influence on functional outcomes. RESULTS: The mean preoperative VAS score was 5.8; this improved to a mean of 2.7 after VP. Effective improvement in VAS score (>/=3) was achieved in 206 patients (60%). Patients with radiculopathy, as well as those with involvement of (1) the posterior column or (2) more than four out of six columns, presented with significantly higher pretreatment VAS scores and experienced more effective improvement after treatment (p<.05). Two hundred thirty-eight patients (70%) underwent SVP, whereas the remaining 104 patients underwent BKP. The pretreatment degree of compression was significantly higher in BKP (mean: 47%) than in SVP patients (mean: 30%) (p<.001). However, preoperative VAS scores were not significantly different between the two groups, and the resultant VAS score improvement was also not significantly different. Although BKP patients reported to have a greater chance of more than 3 mL of cement injection (p=.01), the mean amount of cement injected was not different between the two groups. Patients with other bone metastases showed a significantly poorer KPS improvement rate (p=.015). Patients having moderately or slowly growing cancer according to the Tomita classification had a greater chance of reduced drug requirements 1 month after the procedure (p=.004). CONCLUSIONS: Paravertebral extension and posterior column involvement of MCF did not preclude pain improvement after VP. Balloon kyphoplasty for MCF failed to show enhanced pain improvement relative to SVP. Metastatic compression fracture patients with other bone metastases or rapidly growing tumors had a lower chance of performance improvement and reduced drug requirements, respectively.",eng,1.0

The most important factors for AVFs are the degree of osteoporosis and altered biomechanics due to the spinopelvic imbalance in the fractured area of the spine. INTRODUCTION: We intend to evaluate the relationship between sagittal spinopelvic parameters and the occurrence of adjacent vertebral fractures following the initial compression fracture and to determine the possible dominant risk factor associated with new compression fractures. METHODS: From March 2010 to May 2012, 240 consecutive patients with painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) were enrolled in a retrospective study. Ninety-one patients with VCFs underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) at 112 levels. The sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence (PI), and segmental kyphotic angle on sagittal standing radiographs were used to evaluate radiologic outcomes. RESULTS: In 2 years, 15 out of 134 patients (11.1%) treated with conservative treatment, and 12 out of 91 patients (13.1%) treated with VP sustained adjacent level fracture. More patients with the BMD higher or equal to 3.0 experienced a new fracture than those with a BMD less than 3.0 (p = 0.019), and the risk for adjacent level fractures decreased significantly when segmental kyphotic angle was less than 11 degrees (p = 0.001), SVA was less than 6 cm (p = 0.001), SS was higher or equal to 25 degrees (p = 0.004), and LL was higher or equal to 25 degrees (p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: The most important factors for new VCFs after the initial compression fractures are the degree of osteoporosis and altered biomechanics due to the spinopelvic imbalance in the fractured area of the spine. Regarding the spinopelvic alignment to investigate the relationship with a subsequent AVF, segmental kyphotic angle, SS, LL, and SVA may be a potential predictor.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the histologic changes of rhBMP-2/CPC in vertebroplasty and determine the feasibility of this bone substitution instead of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have shown that the new rhBMP-2/nanoscale CPC has a suitable strength and injection for vertebroplasty. However, the osteoinductive properties and biodegradable characteristics are still unclear. METHODS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was performed in 4 adult rhesus monkeys of 2 groups. Ten vertebral bodies (VBs) from T10-L7 of each rhesus were selected, and the 20 VBs in each group were randomly divided into 3 subgroups. Subgroup A (rhBMP-2/CPC): 8 VBs, filled with rhBMP-2/CPC; Subgroup B (PMMA): 6 VBs, filled with injectable PMMA; Subgroup C (control): 6 VBs, filled with normal saline. The 2 rhesus monkeys from each of the groups were killed at 2 and 6 months after operation, respectively. Individual specimens from the 40 VBs were collected for histologic observation. RESULTS: In subgroup A, radiographic and histologic observations showed that the part of the rhBMP-2/CPC cement degraded with new bone and new vessel ingrowths, into the material, after 2 months. In addition, gaps, fibrous hyperplasia, or sclerotic callus were not found in the interface. After 6 months, the cement was nearly all replaced by mature bone tissue. In subgroup B, the inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrous membrane gapping were found after 2 months, and subsided partly at 6 months. But no new bone formation and material degradation were discovered. In subgroup C, the tunnels were filled with irregular new trabeculae after 2 months and unrecognizable from the surrounding mature bone after 6 months. CONCLUSION: It is confirmed that the rhBMP-2/CPC is an osteoinductive and biodegradable material (in animal trials).

METHODS: The study comprised 83 patients who presented with complaints of OVF associated with osteoporosis and were treated with CT (37) or PV (46). All patients were evaluated according to preoperative and postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and plain radiographs. RESULTS: All patients in VP group reported a significant decrease in pain at 1st day postoperative. While Pain relief and functional outcomes were significantly better in PV group than CT at 1st and 3rd months according to VAS and ODI scores, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups at 6th months follow-up. The mean preoperative local sagittal Cobb angle (LSCA) and the mean vertebra corpus mid-level height (MVCH) were 42.3 degrees and 14.6 mm in the PV group, while they were measured as 39.8 degrees and 15.7 mm in CT group, respectively. 15.6 degrees decreasing the LSCA and 10.2 mm increasing MVCH were noted in the PV group at the 6th month follow-up. While LSCA increased 19.1 degrees and MVCH decreased 7.6mm in CT group at same time period (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the CT group, PV provides a rapid decrease of pain and an early return to daily life activities. Although improvement was observed on the radiological findings following treatment in the PV group, PV may not enhance the quality of life in patients with acute OVF at 6th months follow up.",eng,1.0

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Ovid MEDLINE was searched from January 1966 to December2006 for all English-language papers on vertebroplasty. The quality of evidence in these papers was graded according to the 4-point classification system of evidence-based medicine. Level II evidence currently supports use of vertebroplasty.
MAIN MESSAGE: Vertebroplasty alleviates pain from vertebral compression fractures that result from osteoporosis, hemangiomas, malignancies, and vertebral osteonecrosis. Vertebroplasty has provided substantial pain relief in 60% to 100% of patients; has decreasedanalgesic use in 34% to 91% of patients; and has improved physical mobility in 29% to 100% of patients. Contraindications to vertebroplasty include asymptomatic compression fractures of the vertebral body, vertebra plana, retropulsed bone fragments or tumours, active infection, uncorrectable coagulopathy, allergy to the bone cement or opacification agent, severe cardiopulmonary disease, pregnancy, and pre-existing radiculopathy. The short-term complication rate was found to be 0.5% to 54%. Rare but serious complications include compression of the spinal cord or nerve root, infection, cement embolization causing pulmonary infarct and clinical symptoms, paradoxical embolization of the cerebral artery, and severe hematomas.
CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty is a safe and effective treatment for vertebral fractures that cannot be treated using conservative measures. [References: 19]",English,0.0

Rufenacht,2002.0,"[Percutaneous vertebroplasty: methods, indications, results]",", ","Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a radiologically guided therapeutic procedure, which consists of percutaneous injection of a liquid polymer (bone cement) into a destroyed vertebral body. PVP was invented in 1984, in France, first for treating vertebral body haemangioma. Since its introduction the indications have been expanded progressively and today PVP is indicated mainly for treatment of vertebral haemangioma, malignant vertebral tumor and osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. The unique advantage of this technique is that besides the stabilization of the vertebral body--and partly in connection with this--it affords prompt and lasting pain relief. Based on published data the success rate of the procedure is 80-100% with a complication rate of 1-10%. Thus, PVP is a valuable minimally invasive tool, providing immediate pain relief and early mobility in carefully selected patients. However, further work is needed to define the benefits of PVP compared to the standard treatment. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the technique by analyzing scientific reports published to date and summarizing the first author's own experience gained at the University Hospital of Geneva, Department of Neuroradiology, Switzerland.",hun,0.0

A clinical and imaging follow-up designed to identify the early (especially pulmonary embolism of bone cement) and late complications of the technique is proposed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: On the basis of the current guidelines, 101 patients were selected: 64 osteoporotic and 37 neoplastic. A total of 173 vertebrae were treated. Procedures were performed with both computed tomography and fluoroscopic guidance. Residual pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale score immediately after vertebroplasty and 1, 15, 30, 90, 180 and 270 days later. Spine and chest radiographs were obtained 24 h after vertebroplasty; spine radiography was repeated 30 days later. RESULTS: Therapeutic success was obtained in 88% of osteoporotic patients and in 84% of neoplastic patients. Pulmonary cement emboli were identified in four patients, all of whom were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of osteoporotic and neoplastic vertebral fractures. Clinical and imaging followup allows effective patient monitoring and early detection of possible complications.","eng

Postoperative biomechanics of vertebroplasty,10.1016/j.jbspin.2005.02.004,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the biomechanisms underlying adjacent fractures following vertebroplasty, an emerging procedure to stabilize fractured vertebrae. In this procedure, bone cement is injected percutaneously into the vertebral cancellous bone. Once hardened, the cement offers mechanical reinforcement to the weakened vertebra. Recent clinical and biomechanical reports suggest that this procedure may cause new fractures adjacent to the one augmented. The cause and extend is unclear yet. The focus here is on the biomechanical hypothesis resulting from the rigid cement augmentation. METHODS: A combination of experimental and numerical studies, in additional to a review of recent clinical reports. RESULTS: The broader finding suggests that vertebroplasty changes the mechanical loading in adjacent vertebrae. Specifically, an increase in adjacent loading in the range of 17% has been found. The mechanism underlying this increase seemed to stem from the excessive cement rigidity that reduced the endplate bulge of the augmented vertebra, thereby reducing the local spinal joint flexibility. The reduction in joint flexibility seeks to reverse itself by creating an increase in the inter-vertebral disc pressure. The increased disc pressure seeks to relieve itself by increasing the load on the adjacent vertebra. The increased load on the adjacent vertebra relates directly to an increased risk of fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Although an increasing amount of evidence exists to support this theory of the origin of adjacent fractures, one must be cautious. Vertebroplasty is a relatively new procedure and further observations and, ultimately, prospective clinical studies are required to conclusively determine the cause and extend of adjacent fractures.",eng,0.0

Vertebroplasty, where acrylic or calcium phosphate cement is injected into the weakened vertebrae to augment them, is an emerging procedure for treating spinal fragility fractures. However, cement injection is currently limited because there are no clear standards for a safe, reproducible and predictable procedure. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role that bone cements play in the underlying bio-mechanisms that affect the outcomes of cement injection. Our most important finding after combining clinical, laboratory and theoretical research is that the process of cement injection poses conflicting demands on bone cements. The cements are required to be more viscous and less viscous at the same time. The challenge therefore is to develop biomaterials, techniques and/or devices that can overcome or manage the conflicting demands on cement viscosity.",eng,0.0

Short-term clinical and biomechanical results are encouraging; however, so far no reports on long-term results have been published. Our clinical observations suggest that vertebroplasty may induce subsequent fractures in the vertebrae adjacent to the ones augmented. At this point, there is only a limited understanding of what causes these fractures. We have previously hypothesized that adjacent fractures may result from a shift in stiffness and load following rigid augmentation. The purpose of this study is to determine the load shift in a lumbar motion segment following vertebroplasty. A finite-element (FE) model of a lumbar motion segment (L4-L5) was used to quantify and compare the pre- and post-augmentation stiffness and loading (load shift) of the intervertebral (IV) disc adjacent to the augmented vertebra in response to quasi-static compression. The results showed that the rigid cement augmentation underneath the endplates acted as an upright pillar that severely reduced the inward bulge of the endplates of the augmented vertebra. The bulge of the augmented endplate was reduced to 7% of its value before the augmentation, resulting in a stiffening of the IV joint by approximately 17%, and of the whole motion segment by approximately 11%. The IV pressure accordingly increased by approximately 19%, and the inward bulge of the endplate adjacent to the one augmented (L4 inferior) increased considerably, by approximately 17%. This increase of up to 17% in the inward bulge of the endplate adjacent to the one augmented may be the cause of the adjacent fractures.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: 1) To measure the intravertebral shell pressure and injection pressure; and 2) to determine the effect of the vertebral shell on the intravertebral shell pressure and on the injection pressure. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Forces that govern cement flow are an essential component of the cement injection process in vertebroplasty. The vertebral shell may play a significant role in confining the flow of cement in the vertebral body and thereby affecting the intravertebral pressure and injection pressure. METHODS: A small fenestration was created in the left lateral vertebral shell of 14 vertebrae. A valve to open and close the fenestration and a sensor to measure the intravertebral pressure were attached to the opening. A closed fenestration simulated an intact shell, whereas an open fenestration represented a vented shell. Injection pressure and intravertebral pressure at the shell were recorded during a controlled injection. RESULTS: A closed fenestration resulted in a significant increase in the intravertebral pressure at the shell. During the injection, the shell pressure increased on average to approximately 3.54 +/- 2.91 kPa. Conversely, an open fenestration resulted in an instant relaxation of the shell pressure to the ambient pressure of 0 kPa. Additionally, the injection pressure was approximately 97 times higher than the shell pressure. CONCLUSION: The presence of vertebral shell seems to be important for intravertebral pressure. However, the intravertebral shell pressure adds very little to the injection pressure.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,G. Baroud; C. Vant; R. Wilcox,2006.0,Long-term effects of vertebroplasty: adjacent vertebral fractures,", ","In today's aging population, osteoporosis-related fractures are an ever-growing concern. Vertebroplasty, a promising yet cost-effective treatment for vertebral compression fractures, has an increasing role. The first vertebroplasty procedures were reported by Deramond and Galibert in France in 1987, and international interest grew with continued development of clinical techniques and augmentation materials in Europe and the United States. Initial publications and presentations at peer review meetings demonstrated 60-90% success rates in providing immediate and significant pain relief. The objective of this review is to assemble experimental and computational biomechanical research whose goal is determining and preventing the negative long-term effects ofvertebroplasty, with a specific focus on adjacent vertebral fractures. Biomechanical studies using isolated cancellous bone cylinders have shown that osteoporotic cancellous bone samples augmented by the rigid bone cement were at least 12 times stiffer and 35 times stronger than the untreated osteoporotic cancellous bone samples. The biomechanical efficacy of the procedure to repair the fractured vertebrae and prevent further collapse is determined using single-vertebra models. The strength or load-bearing capacity of a single vertebra is significantly increased following augmentation when compared to the intact strength. However, there is no dear result regarding the overall stiffness of the single vertebra, with studies reporting contradictorily that the stiffness increases, decreases, or does not significantly alter following augmentation. The effects of vertebroplasty on adjacent structures are studied via multisegment models, whose results plainly oppose the findings of the single-vertebra and intravertebral models. Here, augmentation was shown to decrease the overall segment strength by 19% when compared to the matched controls. As well, there is a significant increase in disc pressure compared to the pre-augmentation measurements. This translates to a high hydrostatic pressure adjacent to the augmented vertebra, representing the first evidence of increased loading. Computational finite element (FE) models have found that the rigid cement augmentation results in an increase in loading in the structures adjacent to the augmented vertebra. The mechanism of the increase of the loading is predicted to be the pillar effect of the rigid cement. The cement inhibits the normal endplate bulge into the augmented vertebra and thus pressurizes the adjacent disc, which subsequently increases the loading of the untreated vertebra. The mechanism for adjacent vertebral fractures is still unclear, but from experimental and computational studies, it appears that the change in mechanical loading following augmentation is responsible. The pillar effect of injected cement is hypothesized to decrease the endplate bulge in the augmented vertebra causing an increase in adjacent disc pressure that is communicated to the adjacent vertebra. To confirm the viability of the pillar effect as the responsible mechanism, endplate bulge and disc pressure should be directly measured before and after augmentation. Future studies should be concerned with quantifying the current and ideal mechanical response of the spine and subsequently developing cements that can achieve this optimum response.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: To present initial results regarding pain relief, spinal stabilization, and complications after treatment with percutaneous vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty was developed in France in the late 1980s. Several European reports have described excellent results for treatment of compression fractures and neoplasms. The procedure was not performed in the United States until 1994. Only a single series of 29 patients treated in the United States has been reported. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 47 consecutive patients with 84 vertebrae treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty. Thirty-eight patients with 70 vertebrae had symptomatic, osteoporotic fractures and had failed medical therapy. Eight patients with 13 vertebrae had primary or metastatic neoplasms. One patient had a hemangioma. Immediate and long-term pain response, spinal stability, and complications were evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 38 patients treated for osteoporotic fractures, 24 (63%) had marked to complete pain relief, 12 (32%) moderate relief and 2 (5%) no significant change. Only 4 of the 8 patients with malignancies had significant pain relief. In 7 of these patients, no further vertebral compression occurred, and spinal canal compromise was prevented. The patient with the hemangioma had no significant pain reduction. Minor complications occurred in 3 (6%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty provided significant pain relief in a high percentage of patients with osteoporotic fractures. The procedure provided spinal stabilization in patients with malignancies but did not produce consistent pain relief. Complications were minor and infrequent. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a promising therapy for patients with osteoporotic fractures and for selected vertebral column neoplasms.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To assess radiation exposure time during robot-guided vertebral body augmentation compared with other published findings. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Rising incidence of vertebral compression fractures in the aging population result in widespread use of vertebral body cement augmentation with significant radiation exposure to the surgeon, operating room staff, and patient. Radiation exposure leads to higher cancer rates among orthopedic and spine surgeons and patients. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with 60 vertebral compression fractures underwent robot-guided vertebral body augmentation performed by 2 surgeons simultaneously injecting cement at 2 levels under pulsed fluoroscopy. The age of patients was in the range from 29 to 92 (mean, 67 yr). One to 6 vertebrae were augmented per case (average 2). Twenty-five patients had osteoporotic fractures and 8 had pathological fractures. Robotic guidance data included execution rate, accuracy of guidance, total surgical time, and time required for robotic guidance. Radiation-related data included the average preoperative computed tomographic effective dose, radiation time for calibration, registration, placement of Kirschner wires, and total procedure radiation time. Radiation time per level and surgeon's exposure were calculated. RESULTS: Kyphoplasty was performed in 15 patients (1 sacroplasty), vertebroplasty in 13, and intravertebral expanding implants in 5. The average preoperative computed tomographic effective dose was 50 mSv (18-81). Average operative time was 118 minutes (49-350). Mean robotic guidance took 36 minutes. Average operative radiation time was 46.1 seconds per level (33-160). Average exposure time of the surgeons and the operating room staff per augmented level was 37.6 seconds. The execution rate was 99%, with an accuracy of 99%. Two complications (hemothorax and superficial wound infection) occurred. CONCLUSION: The radiation exposure of the surgeon and the operating room staff in a series of robot-assisted vertebral body augmentation was 74% lower than published results on fluoroscopy guidance and approximately 50% lower than the literature on navigated augmentation.

Usefulness of a delayed cement injection,10.1007/s00256-011-1114-6,"AIM: The goal of this study was to specifically address the incidence of dorsal leakage when performing vertebroplasty in patients with posterior wall osteolysis or fracture, by using a delayed injection of cement with the aim of increasing its viscosity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively reviewed the records of 24 patients (13 women, 11 men; age range 42-67 years; mean age 54.7) with diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) who underwent 34 vertebroplasties between January 2007 and January 2010 for painful osteolytic localization of MM with dorsal cortical osteolysis or fracture. All vertebroplasties were performed with an 8 min delay, which was half of the allotted injecting time given for the chosen cement. In 11 cases there were fractures involving the posterior wall, in 1 case with dorsal fragment dislocation, and in 33 cases there was dorsal cortical osteolysis. All of the patients showed no response to standard treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and analgesic treatments. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all cases. In 20 patients, we treated only one high-risk vertebral lesion, in six patients we treated two segments, and in one patient we treated three segments. All patients experienced improvement in symptoms after the procedure as demonstrated by improved visual analogue scores (VAS) and performance status (PS) and decreased doses of analgesic. There was a dorsal leakage in 2/34 (5.8%) treated vertebral bodies in which an epidural space tumor extension was also diagnosed, without increasing neurological symptoms after the intervention. CONCLUSION: From these results vertebroplasty with delayed injection of cement is safe and effective in the treatment of vertebral localization of myeloma with osteolysis or fracture of the posterior vertebral wall.",eng,1.0

Anterior height restored postoperatively was 2.28 mm (95% CI, 1.49-3.08 mm; P < .001) and 2.78 mm (95% CI, 1.89-3.66 mm; P < .001) for CF and IBTF groups, representing ~35% and 39% of lost height restored, but group differences were not significant (P = .4). Intraoperative anterior height gain attributed to dynamic mobility was 2.96 mm (95% CI, 1.92-4.00 mm; P < .001) and 3.05 mm (95% CI, 2.10-4.00 mm; P < .001); additional height attributed to IBT inflation was 1.09 mm (95% CI, 0.77-1.41 mm; P < .001) and 1.25 mm (95% CI, 0.68-1.82 mm; P < .001), representing a 37% and 41% increase. There was no significant height loss on IBT removal and cementation. Both groups had improved pain and ambulation. Asymptomatic leakage occurred in 15% of VCFs. There was 1 nonserious device-related hematoma (IBTF group). One new clinical VCF occurred in each group, but they were not device-related.
CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques resulted in significant vertebral body height and pain improvement. Procedure and adverse event data demonstrated safe curette use in conjunction with balloon kyphoplasty procedures.",English,0.0

CASE REPORT: A 50-year-old female patient with an osteoporotic compression fracture of the second lumbar vertebra underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty with polymethylmetaacrylate. Thereafter, CT scanning revealed small asymptomatic cement emboli in peripheral pulmonary arteries, along with a hook-shaped cement fragment in the inferior vena cava. Due to the risk that the large cement fragment could migrate to the pulmonary arteries and cause serious complications, they were retrieved from the inferior vena cava by an endovascular technique and extracted through a surgical groin incision. The patient received anticoagulant treatment for 3 months and is free of complaints after 1 year.

They can cause significant pain and disability in the elderly population and until recently, the mainstay of treatment has been analgesia and physical therapy. We undertook a review of the literature looking at the outcome with various operative techniques currently used in the treatment of SIF. A thorough literature search was undertaken to identify the various techniques used in the surgical treatment of SIF and their outcome. Keywords used included sacroplasty, SIF and cement augmentation. We analysed the number of cases presented, surgical technique, follow-up and clinical outcome. The techniques described include sacroplasty (injection of cement into fractured sacrum) and augmented iliosacral (trans-sacral) screws. Fifteen papers were published in the English literature between 2002 and 2008. No Level I, II or III evidence was available. In total, 108 patients were included. Computerised tomography combined with fluoroscopy was the most common image guidance technique used (80 patients). Where documented, there was significant improvement in mean visual analogue score (VAS) from 8.9 to 2.6 (P < 0.001, paired Student's t test). In conclusion, cement augmentation techniques such as sacroplasty with or without iliosacral screw fixation can produce significant improvements in VAS scores. They appear to be a suitable alternative to analgesia and rehabilitation. However, more robust evidence is required to validate these promising early results with cement augmentation techniques.",eng,0.0

INTRODUCTION: Clinical evidence on the effect of teriparatide in patients with prior fracture is limited. In the DANCE observational study, the incidence of nonvertebral fragility fractures (NVFX) decreased significantly in patients receiving teriparatide for >6 months (6-24 months) versus >0 to </=6 months (reference period). METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis to assess the effect of teriparatide 20 mug/day in patients who entered DANCE with prior vertebral or hip fractures. The incidence of patients experiencing a NVFX for four 6-month intervals during and after treatment was compared with the reference period. RESULTS: Overall, 4085 patients received >/=1 dose of teriparatide. Of 3720 with sufficient data for efficacy analysis, 692 had prior vertebral fracture, including 179 with previous kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty; 290 had prior hip fracture. These patients were older, and those with prior vertebral fractures had more comorbid conditions at baseline than those without prior vertebral fractures. The incidence of patients experiencing NVFX declined over time in all patient groups. The fracture incidence rate declined 49 and 46%, respectively, in patients with and without prior vertebral fracture and was 63 and 46% lower in patients with previous kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty and without prior vertebral fracture. NVFX declined 43 and 48% in patients with and without prior hip fracture. The reduced incidence over time was consistent in the subgroups (all interaction p values >0.05). Patients with prior fracture were more likely to experience serious adverse events.

Hornberger,2015.0,Economic Analysis of Kiva VCF Treatment System Compared to Balloon Kyphoplasty Using Randomized Kiva Safety and Effectiveness Trial (KAST) Data,", ","BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are the most common osteoporotic fractures and cause persistent pain, kyphotic deformity, weight loss, depression, reduced quality of life, and even death. Current surgical approaches for the treatment of VCF include vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BK). The Kiva(R) VCF Treatment System (Kiva System) is a next-generation alternative surgical intervention in which a percutaneously introduced nitinol Osteo Coil guidewire is advanced through a deployment cannula and subsequently a PEEK Implant is implanted incrementally and fully coiled in the vertebral body. The Kiva System's effectiveness for the treatment of VCF has been evaluated in a large randomized controlled trial, the Kiva Safety and Effectiveness Trial (KAST). The Kiva System was non-inferior to BK with respect to pain reduction (70.8% vs. 71.8% in Visual Analogue Scale) and physical function restoration (38.1 % vs. 42.2% reduction in Oswestry Disability Index) while using less bone cement. The economic impact of the Kiva system has yet to be analyzed. OBJECTIVE: To analyze hospital resource use and costs of the Kiva System over 2 years for the treatment of VCF compared to BK. SETTING: A representative US hospital. STUDY DESIGN: Economic analysis of the KAST randomized trial, focusing on hospital resource use and costs. METHODS: The analysis was conducted from a hospital perspective and utilized clinical data from KAST as well as unit-cost data from the published literature. The cost of initial VCF surgery, reoperation cost, device market cost, and other medical costs were compared between the Kiva System and BK. The relative risk reduction rate in adjacent-level fracture with Kiva [31.6% (95% CI: -22.5%, 61.9%)] demonstrated in KAST was used in this analysis. RESULTS: With 304 vertebral augmentation procedures performed in a representative U.S. hospital over 2 years, the Kiva System will produce a direct medical cost savings of $1,118 per patient and $280,876 per hospital. This cost saving with the Kiva System was attributable to 19 reduced adjacent-level fractures with the Kiva System. LIMITATIONS: This study does not compare the Kiva System with VP or any other non-surgical procedures for the treatment of VCF. CONCLUSION: This first-ever economic analysis of the KAST data showed that the Kiva System for vertebral augmentation is hospital resource and cost saving over BK in a hospital setting over 2 years. These savings are attributable to reduced risk of developing adjacent-level fractures with the Kiva System compared to BK.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,D. P. Beall; B. Parsons; S. Burner,2016.0,Technical Strategies and Anatomic Considerations for an Extrapedicular Modified Inferior Endplate Access to Thoracic and Lumbar Vertebral Bodies,", ","BACKGROUND: Percutaneous access to the vertebral bodies is commonly done via the transpedicular approach for both diagnoses and treatment of spinal pathology. While this approach is effective in most cases, it is difficult in certain situations such as a patient with obstructing hardware from prior surgery. OBJECTIVES: To investigate and illustrate an alternative to the typical percutaneous access to the vertebral body via an extrapedicular approach and to determine the complications associated with this approach. STUDY DESIGN: Description of a novel percutaneous vertebral body access technique developed during cadaver dissection and a report of complication rates in cases that were performed using this technique. SETTING: Radiology department at a private institution. METHODS: An effective extrapedicular access technique that could safely and consistently allow the needle tip to be placed in the center of the vertebral body was developed from cadaver dissection observations for the purpose of clinical use. A total of 96 vertebral compression fractures from T5 to L5 were treated via the extrapedicular technique at our institution between July 2008 and August 2012. There were 72 patients between ages 27 and 98 (mean age 73.2 years) who underwent treatment. RESULTS: Cadaver dissection revealed a relatively avascular and aneural portion of the inferior vertebral body just anterior to the pedicle. A total of 96 vertebral fractures were treated using the extrapedicular technique without any recognized clinical complications from the needle access or the instrumentation. LIMITATIONS: The trial included a relatively small sample size, representing 7.4 percent of total patients treated at our institution. This was likely the result of a smaller patient population with contraindications to typical transpedicular access. CONCLUSIONS: The thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies may be accessed using a percutaneous extrapedicular access technique which represents a relatively avascular and aneural approach to the vertebral body. The technique presented allows access to the vertebral body around existing hardware and can accommodate the placement of large instruments. This technique was not associated with any known complications in our series of patients.Key words: Vertebral body, spine, extrapedicular, kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty, paraspinal, thoracic, lumbar.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,J. Beaudreuil,2006.0,[Nonpharmacological treatments for osteoporosis],10.1016/j.annrmp.2006.05.004,"OBJECTIVES: Study the effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatments for osteoporosis. METHOD: Review and qualitative analysis of the literature concerning the effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatments: physical exercise, rehabilitation aiming to prevent falls, spinal orthosis, and vertebro- and kyphoplasty. RESULTS: The level of evidence of the effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatment is unequal on the basis of randomized study. The practice of physical exercise by the ambulatory elderly people and home rehabilitation for those who have previously fallen prevent the occurrence of falls. For institutionalized people, the prevention of falls is achieved by multidisciplinary programs. The use of hip protectors to prevent fracture is controversial. Physical exercises prevent bone loss after menopause and during postmenopausaul and corticosteroid osteoporosis. The effectiveness of mobilization after fracture is not documented. Only one study concerning the use of spinal orthosis after vertebral fracture reports interesting results for pain and disability. No randomized study concerning vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fracture is described. CONCLUSION: The nonpharmacological treatments of osteoporosis are considered therapeutic means of key importance. They aim at the prevention of falls and bone loss and the reduction of disability after fracture. Only physical exercise and rehabilitation have been shown to be effective in preventing falls or bone loss. Their ability to reduce the incidence of fractures remains to be evaluated.",fre,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of an intraoperative 3D imaging predicting trocar positions in osteoporotic fractured vertebral bodies before cement injection. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Malpositioned needles in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty increase the risk of extravertebral cement leakage and the associated complications. This study was intended to clarify whether the position of trocars can adequately be determined before the cement application by an intraoperative 3D imaging. METHODS: Between August 2006 and July 2008 the positions of 84 trocars in 42 fractured vertebrae between T11 and L5 were measured by intraoperative 3D imaging before injection of the cement. The external diameter of the needles was 9 to 10 G. The positions of the trocars were classified in the axial plane by a new classification system. RESULTS: Forty 3D scans covered 84 injection cannulae in 42 fractured vertebral bodies. The average duration of the entire scanning procedure was 7.1 minutes. All 3D scans could be evaluated with adequate degree of certainty. Intraoperative evaluation of the 3D scans showed 78 correct needle positions. Two trocars were in an acceptable lateral malposition. There were 4 medial malpositions that required revision. In total, 4.8% of the trocars were positioned not acceptably. Postoperative computed tomography was performed in 17 patients. The positions of 34 needles determined by computed tomography conformed 100% to the results of the 3D scans. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to reliably determine the position of trocars in vertebral bodies with the aid of an intraoperative 3D scan. This can lead to a reduction in the morbidity rates associated with puncture errors in kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. The amount of time required is small. The increased radiation exposure is acceptable.",eng,0.0

Some authors suggest the risk of refracture at adjacent vertebra will be reduced by prophylactic stabilization. We therefore compared the refracture rate after prophylactic balloon kyphoplasty in 60 patients randomized into groups with either monosegmental balloon kyphoplasty or adjacent prophylactic balloon kyphoplasty. The level (superior versus inferior) for prophylactic stabilization was chosen according to fracture type. We evaluated patients for 12 months using radiographs, visual analog scale scores, and SF-36 scores. We followed 23 of 30 patients in the monosegmental group and 27 of 30 patients in the prophylactic group. We observed no difference in the 1-year refracture rates between the two groups (five patients in the monosegmental group and seven in the prophylactic group). Leakage into the disc was the presumed cause of adjacent fractures in 50% of the patients. Disc leakage and refracture rate did not correlate as a result of the low patient number. Based on our data, we believe there is no indication for prophylactic stabilization of adjacent segments with balloon kyphoplasty.",eng,0.0

With balloon kyphoplasty, the injection of bone cement is preceded by inflation and removal of bone tamps (balloons) inside the fractured vertebral body. This allows for the creation of a void, where viscous cement is delivered resulting in a lower risk for cement leakage than with vertebroplasty. Another advantage of the balloon inflation is the potential to correct the deformity and restore sagittal alignment. The percutaneous techniques normally require intact pedicles and intact posterior elements. We found that modifying the technique made it suitable for the management of vertebra plana, traumatic fractures, and neoplasms.

The treatment focuses on pain control, maintenance of independence, and management of the osteoporosis. Elderly patients often encounter adverse effects to pain medications, do not tolerate bed rest, and are not ideal candidates for invasive spinal reconstructive surgery. Percutaneous vertebral augmentation (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) has become popular as a less-invasive alternative. However, studies have questioned the effectiveness of these procedures. METHODS: The authors conducted a MEDLINE search using relevant search terms including osteoporosis, osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, elderly, kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. CASE SUMMARY/RESULTS: Two elderly patients presented with a fracture of their third and first lumbar vertebral body, respectively. One patient progressed well with conservative treatment, whereas the other patient was hospitalized secondary to pain after conservative measures failed to offer improvement. The hospitalized patient subsequently opted for a kyphoplasty and was able to resume his normal daily activities after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Selecting patients on an individual case-by-case basis can optimize the effectiveness and outcomes of a vertebral augmentation. This process includes the documentation of an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with the aide of imaging studies, including the acuity of the fracture as well as the correlation with the physical examination findings. Patients who are functional and improving under a conservative regimen are not candidates for kyphoplasty. However, if the conservative management is not successful after 4 to 6 weeks and the patient is at risk to become bedridden, an augmentation should be considered. A kyphoplasty procedure may be preferred over vertebroplasty, given the lower risk profile and better outcomes regarding spinal alignment.",eng,0.0

Nowadays, it is indicated in a large number of processes and injuries. The aim of this article, in its 2 parts, is to review the current status of VATS in treatment of the thoracic and lumbar spine in its entire spectrum. DEVELOPMENT: After reviewing the current literature, we develop each of the large groups of indications where VATS is used, one by one. This first part contains a description of general thoracoscopic surgical technique including the necessary prerequisites, transdiaphragmatic approach, techniques and instrumentation used in spine reconstruction, as well as a review of treatment and specific techniques in the management of spinal fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracoscopic surgery is in many cases an alternative to conventional open surgery. The transdiaphragmatic approach has made endoscopic treatment of many thoracolumbar junction processes possible, thus widening the spectrum of therapeutic indications. These include the treatment of fractures and deformities, as well as the reconstruction of injured spinal segments and decompression of the spinal canal in any etiological processes if the lesion placement is favourable to antero-lateral approach. Good clinical results of thoracoscopic surgery are supported by the growing experience reflected in a large number of articles. The degree of complications in thoracoscopic surgery is comparable to open surgery, with benefits in morbidity of the approach and subsequent patient recovery.",spa,0.0

Ten spines were harvested from nonembalmed female cadavers (age 68.6 +/- 13.7 years) and evaluated for bone mineral density using the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry method (t-score = -2.3 +/- 2.4). The 50 VBs (L1-L5) were disarticulated, compressed in a materials testing machine to determine initial strength and stiffness, and then assigned to one of six groups. Two of these groups (n = 8, n = 9) concerned experimental cements, the results of which are not reported here. The 33 vertebral bodies in the remaining four groups were left untreated or were repaired using a transpedicular injection of one of three commercially available polymethylmethacrylate cements.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the strength and stiffness of osteoporotic vertebral bodies subjected to compression fractures and subsequently stabilized via bipedicular injection of one of two bone cements: one is a commercially available polymethylmethacrylate (Simplex P) and one is a proprietary glass-ceramic-reinforced BisGMA/BisEMA/TEGDMA matrix composite that is being developed for use in vertebroplasty (Orthocomp). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporotic compression fractures present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for the clinician. Vertebroplasty, a new technique for treating such fractures, stabilizes vertebral bodies by injection of cement. Little is known, however, about the biomechanics of this treatment. METHODS: Five vertebral bodies (L1-L5) from each of four fresh spines were harvested from female cadavers (age, 80 +/- 5 years), screened for bone density using DEXA (t = -3.4 to -6.4), disarticulated, and compressed in a materials testing machine to determine initial strength and stiffness. The fractures then were repaired using a transpedicular injection of either Orthocomp or Simplex P and recrushed. RESULTS: For both cement treatments, vertebral body strength after injection of cement was significantly greater than initial strength values. Vertebral bodies augmented with Orthocomp recovered their initial stiffness; however, vertebral bodies augmented with Simplex P were significantly less stiff than they were in their initial condition. CONCLUSIONS: Augmentation with Orthocomp results in similar or greater mechanical properties compared with Simplex P, but these biomechanical results have yet to be substantiated in clinical studies.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: To determine if the inflatable bone tamp (tamp) restores height to compressed vertebral bodies and to compare the biomechanical properties of isolated, fractured osteoporotic vertebral bodies treated by kyphoplasty (tamp) or vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous biomechanical studies have shown that vertebroplasty increases vertebral body strength and restores vertebral body stiffness, but does not restore vertebral body height lost as a result of compression fracture. METHODS: Compression fractures were experimentally created in 16 osteoporotic VBs assigned to either the tamp or percutaneous vertebroplasty group. The tamp treatment consisted of inserting balloon-like devices into the vertebral body, inflating the bone tamp, and filling the void with Simplex P (Howmedica, Rutherford, NJ) bone cement. The percutaneous vertebroplasty treatment consisted of directly injecting Cranioplastic bone cement (CMW, Blackpool, UK) into the vertebral body. Pre- and posttreatment heights were measured, and the repaired vertebral bodies were recompressed to determine posttreatment strength and stiffness values. RESULTS: The tamp treatment resulted in significant restoration (97%) of vertebral body height lost after compression, whereas percutaneous vertebroplasty treatment resulted in a significantly lower restoration of lost height (30%) (P < 0.05). Both treatments resulted in significantly stronger vertebral bodies relative to their initial state (P < 0.05). The tamp treatment restored vertebral body stiffness to initial values, but the percutaneous vertebroplasty treatment did not (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Tamp treatment resulted in significantly greater height restoration than did percutaneous vertebroplasty, without loss of vertebral body strength or stiffness.",eng,1.0

This comparative ex vivo biomechanical study was designed to determine the strength and stiffness of osteoporotic vertebral bodies (VBs) subjected to compression fractures and stabilized with bipedicular injections of Cranioplastic altered in a manner consistent with the practice of vertebroplasty or BoneSource cement.
METHODS: VBs T8-T10 and L2-L4 from 10 fresh spines were harvested from female cadavers (aged 91.5 years +/- 3.9 at death). These were screened for bone density (t score, -4.9 +/- 1.4; bone mineral density, 0.61 g/cm(2) +/- 0.19), disarticulated, and compressed to determine initial strength and stiffness. The fractured VBs were stabilized with bipedicular injections of a predetermined quantity and type of cement and then re-crushed.
RESULTS: At both the thoracic and lumbar levels, VBs repaired with altered Cranioplastic resulted in significantly greater strength (P <.05) than that in their prefracture states, whereas those repaired with BoneSource were restored to their initial strength. Cranioplastic resulted in significantly stronger repairs than BoneSource in the thoracic region; however, repair strengths in the lumbar region were not significantly different. The repaired stiffness was significantly lower than the initial stiffness in all treatments and in both regions. Differences in the repaired stiffness between the treatment groups in either region and differences in the mechanical parameters obtained by adding an additional 2 mL of BoneSource were not significant.

The effect of cement volume on mechanical behavior,", ","STUDY DESIGN: Ex vivo biomechanical study using osteoporotic cadaveric vertebral bodies. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between the volume of cement injected during percutaneous vertebroplasty and the restoration of strength and stiffness in osteoporotic vertebral bodies, two investigational cements were studied: Orthocomp (Orthovita, Malvern, PA) and Simplex 20 (Simplex P with 20% by weight barium sulfate content; Stryker-Howmedica-Osteonics, Rutherford, NJ). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous biomechanical studies have shown that injections of 8-10 mL of cement during vertebroplasty restore or increase vertebral body strength and stiffness; however, the dose-response association between cement volume and restoration of strength and stiffness is unknown. METHODS: Compression fractures were experimentally created in 144 vertebral bodies (T6-L5) obtained from 12 osteoporotic spines harvested from female cadavers. After initial strength and stiffness were determined, the vertebral bodies were stabilized using bipedicular injections of cement totaling 2, 4, 6, or 8 mL and recompressed, after which post-treatment strength and stiffness were measured. Strength and stiffness were considered restored when post-treatment values were not significantly different from initial values. RESULTS: Strength was restored for all regions when 2 mL of either cement was injected. To restore stiffness with Orthocomp, the thoracic and thoracolumbar regions required 4 mL, but the lumbar region required 6 mL. To restore stiffness with Simplex 20, the thoracic and lumbar regions required 4 mL, but the thoracolumbar region required 8 mL.

Clinicians practicing vertebroplasty commonly alter the mixture of monomer-to-powder recommended by the manufacturer in an effort to decrease viscosity and increase the working time. The purpose of the current study was to measure the effect of varying the monomer-to-powder ratio on the compressive material properties (compressive modulus, yield stress, and ultimate compressive strength) of the cement Simplex P (Stryker-Howmedica-Osteonics, Rutherford, NJ). Cylindrical specimens were prepared using monomer-to-powder ratios of 0.45 to 1.00 mL/g and tested in compression. Peak compressive material properties occurred at the mixture ratio recommended by the manufacturer (0.5 mL/g) but decreased as the ratio of monomer to powder was increased. The material properties of specimens cured for 1 hour were significantly less than those for specimens cured for 24 hours. The monomer-to-powder ratio affects the compressive material properties of cement. The clinical significance of these results with respect to vertebroplasty is yet to be determined.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of additional vertebral compression fractures diagnosed with repeat MRI immediately before vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebral compression fractures, which occur frequently in the elderly, are more likely in patients with prior vertebral compression fracture. When patients are evaluated for vertebroplasty, it is important to identify all unhealed fractures for effective treatment planning. METHODS: In a retrospective study, we reviewed the records of all patients (n = 194) treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty over a 6-year period at our institution, and identified all patients who had undergone a repeat MRI within 7 days of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. These studies were obtained as part of a clinical protocol prescribing a repeat MRI for any patient whose MRI had been obtained more than 3 months before the evaluation, or who had a change in their pain between referral and evaluation. RESULTS: Twenty patients met inclusion criteria for the immediate preprocedure MRI protocol. A total of 14 new fractures in 11 patients were discovered on the immediate preprocedure MRI. Of these 14, 6 had less than 15% loss of height, making them potentially occult on radiographs; 3 fractures developed in 2 patients who had no change in back pain. CONCLUSION: In select candidates for vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, a repeat preprocedure MRI obtained within 1 week can help ensure that all painful fractures are treated. There is demonstrable value in this protocol for patients with an imaging evaluation over 3 months old or who have had any change in symptoms since the initial imaging workup.",eng,0.0

A biomechanical investigation,", ","Vertebroplasty, which is the percutaneous injection of bone cement into vertebral bodies has recently been used to treat painful osteoporotic compression fractures. Early clinical results have been encouraging, but very little is known about the consequences of augmentation with cement for the adjacent, non-augmented level. We therefore measured the overall failure, strength and structural stiffness of paired osteoporotic two-vertebra functional spine units (FSUs). One FSU of each pair was augmented with polymethylmethacrylate bone cement in the caudal vertebra, while the other served as an untreated control. Compared with the controls, the ultimate failure load for FSUs treated by injection of cement was lower. The geometric mean treated/untreated ratio of failure load was 0.81, with 95% confidence limits from 0.70 to 0.92, (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in overall FSU stiffness. For treated FSUs, there was a trend towards lower failure loads with increased filling with cement (r2 = 0.262, p = 0.13). The current practice of maximum filling with cement to restore the stiffness and strength of a vertebral body may provoke fractures in adjacent, non-augmented vertebrae.

Both procedures are successfully used for pain-relieving stabilizations of osteoporotic fractures or malignant processes. Advantages of kyphoplasty over vertebroplasty are to be seen in the possibility of deformity correction as well as in a decreased risk of cement extrusions which represent the most important potential for clinical complications. Long-term experiences with the effect of cementing are sparse. Thus it seems even more important, to judge indications and possibilities realistically. The decision whether and when to perform an augmentation is influenced by multiple factors. These include age of the patient, age of the fracture, degree of deformation and further degenerative changes of the spine.

Betts,2008.0,Sacral vertebral augmentation: confirmation of fluoroscopic landmarks by open dissection,", ","Sacral insufficiency fractures are a more commonly recognized cause of spine pain among osteoporotic patients, and are now treatable by sacroplasty using percutaneous instillation of PMMA cement. Sacroplasty may be performed using only fluoroscopic landmarks; however, the bony anatomy of the sacrum is complex and the cement deposition based on these landmarks has not been specifically confirmed. In this report we determined the precise fluoroscopic landmarks for cannula placement in a specially prepared excised sacral cadaveric specimen with metal surface markers. The cannulas were placed using the usual dorsal approach, and where the tip was visually seen to breach the cortical surface, fluoroscopic images were obtained and the boundaries of the sacrum were carefully determined. A fluoroscopic cortical breach"" area emerged where a cannula tip would likely be outside the cortical boundaries of the sacrum. With simple sacral vertebroplasty there is no direct control of cement deposition after the PMMA leaves the tip of the cannula. The use of vertebral augmentation devices may be of use to help control cement delivery in performing sacroplasty. We evaluated 2 such devices in cadaver specimens to determine their suitability in performing a sacral vertebral augmentation. Using these same landmarks, a sacral balloon Kyphoplasty was performed and the cadaveric specimen was subsequently bivalved to visually confirm the deposition of cement. On direct inspection the PMMA cement was found to be confined within the sacral cortical boundaries and there was no extravasation near or into the sacral foramen. Based on these fluoroscopic landmarks, the Arcuplasty device was tested in an intact cadaver to determine the optimal cannula placement and locations for creating osteotomies within the sacral trabecular bone prior to PMMA cement deposition. The cement deposition was observed to remain closely confined to the areas where the osteotomies were performed. In the balloon Kyphoplasty specimen the cement deposition was visually confirmed to be confined within the cortical boundaries by open dissection, and both devices have been found successful in creating a more controlled deposition of PMMA cement for performing sacral vertebral augmentation under fluoroscopic imaging.""",eng,1.0
Journal Article,A. Betts,2009.0,Vertebroplasty of the first sacral vertebra,", ","UNLABELLED: The treatment of sacral insufficiency fractures remains an area of active investigation and development, which has typically concentrated on the lateral elements of the sacrum and the sacral ala. Although these fractures frequently involve the first sacral (S1) vertebral body, this structure has eluded a successful technique to accurately access its central portion for percutaneous cannula placement and cement delivery. In this article, we describe a percutaneous cannula placement technique developed in cadaver models, utilizing fluoroscopic imaging to enter the S1 vertebral body using a transpedicular approach. The pedicle provides an anatomically safe entry point, but limits the cannula trajectory to the lateral aspect of the S1 vertebral body, which makes delivery of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) cement to the central body of S1 difficult and unreliable by cannula placement alone. To access the central body of S1 we describe the application of the AVAflex curved nitinol needle, which can be readily directed though the cannula, previously placed through the S1 pedicle, into the central body of S1. The PMMA cement is delivered through the AVAflex needle under fluoroscopic monitoring and results in controlled deposition and good distribution within the central body of S1. The technique employs an extreme caudad angulation of the fluoroscope image intensifier that provides excellent visualization of the sacral spinal canal similar to that obtained with an axial view under CT scan. This view allows for improving transpedicular cannula placement at S1, and real-time fluoroscopic monitoring of the cement deposition to quickly detect and avert possible extravasation toward the central spinal canal. This technique can be used with CT guidance for cannula placement combined with fluoroscopy for cement deposition or done entirely under fluoroscopy alone. Sacroplasty of the lateral sacral element and sacral ala may also be performed at the same time as the S1 vertebroplasty. It appears that with this curved nitinol needle technique, sacral insufficiency fractures that involve the S1 vertebral body may now be safely and accurately addressed. CONCLUSION: The treatment of sacral insufficiency fractures by sacroplasty remains an evolving field. The technique using the curved AVAflex nitinol needle is another way to address the S1 component.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and feasibility of routine preinjection of gelfoam embolization during percutaneous vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty has been used effectively in pain relief for vertebral fractures resulting from malignancy and osteoporosis. However, cement extrusion is a common problem and can lead to complications. Gelfoam embolization of venous channels before cement injection has not been widely used as a technique to prevent leakage. METHODS: Thirty-one patients who met the inclusion-exclusion criteria for the study underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty. Venography was first performed to determine the flow pattern in the vertebrae and confirm needle placement. Next, routine gelfoam embolization of venous channels was performed. This was followed by low-pressure, minimal-volume cement injection. The outcome measure of cement leakage was assessed after surgery using radiographs and CT scans. RESULTS: There were no complications. In the 31 patients, 61 levels of vertebroplasty were performed. Overall, there were 16 leaks out of 61 levels in 12 patients (26.2%). In osteoporotic fractures, there were 11 leaks in 49 levels, giving a leakage rate of 22.5%. There was only 1 epidural leak in this group (2%), and this was asymptomatic. Seven leakages were into the adjacent disc, 2 into the body, and 1 into the paravertebral tissues. In malignant fractures, there were 5 leakages out of 12 levels (41.7%). Of these, 2 were epidural leaks (16.7%), which were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Complications resulting from leakage are the most feared side effect of the procedure. This has resulted in only limited application of vertebroplasty in the United Kingdom. Routine gelfoam embolization together with careful technique has been shown to be a safe and feasible method during vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

A new classification currently under validation and presented in this article was developed in order to aid decision-making for operative interventions. Minimally invasive treatment options include vertebroplasty, kyphopasty and internal fixation. The application of cement provides additional stability but can be accompanied by cement-specific complications, such as extravasation and embolism.",ger,0.0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of minimally invasive treatment of such fractures by percutaneous fixation associated with balloon kyphoplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 2008 and July 2010, 24 patients were treated. There were 12 men and 12 women, with a mean age of 53 years (range 20-88 years). Fractures were classified as one Magerl lesion type A1, one type A2, 19 A3 (five A31, 10 A32, four A33), and three type B2. The treatment was kyphoplasty of the fractured vertebra followed by percutaneous fixation of the vertebra above and below the fracture. Patient follow-up included an analysis of pain using the visual analogic score, the Oswestry score, and functional X-ray and CT analysis. RESULTS: Surgery lasted a mean 99 minutes. At the last follow-up, the mean pain was scored at 0.9 and the Oswestry score was 13.2. Reduction of vertebral kyphosis was 8.6 degrees and reduction of the corrected regional angle was 7.1 degrees . The gain in vertebral height was 17%. All pedicle screws were positioned correctly and no neurological, septic, or thromboembolic complications were observed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Percutaneous osteosynthesis combined with balloon kyphoplasty is a valuable surgical technique in the treatment of thoracolumbar and lumbar fractures with no neurologic deficit. The clinical results are good and the technique allows the patient to return home earlier without having to wear a corset. The X-ray result scores are very encouraging, with corrections similar to conventional surgery in terms of vertebral height and kyphosis. This technique can be an alternative to conventional open surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV: Prospective observational study.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of a calcium phosphate cement (CaP) in balloon kyphoplasty if compared to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, PMMA currently represents the standard in augmentation materials. It is characterized, however, by a lack of osseointegration and limited biocompatibility. Consequently, CaP is currently being investigated as an alternative material for vertebral augmentation. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were 1 or 2 adjacent osteoporotic fractures of vertebral bodies in the thoracolumbar spine, patient age > or =65 years, and fracture age < or =4 months. Exclusion criteria were tumor lesions and additional posterior instrumentation. RESULTS: A total of 60 osteoporotic vertebral body fractures in 56 patients were included. CaP and PMMA were randomly applied in 30 vertebrae each with 2-fracture-patients receiving only 1 type of cement for both vertebrae. All 60 fractures were classified compression fractures (type A). Of these, 27 were classified burst fractures (type A3). 52/56 patients experienced statistically significant pain relief (7.9 +/- 1.9 to 1.8 +/- 2.1 on a Visual Analog Scale from 0 best"" to 10 ""worst""). Bisegmental endplate angles were restored by 6.2 degrees +/- 5.9 degrees on average. Complications that turned out to be cement-specific were: vascular embolism (n = 2) for PMMA; subtotal cement washout (n = 1); and radiographic loss of correction (n = 9) due to cement failure in burst fractures for CaP. There was no case of cement failure, when PMMA had been used. CONCLUSION: The routine use of the CaP tested is not currently recommended for kyphoplasty. Because of its low resistance against flexural, tractive, and shear forces compared to PMMA, in certain constellations (burst fractures), there is a higher risk of cement failure and subsequent loss of correction.""",eng,0.0

Fact or fiction? The reported incidences for new vertebral fractures after cementation or after conservative therapy vary widely. This is mainly due to differences in their design, more specifically as to the duration of followup. Therefore a systematic review of the literature was performed, searching for comparable publications to assess the potential risk of new vertebral fractures following vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty versus conservative treatment. Studies were only included if they granted a standardized one-year radiological follow-up, so improving comparability. However, a high degree of heterogeneity was still seen among the results, which made it impossible to state that cement augmentation is as safe as conservative treatment with respect to new fractures. In other words, it was impossible to separate facts from fiction with the studies available to-day. The combined odds ratio of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty versus conservative treatment, namely 0.96, gave a hint that there might be little difference.

When responsible for neurological impairment, these rare lesions require a decompression procedure. We present the results of a new option to treat these lesions: an open balloon kyphoplasty associated with a short-segment posterior internal fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients, aged a mean 72.3 years, were included in this prospective series; all of them presented osteoporotic burst fractures located between T11 and L2 associated with neurological impairment. The surgical procedure first consisted of a laminectomy, for decompression, followed by an open balloon kyphoplasty. A short-segment posterior internal fixation was subsequently put into place when the local kyphosis was considered severe. A CAT scan study evaluated local vertebral body's height restoration using two pre- and postoperative radiological indices. RESULTS: All of the patients in the series were followed up for a mean 14 months. Local kyphosis improved a mean 10.8 (p<0.001). Vertebral body height was also substantially restored, with a mean gain of 26% according to the anterior height/adjacent height ratio and 28% according to the Beck Index (p<0.001). Two cases of cement leakage were recorded, with no adverse clinical side effect. Complete neurological recovery was observed in 10 patients; two retained a minimal neurological deficit but kept a walking capacity. DISCUSSION: The results presented in this study confirm the data reported in the literature in terms of local kyphosis correction and vertebral body height restoration. The combination of this technique with laminectomy plus osteosynthesis allowed us to effectively treat burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction and led to stable results 1 year after surgery. This can be advantageous in a population often carrying multiple co-morbidities. With a single operation, we can achieve neurological decompression and spinal column stability in a minimally invasive way; this avoids more substantial surgery in these fragile patients.

For the past few years, minimally invasive techniques have been developed to limit surgery-related iatrogenic injury. The objective of this study was to report the results of percutaneous management of these lesions and the technical progress made based on our experience. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients presenting an A3 fracture, with a mean age of 51 years, were included in this study. All had a balloon kyphoplasty and percutaneous osteosynthesis. Of the first 22 cases, kyphoplasty was the initial procedure performed associated with reduction maneuvers using distraction. Assessment was clinical (neurological status and pain intensity) and radiological (implant positioning, cement leakage, restoration of local kyphosis and any loss of correction). RESULTS: In the overall series, the mean local kyphosis correction was 11 degrees with a 2 degrees angle loss at the last follow-up. Pain assessment showed significant improvement, decreasing from 6/10 to 1/10 on discharge. The mean hospital stay lasted 4 days. On the follow-up radiological exams, no cases of extrapedicular screw migration were noted; in two cases, lateral cement leakage was found. The results were equivalent in terms of correction no matter which procedure was performed first, although for the second part of the series the technology was available to bend the spinal fixation rod to the desired curve. DISCUSSION: The results of this study support the growing interest in minimally invasive techniques in the management of spinal injuries with no neurological deficit. In addition, the evolving material makes it possible to come close to conventional techniques, including reduction maneuvers, while limiting muscle injury by using a purely percutaneous approach. Rigorous patient selection is necessary and the time to learn the procedure must be taken into account. Studies with a longer follow-up are required to confirm the stability of the correction over time. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV. Retrospective observational study.",eng,0.0

Vertebroplasty is also briefly reviewed. Non-pharmacological management of osteoporosis is a broad concept. It must be viewed as an essential part of the prevention of fractures from childhood through adulthood and the old age. The topic also includes surgical procedures for the treatment of peripheral and vertebral fractures and the post-fracture rehabilitation. The present document is the result of a consensus, based on a systematic review and a critical appraisal of the literature. Diets deficient in calcium, proteins or vitamin D impair skeletal integrity. The effect of other nutriments is less clear, although an excessive consumption of sodium, caffeine, or fibres exerts negative effects on calcium balance. The deleterious effects of tobacco, excessive alcohol consumption and a low BMI are well accepted. Physical activity is of primary importance to reach optimal peak bone mass but, if numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of various types of exercise on bone mass, fracture data as an endpoint are scanty. Fall prevention strategies are especially efficient in the community setting, but less evidence is available about their effectiveness in preventing fall-related injuries and fractures. The efficacy of hip protectors remains controversial. This is also true for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Several randomized controlled studies had reported a short-term advantage of vertebroplasty over medical treatment for pain relief, but these findings have been questioned by recent sham-controlled randomized clinical studies.",eng,0.0

METHODS: The study group consisted of 123 vertebral bodies (VBs) in 93 patients enrolled in prospective protocols for metastatic disease. Data from these patients were retrospectively analyzed. Stereotactic body radiotherapy consisted of 1, 3, or 5 fractions for overall median doses of 18, 27, and 30 Gy, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging studies, obtained at baseline and at each follow-up, were evaluated for VCFs, tumor involvement, and radiographic progression. Self-reported average pain levels were scored based on the 11-point (0-10) Brief Pain Inventory both at baseline and at follow-up. Obesity was defined as a body mass index >/= 30. RESULTS: The median imaging follow-up was 14.9 months (range 1-71 months). Twenty-five new or progressing fractures (20%) were identified, and the median time to progression was 3 months after SBRT. The most common histologies included renal cancer (36 VBs, 10 fractures, 10 tumor progressions), breast cancer (20 VBs, 0 fractures, 5 tumor progressions), thyroid cancer (14 VBs, 1 fracture, 2 tumor progressions), non-small cell lung cancer (13 VBs, 3 fractures, 3 tumor progressions), and sarcoma (9 VBs, 2 fractures, 2 tumor progressions). Fifteen VBs were treated with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty after SBRT, with 5 procedures done for preexisting VCFs. Tumor progression was noted in 32 locations (26%) with 5 months' median time to progression. At the time of noted fracture progression there was a trend toward higher average pain scores but no significant change in the median value. Univariate logistic regression showed that an age > 55 years (HR 6.05, 95% CI 2.1-17.47), a preexisting fracture (HR 5.05, 95% CI 1.94-13.16), baseline pain and narcotic use before SBRT (pain: HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06-1.62; narcotic: HR 2.98, 95% CI 1.17-7.56) and after SBRT (pain: HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.70; narcotic: HR 3.63, 95% CI 1.41-9.29) were statistically significant predictors of fracture progression. On multivariate analysis an age > 55 years (HR 10.66, 95% CI 2.81-40.36), a preexisting fracture (HR 9.17, 95% CI 2.31-36.43), and baseline pain (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.9) were found to be significant risks, whereas obesity (HR 0.02, 95% CI 0-0.2) was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic body radiotherapy is associated with a significant risk (20%) of VCF. Risk factors for VCF include an age > 55 years, a preexisting fracture, and baseline pain. These risk factors may aid in the selection of which spinal SBRT patients should be considered for prophylactic vertebral stabilization or augmentation procedures.

Almost invariably, an injectable poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement that contains a large amount of BaSO(4) particles is used in these procedures. The deleterious effects of this radiopacifier on various properties of PMMA cement have been detailed in the literature. The objective of the present study was therefore to avoid such high levels of inorganic contrast agent and thus to develop an all-polymeric bone cement, for which radiopacity was provided by 60 wt % of an iodine-containing methacrylic copolymer, incorporated into the powder (IO cement), ultimately leading to 6.6 wt % of iodine in the cement. A large array of properties of this cement were determined, ranging from setting time and injectability to fatigue life under fully-reversed tension-compression loading and cytotoxicity, and a comprehensive comparison with a cement containing 30 wt % BaSO(4) in the powder component (BA cement) has been made (11 wt % of Ba in the cement).

METHODS: The biomechanics model was derived axiomatically from a consideration of the anatomy of vertebral column when affected by compression fractures. Proof of principle was provided by performing controlled diagnostic blocks in six patients. RESULTS: The biomechanics model shows that the posterior elements of the vertebral column must subluxate cephalad or caudad in response to deformity of a vertebral body. The model implies that pain may arise from the posterior elements, and predicts that anesthetizing the posterior elements should relieve the pain of compression fractures. Six cases are described in which controlled medial branch blocks relieved the pain of compression fractures of thoracic or lumbar vertebral bodies.

Besides fat embolism, cement leakage is considered to be one of the major and most severe complications during percutaneous vertebroplasty. The viscosity of the PMMA during injection plays a key role in this context. It was shown in vitro that the best way to lower the risk of cement leakage is to inject the cement at higher viscosity, which is requires high injection forces. Injection forces can be reduced by applying a newly developed lavage technique as it was shown in vitro using human cadaver vertebrae. The purpose of this study was to prove the in vitro results in an in vivo model. The investigation was incorporated in an animal study that was performed to evaluate the cardiovascular reaction on cement augmentation using the lavage technique. Injection forces were measured with instrumentation for 1 cc syringes, additionally acquiring plunger displacement. Averaged injection forces measured, ranged from 12 to 130 N and from 28 to 140 N for the lavage group and the control group, respectively. Normalized injection forces (by viscosity and injection speed) showed a trend to be lower for the lavage group in comparison to the control group (P = 0.073).

An increased fracture rate of the adjacent vertebrae has been observed after vertebroplasty. Decreased failure strength has been noted in a laboratory study of augmented functional spine units (FSUs), where the adjacent, non-augmented vertebral body always failed. This may provide evidence that rigid cement augmentation may facilitate the subsequent collapse of the adjacent vertebrae. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the decrease in failure strength of augmented FSUs can be avoided using low-modulus PMMA bone cement. In cadaveric FSUs, overall stiffness, failure strength and stiffness of the two vertebral bodies were determined under compression for both the treated and untreated specimens. Augmentation was performed on the caudal vertebrae with either regular or low-modulus PMMA. Endplate and wedge-shaped fractures occurred in the cranial and caudal vertebrae in the ratios endplate:wedge (cranial:caudal): 3:8 (5:6), 4:7 (7:4) and 10:1 (10:1) for control, low-modulus and regular cement group, respectively. The mean failure strength was 3.3 +/- 1 MPa with low-modulus cement, 2.9 +/- 1.2 MPa with regular cement and 3.6 +/- 1.3 MPa for the control group. Differences between the groups were not significant (p = 0.754 and p = 0.375, respectively, for low-modulus cement vs. control and regular cement vs. control). Overall FSU stiffness was not significantly affected by augmentation. Significant differences were observed for the stiffness differences of the cranial to the caudal vertebral body for the regular PMMA group to the other groups (p < 0.003). The individual vertebral stiffness values clearly showed the stiffening effect of the regular cement and the lesser alteration of the stiffness of the augmented vertebrae using the low-modulus PMMA compared to the control group (p = 0.999).

Cement leakage is considered to be one of the major and most severe complications during percutaneous vertebroplasty. The viscosity of the material plays a key role in this context. In order to enhance the safety for the patient, a rheometer system was developed to measure the cement viscosity intraoperatively. For this development, it is of great importance to know the proper viscosity to start the procedure determined by experienced surgeons and the relation between the time period when different injection devices are used and the cement viscosity. The purpose of the study was to investigate the viscosity ranges for different injection systems during conventional vertebroplasty. Clinically observed viscosity values and related time periods showed high scattering. In order to get a better understanding of the clinical observations, cement viscosity during hardening at different ambient temperatures and by simulation of the body temperature was investigated in vitro. It could be concluded, that the direct viscosity assessment with a rheometer during vertebroplasty can help clinicians to define a lower threshold viscosity and thereby decrease the risk of leakage and make adjustments to their injection technique in real time. Secondly, the acceleration in hardening of PMMA-based cements at body temperature can be useful in minimizing leakages by addressing them with a short injection break.",eng,0.0

It has low complication rates, is successful in alleviating pain, and improves the patients' mobility and quality of life. A series of questions remain open though or are the subject of controversial debate; for example, the results of several biomechanical studies are in part contradictory. Clinical data on subsequent fractures are also still inadequate, although the majority of studies show no elevated rate of subsequent fractures following treatment with cementoplasty in comparison to the natural course in patients with osteoporotic fractures. Kyphoplasty has the advantage of being able to restore the vertebral body height or reduce the kyphosis angle without leading to different clinical outcomes in comparison to vertebroplasty. Biomechanical considerations on whether restoration of the vertebral body's normal shape could reduce the rate of subsequent fractures still need scientific substantiation. Both surgical methods are employed in our clinic. Kyphoplasty seems to us to be indicated when the height of the anterior portion of the vertebral body is reduced by one-third compared to the norm or a kyphosis angle of more than 15-20 degrees is present. The goals of therapy are restoring the shape and reducing the kyphosis angle. This can only succeed, however, in fractures that are not older than 3 weeks.

METHODS: Seventy-five patients with intractable pain due to low energy vertebral compression fractures between T11 and L5 were treated with vertebroplasty at 150 vertebral levels. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were utilized to characterize vertebral parameters including the type of nutrient foramina in the posterior vertebral cortex. Following vertebroplasty, distance from the needle tracts to the midline and the presence and type of any epidural cement leakage were determined. Using logistic regression analysis, significant risk factors for cement leakage were determined. RESULTS: A smaller distance between the tip of the needle and the midline and a magistral type of venobasillar system were found to be significant risk factors for epidural cement leakage (P < 0.0001). Use of a bipedicular vs. monopedicular technique did not significantly affect the rate of epidural cement leakage (P = 0.3869). LIMITATIONS: This study is limited because of the relatively small number of patients and the lack of any patients who had clinical consequences as a result of extensive epidural cement leakage. CONCLUSION: The type of venobasillar system should be taken into account when planning a vertebroplasty procedure as a magistral type of venobasillar system is associated with the increased rate of epidural cement leakage. It is important to try and achieve a large distance between the needle tip and the midline, especially when a magistral type of venobasillar system is present, to reduce the risk of epidural cement leakage.",eng,1.0

The vertebral bodies of the transitional area between the thoracic and lumbar spine are often involved. A large number of unreported or late-diagnosed fractures have to be assumed. If risk factors such as advanced age or comorbidities are present in the case of new-onset back pain, an osteoporotic vertebral body fracture as a possible cause has to be considered. This sets the diagnostic workup in motion, consisting of clinical and radiological examinations. In addition to conservative treatment, minimal invasive cement augmentation of the fracture via vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is an option. Open surgical procedures, feared by older patients and their physicians, are rarely necessary. Of utmost importance after dealing with the fracture is the subsequent treatment of the underlying osteoporotic disease to prevent the occurrence of further fractures.",ger,0.0

METHODS: The aim was to study the deployment of an implant dedicated to the vertebral augmentation by percutaneous approach (kyphoplasty). Its kinematics and the related forces have been investigated. A theoretical model of deployment has been proposed and the ancillary was instrumented with strain gauges and Hall effect sensors to measure kinematics and force in the deployment actuator (tensile rod). The methodology was first evaluated ex-vivo in a test-bench with boundary conditions monitored by a tensile machine. Then, a cadaver study was carried out in three lumbar and thoracic vertebral segments of normal and osteoporotic spines. FINDINGS: The relationships between ancillary internal forces, deployment, and cranio-caudal pushing force have been obtained. The test-bench experiment showed quasi-proportional relationship between force distribution and kinematics during the deployment. Ex-vivo cranio-caudal pushing forces were measured. Cadaver studies showed cranio-caudal pushing forces comprised between 100N and 200N. These forces were dependent upon the implant location in the vertebral body and bone stock. INTERPRETATION: The methodology was related to the analysis of load distribution and kinematics of a deployable implant for vertebral augmentation. The ancillary instrumentation contributed to the objective quantification of the surgical technique. The cadaver study in normal and osteoporotic spines exhibited the role of bone properties and implant location in implant deployment. This pilot study showed a methodology to improve the kyphoplasty surgery and patient comfort in clinical routine.",eng,0.0

Posterior vertebral element fractures can occur during or after interspinous spacer implants, especially in patients with osteopenia. The purpose of our study was to assess the biomechanical rationale, safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of posterior vertebral arch cement augmentation (spinoplasty) in preventing delayed spinous process fractures after interspinous spacer implants in patients with risk factors for fragility fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a nonrandomized historically controlled clinical trial. From June 2007 to March 2010, we implanted interspinous spacers in 35 eligible patients with fragility-fracture risk factors. In 19/35 patients treated after April 2009, after we assessed the theoretic biomechanical effects of cement augmentation of the spinous process and laminae by FEM, a percutaneous spinoplasty was also performed. Clinical and radiologic follow-up ranged between 12 and 36 months after the intervention. RESULTS: No intraprocedural spinous process fractures were observed in either group, and no patients in the 24-hour postoperative period had complications that were procedure-related. Symptomatic delayed spinous process fractures were diagnosed in 4/16 patients who did not undergo spinoplasty (25.0%), while no fractures were diagnosed in the 19 treated patients (P = .035). CONCLUSIONS: Spinoplasty is feasible and safe. It has a biomechanical rationale, as demonstrated by an FEM. In our preliminary experience, it seems effective in preventing delayed fractures of the posterior arch post-interspinous spacer placement in patients at risk for fragility fractures. These patients have a significant risk of developing a symptomatic delayed spinous process fracture if not treated with spinoplasty.",eng,0.0

We compared the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty to nonsurgical therapy over 24 months in patients with acute painful fractures. Adults with one to three vertebral fractures were randomized within 3 months from onset of pain to undergo kyphoplasty (n = 149) or nonsurgical therapy (n = 151). Quality of life, function, disability, and pain were assessed over 24 months. Kyphoplasty was associated with greater improvements in Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores when averaged across the 24-month follow-up period compared with nonsurgical therapy [overall treatment effect 3.24 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.47-5.01, p = .0004]; the treatment difference remained statistically significant at 6 months (3.39 points, 95% CI 1.13-5.64, p = .003) but not at 12 months (1.70 points, 95% CI -0.59 to 3.98, p = .15) or 24 months (1.68 points, 95% CI -0.63 to 3.99, p = .15). Greater improvement in back pain was observed over 24 months for kyphoplasty (overall treatment effect -1.49 points, 95% CI -1.88 to -1.10, p < .0001); the difference between groups remained statistically significant at 24 months (-0.80 points, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.20, p = .009). There were two device-related serious adverse events in the second year that occurred at index vertebrae (a spondylitis and an anterior cement migration). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in the number of patients (47.5% for kyphoplasty, 44.1% for control) with new radiographic vertebral fractures; fewer fractures occurred (~18%) within the second year. Compared with nonsurgical management, kyphoplasty rapidly reduces pain and improves function, disability, and quality of life without increasing the risk of additional vertebral fractures. The differences from nonsurgical management are statistically significant when averaged across 24 months. Most outcomes are not statistically different at 24 months, but the reduction in back pain remains statistically significant at all time points.",eng,0.0

In general, the procedures appear to be cost effective but are very dependent upon model input details. Better data, rather than new models, are needed to answer outstanding questions. Vertebral augmentation procedures (VAPs), including vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), seek to stabilise fractured vertebral bodies and reduce pain. The aim of this paper is to review current literature on the cost-effectiveness of VAPs as well as to discuss the challenges for economic evaluation in this research area. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify existing published studies on the cost-effectiveness of VAPs in patients with osteoporosis. Only peer-reviewed published articles that fulfilled the criteria of being regarded as full economic evaluations including both morbidity and mortality in the outcome measure in the form of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were included. The search identified 949 studies, of which four (0.4 %) were identified as relevant with one study added later. The reviewed studies differed widely in terms of study design, modelling framework and data used, yielding different results and conclusions regarding the cost-effectiveness of VAPs. Three out of five studies indicated in the base case results that VAPs were cost effective compared to non-surgical management (NSM). The five main factors that drove the variations in the cost-effectiveness between the studies were time horizon, quality of life effect of treatment, offset time of the treatment effect, reduced number of bed days associated with VAPs and mortality benefit with treatment. The cost-effectiveness of VAPs is uncertain. In answering the remaining questions, new cost-effectiveness analysis will yield limited benefit. Rather, studies that can reduce the uncertainty in the underlying data, especially regarding the long-term clinical outcomes of VAPs, should be conducted.",eng,0.0

Of the improved overall quality of life, 60 % was caused by decreased pain. However, ignoring other dimensions of quality of life would underestimate the procedure's effect. INTRODUCTION: Acute back pain has been viewed as the most important factor lowering quality of life (QoL) for patients suffering vertebral fractures. The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of different health dimensions on overall QoL using patient-reported outcome measurements (PROMs) collected in Fracture Reduction Evaluation (FREE) trial. METHODS: The analysis was based on patients included in the 2-year-long randomised controlled FREE trial studying the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty procedure (BKP) compared to non-surgical management (NSM). The PROMs included were EQ-5D, Short Form (SF)-36, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). The health dimensional contribution to the overall QoL improvements was analysed by isolating the impact of each dimension on QoL in the SF-36 and EQ-5D, respectively. A correlation analysis of the QoL improvement was performed to investigate the relationships between the four instruments. RESULTS: Changes in pain explained 60 % of the quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained in BKP vs. NSM followed by self-care (17 %), mobility (16 %) and usual activities (10 %) (EQ-5D). Health dimensions capturing the mental state had little impact on the QALY gained. The SF-36 dimensional analysis showed similar results. The correlation analysis showed that the correlation between VAS pain, RMDQ and QALY improvement was fairly weak. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the pain dimension of health are the most important drivers for changes of overall QoL in patients treated with BKP or NSM. However, ignoring the impact of other dimensions would lead to an underestimation of the actual improvement in overall QoL.",eng,0.0

In addition, the data analysis should be used to clarify whether differences arise concerning the treatment success, depending on the number and/or position of the augmented vertebral bodies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of all patients who were admitted and operated on for vertebral body fractures between 2004 and 2009 were collected and evaluated for this study. The patients were examined pre-operatively and during the control visits clinically and radiologically. The intensity of pain was recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS: 0-100 mm). To determine the functional limitations the Oswestry questionnaire was used. In addition, the middle and anterior heights of the vertebral body and the kyphosis angle were measured. To perform the balloon kyphoplasty the Kyphon(R) system was applied. The findings of all patients were documented in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty for up to 3 years and to compare them with regard to the differences depending on the number and/or location of vertebral fractures (T = 1, T > 1, L = 1, L > 1, T + L). RESULTS: The overall evaluation of all patients (n = 464) in whom a balloon kyphoplasty was carried out showed an average improvement in VAS scores by 53 mm and the Oswestry scores by 47 percentage points. It was possible to demonstrate a significant improvement of the vertebral body height (mean 1.6 mm) and the kyphosis angle (1.3 degrees) in long-term controls up to 3 years. When comparing the findings in the groups that had been operated on a different number of vertebrae and/or at different positions in the spinal region (n = 466) it could be proven that the average decrease in pain intensity did not differ in all 5 groups (> 50 mm). Also for the Oswestry scores the reduction was almost comparable in all 5 groups. The radiological findings did not show striking differences between the 5 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Balloon kyphoplasty was proven to be a safe and effective procedure. Thus, the balloon kyphoplasty in carefully selected patients can yield better results than a non-invasive conservative treatment. It contributes decisively a better quality of life for the operated patients and diminishes the risks of long-lasting treatment with drugs.",ger,0.0

Conservative care is the default approach. Radiofrequency kyphoplasty uses ultrahigh viscosity cement to restore spinal posture and stabilize the fracture. The aims of this study were to compare radiofrequency kyphoplasty to conservative care and assess the usual algorithm of starting all patients on conservative care for 6 weeks before offering surgery. METHODS: Elderly patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were all treated with 6 weeks of conservative care (analgesics, bracing, and physiotherapy). They were then offered the choice of continuing conservative care or crossing over to radiofrequency kyphoplasty, at 6 and 12 weeks. Clinical success was defined as: (1) VAS pain improvement >/=2, (2) final VAS pain </=5, (3) no functional worsening on ODI. RESULTS: After the initial 6 weeks of conservative care, only 1 of 65 patients met the criteria for clinical success, and median VAS improvement was 0. After 12 weeks of conservative care, only 5 of 38 patients met the criteria for clinical success, and median VAS improvement was 1. At the 6-week follow-up after radiofrequency kyphoplasty, 31 of 33 surgery patients met the criteria for clinical success, and median VAS improvement was 5. CONCLUSION: For the vast majority of patients with a VAS >/=5, conservative care did not provide meaningful clinical improvement. In contrast, nearly all patients who underwent radiofrequency kyphoplasty had rapid substantial improvement. Surgery was clearly much more effective than conservative care and should be offered to patients much sooner.",eng,0.0

Additionally, a comparison of this new and innovative procedure with conservative treatment was carried out. PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures according to the common findings in an orthopaedic university hospital were included in the comparison study in which the indication for surgical intervention action according to the DVO guidelines was interdisciplinary confirmed. For the comparison group, patients with the same clinical and radiological findings were recruited who rejected a surgical intervention. For surgery, the StabiliT(R) Vertebral Augmentation System for a radiofrequency kyphoplasty by the company DFine was used. The cement was injected with a multiplex controller"". Thus, the results of the new method were compared to those of a group that was treated conservatively. RESULTS: The radiofrequency kyphoplasty (n = 114) resulted in an average decrease of VAS scores by almost 60 mm, which increased during the follow-up. Similarly, the Oswestry scores showed a marked improvement by 46 % points after 6 weeks. The mean increase in vertebral body height was 2.8 mm after radiofrequency kyphoplasty. In the conservatively treated group only very small changes compared to the initial findings were registered during the 6-week observation period. Accordingly, 33 of 67 patients decided after 6 weeks for surgery, which led to corresponding improvements (VAS, Oswestry, vertebral body height). Noteworthy is the low rate of cement leakage in the radiofrequency kyphoplasty group of 6 % (n = 7). CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency kyphoplasty offers a secure superiority over conservative treatment regarding clinical efficacy. In addition, the fractured vertebrae can be better targeted and erected, a longer processing time of the cement is ensured, a high interdigitation of the cement with the bone is guaranteed, the rate of cement leakage is low, the risk of radiation for the surgeon is minimised, and the operation time is shortened.""",ger,0.0

Pflugmacher,2014.0,Treatment options for vertebral fractures an overview of different philosophies and techniques for vertebral augmentation,10.1007/s00590-013-1257-3,"PURPOSE: For more than 30 years, minimally invasive surgical procedures have been available to stabilize the fractured vertebrae by cement augmentation leading to significant pain relief, a distinct improvement in quality of life and decreased mortality for patients suffering from osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. This overview article is designed to provide information on the wide range of augmentation methods previously tested and clinically applied in surgery in an attempt to compile the clinically relevant information on safety and efficacy in the published literature. METHOD: Based on an extensive literature review on the topic of vertebral fractures--surgical augmentation techniques"" we summarized the results of published clinical trials and experimental testing which address clinically relevant questions. The selection of the publications in reference books and scientific journals covers the time period from the end of the 1970s until the present. RESULTS: The final selection of more than 50 publications with, in the opinion of the authors, clinically relevant data led to the following results, which can be of significance for clinical application. The prerequisites for the success of all augmentation methods include the earliest possible surgical intervention, optimal technical equipment and an experienced, interdisciplinary team, as well as thorough consideration of the situation of the individual patient. The selection of the material for vertebral augmentation depends on the surgical method. The material of choice remains polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and the best record of efficacy and safety is displayed by radiofrequency kyphoplasty with ultrahigh-viscosity cement. Regarding clinical efficacy and safety, there are many convincing documentations showing superiority of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in comparison with conservative therapeutic regimens. Initial results of clinical studies with additional implants indicate a trend toward further improvement in clinical success and suggest possible broader clinical possibilities of application. CONCLUSION: Modern, minimally invasive augmentation techniques represent a real alternative to conservative treatment of patients with vertebral fractures. Further technical and clinical development in this area should aim at optimizing procedural safety while continuing to achieve comparably good results to current methods. Minimizing damage to the remaining trabecular structures as well as to adjacent vertebral disks and vertebrae should be paramount of importance. SUMMARY: Options for the treatment of vertebral fractures: Reductions in bone density and pathological changes in bone structure are associated with an elevated risk of fractures, which can lead to decisive functional impairment, pain, and a host of further comorbidities. Vertebral augmentation can be considered as an alternative conservative treatment, in order to achieve immediate and lasting pain relief as well as improvement in functional impairment. To achieve greater safety, instrumentation for transpedicular access and incorporation of radiopacifiers in PMMA for vertebroplasty were developed in mid-eighties. Balloon kyphoplasty was introduced in the end nineties, and results of prospective, randomized clinical studies have confirmed the safety and efficacy; the destruction of the remaining native spongiosa structures during balloon expansion is viewed as a disadvantage of this method. The two step method of cavity creation followed by cement delivery known as kyphoplasty has been further refined and developed by and varied by technology/procedural developments. This includes most the radiofrequency kyphoplasty (DFINE Inc., San Jose, CA, USA), in which ultrahigh-viscosity cement is delivered at a controlled delivery rate, following producing a bone sparing size and side specific cavity which minimizes loss of spongiosa, allowing for mechanical stability upon interdigitation of cement into that remaining trabecular bone. This combination has been shown to preserve vertebral structures and reduces the risk of leakages. Finally, systems have been available in which cement augmentation of implants to enhance mechanical stability of the implants or the overall fracture is constructed by load sharing.""",eng,0.0

Pflugmacher,2016.0,Elastoplasty: A Silicon Polymer as a New Filling Material for Kyphoplasty in Comparison to PMMA,", ","BACKGROUND: Painful vertebral compression fractures (VCF) caused by osteoporosis are a common health problem in the elderly population. If conservative treatments are unsuccessful, surgical treatments like vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty are recommended. But the use of Polymethylmethacrylat (PMMA) bone cement for augmentation surgery is associated with risks. OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of a newly developed silicon polymer (VK100) that can be used instead of PMMA bone cement for kyphoplasty treatments. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of 30 patients comparing the outcomes of kyphoplasty treatments conducted with PMMA and VK100. SETTING: Clinic for Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery Bonn, Germany. METHODS: Thirty patients with one to 3 VCF were treated either with balloon kyphoplasty using VK100 or balloon kyphoplasty using PMMA bone cement. Data from both groups was compared by a matched pair analysis. The medial vertebral height was measured at each examination radiologically. The patients stated their pain intensity using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the patient's functional impairment was evaluated with the Oswestry-Disability-Index (ODI).All data were assessed before surgery, and 3 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. Intraoperative and postoperative adverse events were documented. RESULTS: The patients' functional impairment and pain improved significantly after surgery. The course of ODI and VAS was comparable in both treatment groups, but the improvement in the VK group was significantly ongoing until the 12 month follow-up. Vertebral height improvement was significant in both groups, but the PMMA group achieved a better absolute restoration. The vertebral height stayed constant during the follow-up in the VK group and worsened significantly in the PMMA group. There was no significant difference between groups concerning the occurrence of additional fractures; and no other types of complications or surgery-related adverse events were observed in either the PMMA group or in the VK group. LIMITATIONS: The study is only a matched pair analysis of 15 patients for each procedure and the amount of injected filling material was not recorded. CONCLUSION(S): The study results demonstrate that the clinical outcome of VAS and ODI of using the silicon polymer VK100 is comparable or slightly better than using PMMA. VK 100 shows a trend to minor additional fractures during the follow-up. However, height restoration is not satisfactory in comparison to PMMA, although vertebral height stayed more or less constant in the VK group. To address the augmentation success further, it would be necessary to study a larger patient group over a longer study period and to assess additional parameters such as bone density and injected amount of filling material.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,M. P. Bostrom; J. M. Lane,1997.0,Future directions. Augmentation of osteoporotic vertebral bodies,", ","Because current medical and surgical treatments of vertebral body fractures are less than adequate, there is a need for interventions that decrease the likelihood of occurrence of these fractures and improve the treatment options once they have occurred. One such broad category of intervention involves the fortification or augmentation of the vertebral bodies. In addition to prophylactically stabilizing osteoporotic vertebral bodies at risk for fracture, augmentation of vertebral bodies that have already fractured may prove to be useful by reducing pain, improving function, and preventing further collapse and deformity. Vertebral body augmentation can also be used as an adjunct to fixation of internal hardware--for example, pedicle screws-in osteoporotic spines. A number of products are now available or are in clinical trials. The most promising products are injectable materials-polymethylmethacrylate or mineral bone cement. The early clinical results using polymethylmethacrylate in percutaneous vertebroplasty for fractured vertebral bodies and the results in vitro using an injectable mineral cement for vertebral body fortification are encouraging. Although the principle of vertebral body augmentation remains encouraging, data to support the widespread use of these techniques remain sparse, and the indications for their use should be more clearly defined.",eng,0.0

Hellbusch,2012.0,Combined open decompressive laminectomy and vertebroplasty for treatment of thoracolumbar fractures retrospective review of 41 cases,10.1016/j.clineuro.2012.01.043,"BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures are common, and can occur concomitantly in patients with symptomatic degenerative stenosis. Less commonly, complicated vertebral body fractures may involve retropulsion of bone into the spinal canal, resulting in stenosis with myelopathy and/or radiculopathy. Decompression of the neural elements can lead to destabilization and progressive kyphotic deformity. Laminectomy combined with open vertebroplasty provides a way to decompress the neural elements and stabilize the anterior columns in patients who cannot tolerate extended surgical time or complications associated with instrumentation and fusion. The authors describe the combination of decompressive laminectomy and open transpedicular vertebroplasty as a means to decompress neural elements and simultaneously stabilize the anterior vertebral column. METHODS: Forty-one patients with a total of 51 thoracolumbar fractures were included in this retrospective case review. A decompressive laminectomy was performed first, followed by vertebroplasty using an open transpedicular approach. For subjective assessment of outcome, the patients were assessed using the Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire and additional questions pertaining to the patient's condition. RESULTS: Out of 51 fractures, there were 15 burst fractures and 36 compression fractures. Fracture levels ranged from T12 to S1. The average follow-up period was 27 months (range, 0.5-60 months). The mean post-operative Oswestry score was 16 (range, 0-39), and all patients except for one were subjectively pleased with the results of the procedure and said they would recommend it to others. All patients were able to return to all routine activities of daily living. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' cases indicate combining open decompressive laminectomies with vertebroplasty can be an effective treatment for patients with complicated thoracic and lumbar fractures without involving bone fusion or spinal instrumentation and with good long-term outcomes.",eng,0.0

Fracture reduction is, however, not possible and the risk of uncontrolled epidural cement leakage with burst fractures is increased. Kyphoplasty, in contrast, allows a degree of fracture reduction and provides an extended spectrum of indications through open approaches, which enable spinal decompression and augmentation of incomplete burst fractures. METHODS. In kyphoplasty a contrast-filled balloon is inflated in the vertebra until a cavern is created. A degree of reposition may be achieved depending on fracture age. Augmentation is performed with high-viscosity polymethylmethacrylate under low pressure. In cases of neural compression, interlaminary spinal decompression and kyphoplasty through the posterior wall is performed. With anterior spinal procedures, kyphoplasty can be performed without extending the approach. RESULTS: Vertebral augmentation was performed by percutaneous, interlaminary, and anterior approaches for incomplete burst fractures. Four representative cases are presented from a collective of 120 augmentations.

In contrast to vertebroplasty, the kyphoplasty technique allows an age-dependent fracture reduction through the inflation of a special balloon in the fractured cancellous bone of the vertebral body. The cancellous bone of the fracture zone is compressed by the balloon, so that a cavity remains in the vertebral body after removing the balloon, which is filled with highly viscous augmentation material. The reduced risk of serious complications, for example epidural leakage of augmentation material, justifies progressively expanding the indications for this technique to traumatic fractures with involvement of the posterior vertebral wall and neoplastic vertebral collapse due to osteolytic metastasis. Besides the indications for the conventional percutaneous approaches, the microsurgical interlaminary approach allows the use of kyphoplasty in more complex fractures involving compression of the neural structures. Kyphoplasty induces swift pain relief and allows rapid mobilisation of patients due to the immediate stabilisation of the affected vertebral bodies. Apart from the operative intervention, the medical treatment of the primary disease and the rehabilitation of the individual patient should be optimised through an interdisciplinary approach.",ger,0.0

Jaksche,2004.0,Microsurgical interlaminary vertebro- and kyphoplasty for severe osteoporotic fractures,", ","OBJECT: Percutaneous vertebro- and kyphoplasty have become established methods for the treatment of uncomplicated osteoporotic vertebral fractures. In the setting of severe fractures involving fragmentation of the posterior wall and neural compromise, however, decompressive surgery cannot be performed and epidural cement leakage is poorly controlled. A microsurgical interlaminary approach for vertebro- and kyphoplasty was developed to allow spinal decompression and control of the spinal canal during augmentation. METHODS: Interlaminary vertebro- or kyphoplasty was performed in 24 patients with osteoporotic fractures involving neural compression or posterior wall fragmentation. After unilateral microsurgical fenestration, decompression of the spine, and gentle mobilization of the thecal sac, vertebro- or kyphoplasty was performed directly through the posterior wall of the fractured vertebral body. Cement was injected under microscopic and fluoroscopic control, with the option of immediate exploration of the exposed spinal canal. Thirty-four levels (T-8 to L-5) were treated. Mean blood loss was less than 100 ml and augmentation added 10 to 40 minutes to the entire procedure. Cement leakage associated with the kyphoplasty procedure was less than that in vertebroplasty. There were no major complications. One patient was lost to follow up. Clinical outcome was good or excellent in 17 of the 23 patients available for follow-up (1 to 31-month) evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The present microsurgical interlaminary approach for vertebro- and kyphoplasty enables treatment of severe osteoporotic fractures involving fragmentation of the posterior wall and neural compromise. Decompressive surgery is possible and the risk of epidural cement leakage is controlled intraoperatively. This technique can be regarded as a procedure on the treatment continuum between percutaneous augmentation and conventional open reconstruction.",eng,0.0

As there is no standardized methodology, we propose a novel method using reproducible and pathologically representative flow models to study the influence of cement properties on injection behaviour. The models, confined between an upper glass window and a lower aluminium plate, were filled with bone marrow substitute and then injected (4, 6 and 8 min after cement mixing) with commercially available bone cements (SimplexP, Opacity+, OsteopalV and Parallax) at a constant flow rate (3 mL/min). A load cell was used to measure the force applied on the syringe plunger and calculate the peak pressure. A camera was used to monitor the cement flow during injection and calculate the following parameters when the cement had reached the boundary of the models: the time to reach the boundary, the filled area and the roundness. The peak pressure was comparable to that reported during clinical vertebroplasty and showed a similar increase with injection time. The study highlighted the influence of cement formulations and model structure on the injection behaviour and showed that cements with similar composition/particle size had similar flow behaviour, while the introduction of defects reduced the time to reach the boundary, the filled area and the roundness. The proposed method provides a novel tool for quick, robust differentiation between various cement formulations through the visualization and quantitative analysis of the cement spreading at various time intervals.",eng,1.0

This study is based on a systematic review of the literature (until October 2004) and meta-analysis of clinical studies assessing the efficacy and safety of BK in the treatment of VCFs. Estimates of effect were based on a random effects model. Meta-regression analyses were carried out where required. A total of 26 studies met the inclusion criteria. Although studies displayed considerable methodological limitations, the results of the clinical series indicate significant improvements in pain intensity, vertebral height, sagittal alignment, functional capacity, and quality of life. Compared with conventional medical management, BK afforded significant improvement in pain intensity and mobility. Likewise, a significant reduction was observed in vertebral collapse, kyphotic deformity, the development of new vertebral fractures, and hospital stay. Compared with vertebroplasty, the technique reduced the loss of height and the degree of kyphotic deformity, and afforded a significantly lower leakage rate-with no differences in relation to other variables. Regarding adverse effects, leakage affected 7% of all levels treated, while complications were recorded in 2% of the patients, and new vertebral fractures in 16%. The available evidence suggests that BK can be effective and safe in application to VCFs. However, existing studies evince substantial methodological limitations and relatively short follow-up periods. Better clinical research is required to determine the capacity of BK to avoid the functional and physiological sequelae of VCFs and to define the true role of the technique among the existing therapeutic options.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Systematic review of the literature, until September 2013, and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials performed in Europe assessing the safety of balloon kyphoplasty in patients with symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Outcomes sought include cement leaks, serious clinical complications and new vertebral fractures. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These studies included data on 525 treated levels in 424 patients. Cement leakages were detected in 18.3 % (95 % CI 11.6, 23.0) of fractures intervened. In about 0.5 % (95 % CI 0.1, 1.1) of fractures leakages proved to be symptomatic. Serious clinical complications were recorded in 11.5 % (95 % CI 1.1, 21.7) of patients treated with balloon kyphoplasty with several of these cases requiring intensive treatment or postoperative surgery. New vertebral fractures were detected in 20.7 % (95 % CI 0.4, 40.9) of patients treated but rates showed an upward pattern when the follow-up period increased. In 54 % of such cases, the fractures were located in regions adjacent to the treated level. CONCLUSIONS: The safety profile and associated complications of balloon kyphoplasty shown in this analysis, based on the evidence provided by existing randomized controlled trials, can be of help to the practicing clinician who must contrast them with the potential benefits of the technique.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and outcome of vertebroplasty compared with unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in terms of pain, functional capacity and height restoration rates. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The vertebroplasty procedure was first performed in 1984 for the treatment of a hemangioma at the C2 vertebra. Kyphoplasty was first performed in 1998 and includes vertebral height restoration in addition to using inflation balloons and high-viscosity cement. Both are efficacious, safe and long-lasting procedures. However, controversy still exists about pain relief, improvement in functional capacity, quality of life and height restoration the superiority of these procedures and assessment of appropriate and specific indications of one over the other remains undefined. METHODS: Between 2004 and 2011, 296 patients suffering from osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture underwent 433 vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures. Visual analogue scale (VAS), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and height restoration rates were used to evaluate the results. RESULTS: Mean height restoration rate was 24.16%+/-1.27% in the vertebroplasty group, 24.25%+/-1.28% in the unipedicular kyphoplasty group and 37.05%+/-1.21% in the bipedicular kyphoplasty group. VAS and ODI scores improved all of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are both effective in providing pain relief and improvement in functional capacity and quality of life after the procedure, but the bipedicular kyphoplasty procedure has a further advantage in terms of height restoration when compared to unipedicular kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty procedures.",eng,0.0

Nevertheless, no data are available about the long-term consequences of cement injection into osteoporotic bone. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term tissue reaction on bone cement injected to osteoporotic bone during vertebroplasty. The thoracic spine of an 80-year-old female was explanted 3.5 years after vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate. The treatment had been performed due to painful osteoporotic compression fractures. Individual vertebral bodies were cut in axial or sagittal sections after embedding. The sections were analysed using contact radiography and staining with toluidine blue. Furthermore, selected samples were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy and micro-compted tomography (in-plane resolution 6 microm). Large amounts of newly formed callus surrounding the injected polymethylmethacrylate were detected with all imaging techniques. The callus formation almost completely filled the spaces between the vertebral endplate, the cancellous bone, and the injected polymethylmethacrylate. In trabecular bone microfractures and osteoclast lacuna were bridged or filled with newly formed bone. Nevertheless, the majority of the callus formation was found in the immediate vicinity of the polymethylmethacrylate without any obvious relationship to trabecular fractures.

This review presents an update on epidemiological data of pelvic fracture, including morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs, the role of surgery and new data on sacroplasty in acute phase management. RECENT FINDINGS: All studies underline the burden of osteoporotic pelvic fractures. Risk factors associated with these fractures are age, sex (women), and previous loss of autonomy. An increased mortality has been reported in all publications, similar to hip fracture for in-patient mortality and at 5 years of follow-up. Pelvic fractures often lead to transient or permanent autonomy loss, reflecting the high costs because of extended hospital stay, combined with nursing home requirement. However, recent studies report a decrease in the length of stay. Sacroplasty displays promising results to control pain and improve functional outcome. Early surgery begins to be discussed to also improve the outcome. SUMMARY: Pelvic fractures display all the features of severe osteoporotic fractures: increased incidence, high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs that justify awareness of the practitioner on these fractures.

LABEL is a trial determining the efficacy of pain relief of an injection of lidocaine and bupivacaine at the site of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in unblinded patients. We compared outcomes from the unblinded LABEL trial with those of blinded control patients from the lead site of the INVEST, exploring the role of blinding on the benefit of local anesthesia infusion for painful vertebral compression fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures underwent unblinded injection of lidocaine and bupivacaine at the site of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

Primary outcome measures were change in the RDQ and pain (at rest, with activity, and average 24-hour pain) at days 1 and 3 following the injection. Day 3 change in RDQ scores and change in average 24-hour pain were compared for LABEL and INVEST control patients from the lead site (n = 16).

INVEST control patients from the lead site experienced significantly greater improvement in average pain during 24 hours at days 1 (P = .03) and 3 (P = .04) and significantly greater improvements in RDQ scores at day 3 (P = .006) than patients from LABEL. CONCLUSIONS: An unblinded injection of local anesthesia is ineffective in treating pain from osteoporotic compression fractures. This suggests that factors other than local anesthesia were responsible for the observed improvement in the control group in INVEST.",eng,1.0

Kallmes,2010.0,Investigational Vertebroplasty Efficacy and Safety Trial: detailed analysis of blinding efficacy,10.1148/radiol.10100094,"PURPOSE: To perform a detailed analysis of blinding efficacy in the Investigational Vertebroplasty Efficacy and Safety Trial (INVEST) to determine any factors associated with patient unblinding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-one patients were enrolled in this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved trial and were randomized to vertebroplasty (n = 68) or control intervention (n = 63). At multiple times up to 1 month, patients guessed their treatment allocation (vertebroplasty or control) with a forced-choice response. Patients offered a confidence level (scale, 0-10) for each guess and, when possible, a reason for their guess. Univariable logistic regression models were used to test for an association between baseline characteristics of the patients and correctly guessing their randomized treatment assignment. A two-sample t test was used to determine whether change in pain score differed between patients who guessed their treatment was vertebroplasty versus those who guessed their treatment was control intervention. Qualitative reasons for guesses were tabulated according to treatment assignment and guess. RESULTS: Recruitment site was the only baseline factor significantly associated with guessing treatment correctly at 14 days (P < .01). Between the control and vertebroplasty groups, a total of 54 patients offered 64 reasons for their guesses, with 16 (25%) reasons based on procedural experiences. Control patients guessing vertebroplasty had significantly greater pain improvement at days 14 and 30 than did those guessing control (day 14, P = .02; day 30, P < .001). In the vertebroplasty group, no relationship between change in pain and patient guess was noted. CONCLUSION: A number of factors were associated with the ability of patients to guess their treatment allocation correctly-namely, treatment effect (in the control group only), study treatment site, and baseline pain duration. Procedural experiences rarely affected perceived treatment in INVEST.",eng,1.0

Boriani,2011.0,Vertebroplasty: benefits are more than risks in selected and evidence-based informed patients. A retrospective study of 59 cases,10.1007/s00586-011-1705-x,"Vertebral compression fractures represent a frequent pathology among elderly population, with potentially devastating consequences. More than 20 years have passed since percutaneous vertebroplasty was initially used in the treatment of angiomas, representing nowadays a widely used treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The authors present a retrospective review of 59 consecutive patients (in total 94 fractured levels) that underwent polymethylmethacrylate percutaneous vertebroplasty for vertebral compression fractures due to senile or secondary osteoporosis. All fractures were free from neurologic involvement and were classified as A1 type according to Magerl classification. All of patients were initially treated conservatively, by application of orthosis that allows immediate deambulation. At control, patients who complained of pain and limitation of daily activities underwent MRI. If presence of marrow signal changes, especially hypertense signal in T2-weighted images was confirmed, percutaneous vertebroplasty procedure was performed (we could call it sub-acute"" procedure). A limited group of patients that did not tolerate brace and had an insufficient pain control underwent vertebroplasty ""in acute"", few days after fracture. Immediate post-operative pain reduction and follow-up clinical outcome (estimating quality of life and residual back pain) were evaluated by means of Visual Analogue Scale, SF-36 and Oswestry Disability Index. In the immediate post-operative course a significant pain relief was found in 39 patients (66.1%), moderate pain relief in 17 (28.8%), while 3 (5.1%) did not achieve relevant pain improvement. Pain intensity and life quality was maintained within satisfactory limits after a mean follow-up of 16 months. In conclusion, percutaneous vertebroplasty is an effective and safe procedure for treating vertebral compression fractures in the elderly. It provides immediate pain relief and allows early mobilization, thus avoiding potentially severe complications related to persistent back pain and prolonged bed rest. When performed by experienced surgeon complication rate is low, representing a safe procedure, able to provide a satisfactory outcome.""",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To promote sacroplasty as a feasible treatment for sacral insufficiency fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporosis, a major cause of vertebral and sacral insufficiency fractures, is an increasingly serious problem in the elderly population. Painful sacral fractures often cause patients to be immobile, and at increased risk for comorbidities and osteoporosis progression. Currently, there is no therapy available for the treatment of these fractures. Vertebroplasty has evolved as a standard of care for treating fractures as a result of malignant and nonmalignant spinal pathology. Sacroplasty represents a reasonable adaptation of this interventional technique. METHODS: Computerized tomography (CT) guidance was used to monitor percutaneous polymethylmethacrylate injection into sacral insufficiency fractures. RESULTS: We report 2 cases of elderly patients with posttraumatic sacral insufficiency fractures, whose symptoms were completely relieved following CT-guided internal fixation by percutaneous polymethylmethacrylate injection. CONCLUSION: Under CT guidance, sacroplasty is a safe, practical, and effective solution to this underdiagnosed problem, with potential for comorbidities resulting in prolonged, costly hospital admissions for the elderly.",eng,0.0

We report our experience treating chronic vertebral fractures with vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our database identified 41 patients with symptomatic fractures more than 1 year old. These patients were categorized into subgroups determined by fracture age: 12 months 1 day-24 months (n = 16) or more than 24 months 1 day (n = 25). Changes in pain and mobility for the study group were compared with those in 49 patients with fractures less than 1 year old. RESULTS: Thirty-three (80%) of the 41 patients in the study group had improvement in pain-seven (17%) had complete and 26 (63%) had partial relief. Forty-five (92%) of the 49 control group patients had improvement in pain-24 (49%) had complete and 21 (43%) had partial relief. The number of patients achieving partial or complete relief of pain was not statistically different between groups (p > 0.05), although complete relief was significantly more frequent in the control group (p = 0.002). Twenty patients (49%) in the study group versus 34 patients (69%) in the control group had improved mobility after vertebroplasty (p = 0.047). Patients with fractures 12 months 1 day-24 months old had improvement in mobility similar to that in patients in the control group (p = 0.962). Fractures more than 24 months 1 day old were associated with significantly less improvement in mobility (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Most patients with fractures more than 1 year old will experience clinical benefit from vertebroplasty. Complete relief of pain is more likely when less mature fractures are treated.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with osteoporotic spinal compression fractures of more than 1 year's duration were treated with vertebroplasty. Changes in pain and mobility were assessed by follow-up of 1-28 months. Preprocedural MR images were reviewed using the Modic criteria and were correlated with outcomes. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (33%) had marrow edema on MRI and 30 (67%) of the 45 patients did not. All 15 of the patients with edema had clinical benefit: six patients (40%) achieved complete relief and nine (60%) experienced symptom improvement. Ten patients (67%) had improvement in mobility, and the remaining five patients (33%) had no change. Of patients with no marrow edema (n = 30), five (17%) had complete resolution of pain, 19 (63%) were improved, and six (20%) were unchanged. None had worsening of their symptoms. Mobility was improved in 17 (57%) and unchanged in 10 (33%). Mobility was diminished in three patients (10%). In two cases, impaired mobility was due to causes other than spine disorders. CONCLUSION: Most (87%) of the 45 patients with compression fractures older than 1 year derived clinical benefit from vertebroplasty irrespective of MRI findings. Although 100% of patients with bone marrow edema had clinical benefit, no direct correlation was seen between symptom resolution and the presence of edema on preprocedural MRI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with a single-level thoracolumbar compression fracture, who underwent short-segment pedicle screw fixation and CSC vertebroplasty, were included in the study. The anterior vertebral body height ratio, local kyphosis angle, and the height of the intervertebral disc adjacent to the fractured vertebra were used to evaluate the radiographic results. Complications including bone nonunion, instrument failure, cement leakage, and disc vacuum formation were also assessed. RESULTS: The patients were followed up for an average of 24.20+/-5.40 months. The relative preoperative anterior body height was 55.71+/-15.29%, which improved to 94.93+/-5.39% immediately after surgery (P<0.001), and at final follow-up showed a 6.50+/-3.89% loss of height correction (P<0.001). The mean preoperative local kyphosis angle was 22.23+/-5.65 degrees , which corrected to 2.67+/-4.43 degrees immediately after surgery (P<0.001), but reverted to 6.71+/-4.95 degrees at final follow-up, showing a 4.04+/-1.91 degrees loss of correction (P<0.001). The mean height of the intervertebral disc proximal to the fractured vertebra was 9.87+/-0.91 mm before surgery, 12.53+/-0.98 mm after operation (P<0.001), and the loss of correction at final follow-up was 2.35+/-1.15 mm with a significant difference compared to immediate postoperative values (P<0.001). Bone nonunion occurred in 7 patients, 2 patients had hardware failure, 9 patients had cement leakage, and 10 patients had disc vacuum phenomenon adjacent to the fractured vertebra. CONCLUSIONS: The patients who underwent this procedure had a loss of correction of vertebral height and local kyphosis. Complications such as bone nonunion, instrument failure, cement leakage, and disc vacuum may occur. Rapid CSC resorption accounts for these radiographic outcomes and complications.

OBJECTIVES: To synthesise the available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of vertebroplasty for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to November 2014. We also reviewed reference lists of review articles, trials and trial registries to identify any other potentially relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures of any duration and comparing vertebroplasty with placebo (sham), usual care, or any other intervention. As it is least prone to bias, vertebroplasty compared with placebo was the primary comparison. Major outcomes were mean overall pain, disability, disease-specific and overall health-related quality of life, patient-reported treatment success, new symptomatic vertebral fractures and number of other serious adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, performed 'Risk of bias' assessment and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for the main outcomes using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven RCTs and one quasi-RCT conducted in various countries were included. Two trials compared vertebroplasty with placebo (209 randomised participants), six compared vertebroplasty with usual care (566 randomised participants) and four compared vertebroplasty with kyphoplasty (545 randomised participants). Trial size varied from 34 to 404 participants, most participants were female, mean age ranged between 63.3 and 80 years, and mean symptom duration varied from a week to more than six months.Both placebo-controlled trials were judged to be at low overall risk of bias while other included trials were generally considered to be at high risk of bias across a range of criteria, most seriously due to lack of participant and study personnel blinding.Compared with placebo, there was moderate quality evidence based upon two trials that vertebroplasty provides no demonstrable benefits with respect to pain, disability, disease-specific or overall quality of life or treatment success. At one month, mean pain (on a scale 0 to 10, higher scores indicate more pain) was 5 points with placebo and 0.7 points better (1.5 better to 0.15 worse) with vertebroplasty, an absolute pain reduction of 7% (15% better to 1.5% worse) and relative reduction of 10% (21% better to 2% worse) (two trials, 201 participants). At one month, mean disability measured by the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (scale range 0 to 23, higher scores indicate worse disability) was 13.6 points in the placebo group and 1.1 points better (2.9 better to 0.8 worse) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute improvement in disability 4.8% (12.8% better to 3.3% worse), relative change 6.3% better (17.0% better to 4.4% worse) (two trials, 201 participants).At one month, disease-specific quality of life measured by the QUALEFFO (scale 0 to 100, higher scores indicating worse quality of life) was 2.4 points in the placebo group and 0.40 points worse (4.58 better to 5.38 worse) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute change: 0.4% worse (5% worse to 5% better), relative change 0.7% worse (9% worse to 8% better (based upon one trial, 73 participants). At one month overall quality of life measured by the EQ5D (0 = death to 1 = perfect health, higher scores indicate greater quality of life at one month was 0.27 points in the placebo group and 0.05 points better (0.01 worse to 0.11 better) in the vertebroplasty group, absolute improvement in quality of life 5% (1% worse to 11% better), relative change 18% better (4% worse to 39% better) (two trials, 201 participants). Based upon one trial (78 participants) at one month, 9/40 (or 225 per 1000) people perceived that treatment was successful in the placebo group compared with 12/38 (or 315 per 1000; range 150 to 664) in the vertebroplasty group, RR 1.40 (95% CI 0.67 to 2.95), absolute risk difference 9% more reported success (11% fewer to 29% more); relative change 40% more reported success (33% fewer to 195% more).Based upon moderate quality evidence from three trials (one placebo, two usual care, 281 participants) with up to 12 months follow-up, we are uncertain whether or not vertebroplasty increases the risk of new symptomatic vertebral fractures (28/143 observed in the vertebroplasty group compared with 19/138 in the control group; RR 1.47 (95% CI 0.39 to 5.50).Similary, based upon moderate quality evidence from two placebo-controlled trials (209 participants), we are uncertain about the exact risk of other adverse events (3/106 were observed in the vertebroplasty group compared with 3/103 in the placebo group; RR 1.01 (95% CI 0.21 to 4.85)). Notably, serious adverse events reported with vertebroplasty included osteomyelitis, cord compression, thecal sac injury and respiratory failure.Our subgroup analyses provided limited evidence that the effects did not differ according to duration of pain </= 6 weeks versus > 6 weeks. Including data from the six trials that compared vertebroplasty with usual care in a sensitivity analyses inconsistently altered the primary results, with all combined analyses displaying substantial to considerable heterogeneity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based upon moderate quality evidence, our review does not support a role for vertebroplasty for treating osteoporotic vertebral fractures in routine practice. We found no demonstrable clinically important benefits compared with a sham procedure and subgroup analyses indicated that results did not differ according to duration of pain </= 6 weeks versus > 6 weeks. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that open trials comparing vertebroplasty with usual care are likely to have overestimated any benefit of vertebroplasty. Correcting for these biases would likely drive any benefits observed with vertebroplasty towards the null, in keeping with findings from the placebo-controlled trials.Numerous serious adverse events have been observed following vertebroplasty. However due to the small number of events, we cannot be certain about whether or not vertebroplasty results in a clinically important increased risk of new symptomatic vertebral fractures and/or other serious adverse events. Patients should be informed about both the lack of high quality evidence supporting benefit of vertebroplasty and its potential for harm.",eng,0.0

METHODS: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants with one or two painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures that were of less than 12 months' duration and unhealed, as confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, were randomly assigned to undergo vertebroplasty or a sham procedure. Participants were stratified according to treatment center, sex, and duration of symptoms (< 6 weeks or > or = 6 weeks). Outcomes were assessed at 1 week and at 1, 3, and 6 months. The primary outcome was overall pain (on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the maximum imaginable pain) at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 78 participants were enrolled, and 71 (35 of 38 in the vertebroplasty group and 36 of 40 in the placebo group) completed the 6-month follow-up (91%). Vertebroplasty did not result in a significant advantage in any measured outcome at any time point. There were significant reductions in overall pain in both study groups at each follow-up assessment. At 3 months, the mean (+/-SD) reductions in the score for pain in the vertebroplasty and control groups were 2.6+/-2.9 and 1.9+/-3.3, respectively (adjusted between-group difference, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, -0.7 to 1.8). Similar improvements were seen in both groups with respect to pain at night and at rest, physical functioning, quality of life, and perceived improvement. Seven incident vertebral fractures (three in the vertebroplasty group and four in the placebo group) occurred during the 6-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: We found no beneficial effect of vertebroplasty as compared with a sham procedure in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, at 1 week or at 1, 3, or 6 months after treatment.

It involves radiographic-guided injection of various types of bone cement directly into the vertebral fracture site. Uncontrolled studies and two controlled quasi-experimental before-after studies comparing volunteers who were offered treatment to those who refused it, have suggested an early benefit including rapid pain relief and improved function. Conversely, several uncontrolled studies and one of the controlled before-after studies have also suggested that vertebroplasty may increase the risk of subsequent vertebral fractures, particularly in vertebrae adjacent to treated levels or if cement leakage into the adjacent disc has occurred. As yet, there are no completed randomised controlled trials of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The aims of this participant and outcome assessor-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial are to i) determine the short-term efficacy and safety (3 months) of vertebroplasty for alleviating pain and improving function for painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures; and ii) determine its medium to longer-term efficacy and safety, particularly the risk of further fracture over 2 years. DESIGN: A double-blind randomised controlled trial of 200 participants with one or two recent painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Participants will be stratified by duration of symptoms (< and >or= 6 weeks), gender and treating radiologist and randomly allocated to either the treatment or placebo. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Outcome measures include overall, night and rest pain on 10 cm visual analogue scales, quality of life measured by the Assessment of Quality of Life, Osteoporosis Quality of Life and EQ-5D questionnaires; participant perceived recovery on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from 'a great deal worse' to 'a great deal better'; disability measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire; timed 'Up and Go' test; and adverse effects. The presence of new fractures will be assessed by radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine performed at 12 and 24 months. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will be of major international importance and findings will be immediately translatable into clinical practice.",eng,1.0

Journal Article,G. Builjat; D. Perovic,2007.0,[Treatment of osteoporotic fractures of the spine],", ","Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease characterized by reduced bone strength due to the loss of bone mass, structural disproportion and reduced calcium level as well as changes in the bone structure caused by trabecular deficit. The loss of bone mass in the vertebrae leads to an increased risk of fractures. Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are two to three times more frequent than hip fractures, especially in women. Osteoporotic compressive fractures of the spine mostly occur in the middle and lower thoracic spine and in the thoracolumbar spine. Common consequences of fractures include long-term pains, decrease in the height and spinal deformity, which significantly correlate with disorders in the gait and mobility, reduced pulmonary function, loss of appetite and in the end increased mortality. Clinical picture in acute conditions manifests itself as a sudden pain in the back following minimal trauma but also often without any trauma at all. Diagnostics is based on a detailed medical history and a thorough clinical examination. Radiological diagnosis relies on standard x-rays. In case of clinical indication (differential diagnosis of tumor or spondylitis, neurological weakness) CT and/or MR imaging is performed. The approach to the treatment of osteoporotic fractures of the spine is individual and is based upon the medical history, localization of symptoms and correlation of the clinical examination with the radiological finding.

Bonnaire,2010.0,[Balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures: indications - treatment strategy - complications],10.1055/s-0030-1250379,"BACKGROUND: Considering the demographic changes in the populations of Germany and Europe as a whole, the field of geriatric traumatology is gaining more and more importance within the specialty of orthopedic and trauma surgery. The high prevalence of osteoporosis in this specific group of patients poses a special challenge, with vertebral compression fractures being the by far most common osteoporosis-related fractures. These fractures present with acute as well as chronic back pain leading to severe consequences for the affected patients. Mobility and quality of life are often heavily impaired. Furthermore, higher morbidity and mortality as well as higher risk for further fractures have been proven in these patients. METHOD: Balloon kyphoplasty has become a more frequently used therapy and is now offered broadly. This treatment addresses stable fractures not involving the posterior margin of the vertebrae. With increasing application of this surgical procedure the number of complication reports is also rising. The following article gives an overview of the technique, indications and the possible complications by giving several examples from the daily practice and reviewing the relevant literature. RESULTS: Cement leakage of the treated vertebrae is the most common complication associated with balloon kyphoplasty. In almost all cases this occurs due to too early application of the cement, not having reached its optimum in viscosity. Literature research shows a percentage rate of about 9% for cement leakage. Thus, balloon kyphoplasty provides more safety for the patient than vertebroplasty, for which cement leakage rates of up to 41% are reported. Other studies report cement leakage ratios of 4-10% for kyphoplasty versus 20-70% for vertebroplasty. Overall the percentage of cement leakage is clearly increased in osteoporotic fractures compared to non-osteoporotic fractures, with the cement leaking mainly into the spinal disc space. So far, valid data in order to further explore the consequences of intradiscal cements are lacking. Most relevant for everyday practice are cement leakages that have become symptomatic. Depending on the localisation they present with dysaesthesia culminating in radicular pain or even paraplegia. Cement leakage into vessels can, depending on the amount of cement, lead to embolism of pulmonary arteries. Complications due to the surgical technique, postoperative infections, bleeding or cardiovascular complications are rare with less than 1%. The probability for symptomatic cement leakage averages about 1.3% for balloon kyphoplasty. Another discussion, for which at present there is no evidence-based verification, is concerned with the higher risk for adjacent vertebral fractures after cement augmentation of an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. At present the degree of osteoporosis and more important the number of osteoporosis-related fractures must be the relevant predictor for adjacent fractures of neighbouring vertebrae. CONCLUSION: Balloon kyphoplasty is a highly standardised and widely used minimally invasive procedure for stabilising and augmenting painful osteoporotic fractures of the vertebral body. When surgery is indicated carefully and is carried out subtly, the risk of complications is reasonable and the outcome is promising. Viscosity of the used cement has to be adequate and it must not be inserted with too high a pressure. A causal connection between cement viscosity and risk of cement leakage has been proven in experimental studies. During application of PMMA cement a thorough fluoroscopic monitoring must take place in order to detect cement leakage at an early stage and if necessary stop application. These procedures should be reserved for clinical centres and surgeons who are able to surgically handle possible complications such as compression of the spinal cord. On the basis of our own experience we also recommend treatment in a hospital with an integrated osteoporosis centre and consecutive treatment in specialised outpatient care. Standards in primary care as well as after treatment can be introduced thereby. Also communication with practitioner concerned with outpatient care is simplified, which leads to enduring therapeutic outcome.",ger,0.0

Schulte,2010.0,[Pedicle screw augmentation from a biomechanical perspective],10.1007/s00132-010-1602-8,"Severe osteoporosis is a serious problem in the instrumentation during spine surgery. Besides kyphosis, adjacent vertebral fractures and of course pedicle screw loosening and implant pullout are frequent challenges in instrumentation of the osteoporotic spine. In addition to screw diameter and length, bone mineral density has the most important impact on the stability of a pedicle screw. In cases of severe osteoporosis cement augmentation increases the stability of a pedicle screw. Pullout force can be increased with augmentation by 96-278%. Nowadays, there are two different procedures for augmentation: cement augmentation of the vertebra before inserting the screw into the soft, fresh cement or augmentation via a perforated screw that has already been inserted.The main problem in augmentation techniques are cement leakages. In both techniques leakages may occur. The problem of leakages seems to be less severe in the augmentation technique via the perforated screw, because cement application can be stopped immediately if the onset of leakage is noticed. Even surgical revision of cement augmented screws is not a major clinical problem based on recent biomechanical studies. The revision screw can be chosen 1 mm thicker and can be cement augmented again without technical problems.",ger,0.0

To define the involvement of vertebral body innervation in pain, we collected specimens from male and female patients during percutaneous kyphoplasty, a procedure used for reconstruction of the vertebral body. Specimens were taken from 31 patients (9 men and 22 women) suffering high-intensity pain before surgery. In total, 1,876 histological preparations were obtained and analysed. Immunohistochemical techniques were used to locate the nerves in the specimens. The nerve fibres were labelled by indirect immunofluorescence with the primary antibody directed against Protein Gene Product 9.5 (PGP 9.5), a pan-neuronal marker; another primary antibody directed against type IV collagen (Col IV) was used to identify vessels and to determine their relationship with vertebral nerve fibres. The mean percentage of samples in which it was possible to identify nerve fibres was 35% in men and 29% in women. The percentages varied depending on the spinal level considered and the sex of the subject, nerve fibres being mostly present around vessels (95%). In conclusion, there is scarce innervation of the vertebral bodies, with a clear prevalence of fibres located around vessels. It seems unlikely that this pattern of vertebral body innervation is involved in vertebral pain or in pain relief following kyphoplasty.",eng,0.0

At our tertiary cancer center, over the past decade we have used vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) to treat painful VCFs. More data are needed on the treatment of VCFs in cancer patients with these techniques. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of cancer patients with painful VCFs that had been treated at our institution between January 1, 2001 and May 31, 2008. Information was collected on demographic and clinical characteristics, features of the fractures, procedural details, and complications. Pre- and post-procedural pain and related symptoms were assessed using a subset of patients who had responded to the Brief Pain Inventory and the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. RESULTS: A total of 407 cancer patients had 1,156 fractures that had been treated with VP or KP during 536 surgical procedures. Patients had an average of 2.8 fractures (range, 1-10). The majority of patients had pathologic fractures due to multiple myeloma (43%) or osteoporotic fractures (35%). Most fractures occurred in the thoracolumbar region. Adjacent-level fractures occurred in 18% of patients. Surgery provided significant relief from pain and several related symptoms. Symptomatic, serious complications requiring open surgery occurred in two cases (<0.01%) in our series. CONCLUSIONS: Our single-center experience revealed that a large number of cancer patients suffer from painful VCFs.

Mendel,2005.0,Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty: a comprehensive review,", ","Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are relatively new techniques used to treat painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). Vertebroplasty is the injection of bone cement, generally polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), into a vertebral body (VB). Kyphoplasty is the placement of balloons (called tamps"") into the VB, followed by an inflation/deflation sequence to create a cavity prior to the cement injection. These procedures are most often performed in a percutaneous fashion on an outpatient (or short stay) basis. The mechanism of action is unknown, but it is postulated that stabilization of the fracture leads to analgesia. The procedures are indicated for painful VCFs due to osteoporosis or malignancy, and for painful hemangiomas. These procedures may be efficacious in treating painful vertebral metastasis and traumatic VCFs. Much evidence favors the use of these procedures for pain associated with the aforementioned disorders. The risks associated with the procedures are low but serious complications can occur. These risks include spinal cord compression, nerve root compression, venous embolism, and pulmonary embolism including cardiovascular collapse.

The onset of their infections appeared to have preceded their vertebral body augmentation procedures and was possibly due to prior interventional procedures for histories of back pain.An 86-year-old woman had had 3 prior kyphoplasty procedures for fractures at T10, T11, and L1. She reported continued severe pain, and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging was misinterpreted for another fracture at T12, resulting in her fourth kyphoplasty. She became septic and had some improvement with antibiotics, but she declined specialty care and died. A 74-year-old man with chronic back pain had recently undergone lumbar facet joint injections. Computed tomography and subsequent bone scan found uptake at both L2 and L3. Despite abnormal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level and normal radiographic vertebral height, he underwent a vertebroplasty.

The same cement in the absence of alendronate was used as a control. The setting of the charged cement presented a maximum polymerization temperature of 44degreeC, a setting time of 24 min, a residual monomer content lower than 3 wt.%, a compressive strength of 99+/-10 MPa and an elastic modulus of 1.2+/-0.2 GPa.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients (35 vertebral bodies, 20 lumbar and 15 thoracic) were treated using RA fluoroscopy. Using a state-of-the-art flat-panel angiographer (Artis zee, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), rotational acquisitions were obtained in all patients for immediate post-procedure 2D/3D reconstructions. Pre- and postoperative back pain was assessed with the visual analog scale (VAS). Fluoroscopy time, patient radiation dose exposure, technical success, mean procedure time, mean number of rotational acquisitions and procedural complications were recorded. All features were compared with a historical cohort of patients (N = 25) who underwent PVP under CT and mobile C-arm fluoroscopy guidance. RESULTS: In all cases, safe and accurate control of the needle insertion and bone-cement injection was successfully obtained with high-quality fluoroscopy images. One cement leakage was detected in the RAU group, and two leakages were detected in the CT and C-arm fluoroscopy group. Technical features were significantly different between the two groups (RAU vs. CT): mean procedure time: 38.2 min vs. 60.2 min (p = 0.02); median fluoroscopy time: 14.58 and 4.58 min (p = 0.02); median number of rotational acquisitions: 5 vs. 10 (p = 0.02); mean patient dose: 6 +/- 1.3 mSv vs. 23 +/- 1.3 mSv (p = 0.02).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify potential risk factors. METHODS: A systematic electronic literature search was performed using the following databases: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library; the databases were searched from the earliest available records in 1966 to May 2015. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random- or fixed-effects models. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the studies, and Stata 11.0 was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The primary factors that were associated with new fractures after vertebroplasty were low bone mineral density (SMD -0.375; 95% CI -0.579 to -0.171), steroid usage (OR 2.632; 95% CI 1.399 to 4.950) and the presence of multiple treated vertebrae (OR 2.027; 95% CI 1.442 to 2.851). The data did not support that age, sex, body mass index, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage, vacuum cleft, thoracolumbar junction, cement volume, kyphosis correction, or intradiscal cement leakage could lead to infection after vertebroplasty.

Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans were analyzed in order to detect cement leakage and grade it as minor, moderate or major. RESULTS: The overall leakage rate was 50%. None of the leakages gave rise to clinical symptoms. Although balloon kyphoplasty and vertebral body stenting did not differ in terms of the leakage rate, the latter technique was associated with a lower leakage volume. The Magerl type, fracture level and use of concomitant osteosynthesis did not appear to significantly influence the leakage rate.

Gorham-Stout syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown etiology characterized by intraosseous proliferation of fibrovascular or lymphatic tissue that results in progressive osteolysis and bone destruction. It can affect any part of the skeleton and lead to pathological fractures and muscular weakness or atrophy. The literature contains few reports on the surgical management of vertebral osteolysis with risk of fracture in children. Spinal fusion is the treatment of choice. METHODS: The patient was asymptomatic until age 10 years, when he began to experience back pain. Annual magnetic resonance scans did not show progression of bone disease. Medical treatment was unsuccessful, and the visual analog scale (VAS) for lumbar back pain was 8-10. Balloon vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate filler was performed at L3 and L4, the vertebrae with an increased risk of pathological fracture. RESULTS: The postoperative course was uneventful. One month after surgery the VAS was 2-3. Four years later, the patient remains free of procedure-related complications, his clinical situation is stable, and no further low back pain has been reported. CONCLUSIONS: We report the only application to date of vertebroplasty to treat vertebral osteolysis in a pediatric patient. The outcome and possible complications of this technique remain unknown in children. The patient in the present report underwent vertebroplasty at two levels, and his progress remains satisfactory 4 years after surgery. He has not developed technical complications or changes in spinal growth.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring of the spinal cord in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The majority of clinical studies using intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring in spinal trauma focus exclusively on somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP), and there are no specific article on the use of transcranial motor-evoked potentials (TcMEP), and stimulated electromyography (SEMG) by direct stimulation of the pedicular screws in thoracolumbar burst type fractures. In addition, controversy regarding the relation between spinal cord decompression and improvement in spinal cord function in such patients remains. METHODS: Eighteen patients with thoracolumbar burst type fractures (<3 weeks) who underwent indirect posterior spinal cord decompression was carried out from 2002 to 2006. Patients were monitored intraoperatively by SSEP, TcMEP, and SEMG. Findings that suggested worsening of spinal cord function were as follows: reduction in SSEP amplitude greater than 50% or increased latency time of 10%; and increased TcMEP of 100 V. Signs of improvement were 20% increase in SSEP amplitude and 20% decrease in TcMEP stimuli intensity. Four (22%) patients presented neurologic deficit. The mean American Spinal Injury Association (1993) score for motor function was 99+/-29 (range, 90-100). The mean American Spinal Injury Association (1993) score for sensory function was 111+/-32 (range, 107-112). RESULTS: There were no significant changes in the spinal cord function during the surgical procedure, although a decrease in the mean latency could be observed after spinal cord decompression (43.21x40.86; P<0.01). Two screws triggered SEMG responses and were replaced. All cases were true negatives. CONCLUSION: No significant changes in spinal cord function (to better or worse) were found in the current series after indirect spinal cord decompression through a posterior approach in patients with mild or no neurologic deficits.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We treated 106 patients (182 PVP): 67 for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, and 39 for osteolytic metastases. The first 78 patients were treated using computed tomography (CT) combined with conventional fluoroscopy as an imaging guide (135 PVP). In 28 patients, the procedure was performed with multislice CT fluoroscopy (47 PVP). RESULTS: Partial or complete pain relief was obtained in 98% of patients within 24 h from the treatment; significant results were also obtained with regard to improvement in functional mobility and reduction of analgesic use. CT allowed the detection of cement leakage in 43.9%. Severe complications were one case of pneumothorax and two cases of symptomatic cement leakage. Mild complications included two cases of cement pulmonary embolism. During the follow-up, eight osteoporotic patients presented a new vertebral fracture, and new vertebral metastases appeared in two oncological patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our personal experience confirms the efficacy of PVP treatment for both osteoporotic and oncological patients. The use of CT guidance reduces the risk of complications in comparison with conventional fluoroscopy alone, as well as facilitates the detection of small cement leakages.","eng

Only patients over 65 years of age were included in the study. METHODS: During IX/2005 VII/2006, 45 patients with osteoporotic fractures were managed: 28 females, 17 males aged 65-85 y.o.a, their mean age was 72.6 y.o.a. The mechanisms of the injury included falls in 39 subjects, car- motocycle accidents in 5 subjects, a submerge accident in a single subject. Three patients sufferred from neurological symptoms. TI-TI0 injury was diagnosed in 8 subjects, T11-L2 in 43 subjects, L3-L5 in 5 subjects. Type A injuries prevailed--in 47 subjects, type B injury were diagnosed in 4 subjects, type C in 2 subjects. Conservative therapy was indicated in 25 subjects; transpedicular stabilization in 15 subjects, stabilization using isolated anterior approach in one patient, vertebroplasty in 5 patients. The majority of the injuries were monotraumas--31 subjects, associated traumas in 12 subjects, polytraumas in 2 subjects. RESULTS: The authors assessed data collected from 25 patients. 6 patients exited, 14 failed to turn up for their follow up examination at 12 months. GDW (Grunddeckplattenwinkel), VAS (Visual Analog Scale) and Oswestry score and complication rates were assessed. Prior to the therapy, the mean VAS score in the conservative group, surgical management and vertebroplasty groups was 7.0: 8.2 and 7.9, respectively; at 12 months the score was reduced to 3.8; 3.4 and 3.7, respectively. The Oswestry score figures in the respective treatment groups were 25.3%, 27.1% and 23.5%. There were no statistically significant differencies between the results. At the time of the injury, the mean GDW in the conservative group was -2 degrees, at 12 months -6 degrees. Prior to vertebroplasty it was +4 degrees, following the procedure +6 degrees, and at 12 months +2 degrees. Prior to surgical stabilization it was -10 degrees, postoperatively +3 degrees and at 12 months 0 degrees. An early infectious complication, a wound absces, was recorded in one patient. A late complication, implant failure, was recorded in the same patient at 6 months postoperatively.

Report of two cases,10.3171/spi.2006.5.2.168,"The authors report the use of percutaneous transpedicular vertebroplasty performed using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in two patients. These men (53 and 57 years old) had previously undergone open surgery and posterior instrumentation to treat myelomatous compression fractures. Both patients presented with acute back pain that manifested after minor activities. Kyphotic wedge fractures were diagnosed at T-1 in one case and at L-1 in the other. Both patients were treated at other hospitals with laminectomy and instrumented fusion; multiple myeloma was diagnosed after surgery. The patients experienced severe, recalcitrant, and progressive pain; on referral, they were found to have persistent kyphosis. Multiple myelomatous lesions of the spine were seen in one case and in the other the L-1 fracture represented the only site of disease. Percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed by injecting PMMA into the anterior third of the compressed vertebral body. Both patients experienced a 50% reduction in pain immediately after treatment; 3 months later both were walking and reported minimal back pain while undergoing treatment for multiple myeloma. Three years after surgery one patient reported no back pain and no progressive instability of the spine. Four years after surgery the other patient remains pain free, ambulatory, and with overall disease remission. Percutaneous vertebroplasty provided effective analgesia in these two patients with progressive back pain despite posterior stabilization. In both cases, the anterior column was effectively stabilized. A much larger operative intervention with its attendant risks of morbidity was avoided. In addition, subsequent aggressive medical treatment was well tolerated.",eng,0.0

In this modern era of evidence-based clinical practice and public health care policy and funding, an evidentiary basis is needed to continue to perform vertebral augmentation. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the latest and highest quality evidence for efficacy, safety, cost effectiveness, and potential survival benefit after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. The design, major inclusion criteria, primary outcome measures, relevant primary baseline characteristics, primary outcomes, relevant secondary outcomes, and limitations of prospective multicenter randomized sham-controlled and conservative management-controlled trials are summarized. Recently published meta-analyses or systematic reviews of efficacy that include these recent prospective studies of vertebral augmentation are examined. The highest quality procedural safety data relating to medical complications, cement leaks, and subsequent vertebral fracture are reviewed. Publications from national databases analyzing potential reduction in length of hospital stay and reduction in mortality after vertebral augmentation are presented. Finally, emerging literature assessing the potential cost-effectiveness of vertebral augmentation is considered. This narrative review will provide interventional pain physicians a summary of the latest and highest quality data published on vertebral augmentation.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed radiographs of 95 vertebral bodies treated with vertebroplasty in 60 patients with osteoporosis. Only vertebral bodies with imaging evidence of a new fracture or avascular necrosis received vertebroplasty. Images were obtained for evaluation before vertebroplasty (B), within 2 weeks after vertebroplasty (T), and after 1 year (T1). RESULTS: The mean wedge angle decreased by 5.4 degrees from B to T1. Mean of the anterior, central, and posterior heights of the fractured bodies increased by 12.6%, 9.6%, and 3.1%, respectively, from B to T1. The kyphosis angle improved by 3.2 degrees initially from B to T, but the improvement later disappeared. In 48% of these patients, a new fracture developed after vertebroplasty, and 63% of the fractures were adjacent to a vertebroplasty-treated vertebral body. CONCLUSION: The increase in height and wedge angle of the vertebral bodies generally lasted at least 1 year. Improvement in kyphosis angles was lost 1 year after vertebroplasty because new fractures occurred in 48% of these patients. Prevention of new fractures after vertebroplasty remains an important task.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and the Chinese Biomedical Database publication databases were searched using a date range of January 2008 to November 2016, for studies comparing UPKP and BPKP for the treatment of OVCFs. The clinical effectiveness was assessed by comparing perioperative outcomes (surgery time, the volume of injected cement, X-ray exposure time, and kyphotic angle reduction), clinical outcomes (visual analogue scale [VAS] for pain relief and Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] for quality of life), and surgery-related complications (cement leakage and adjacent vertebral fractures). Data were analyzed using Stata/SE11.0 software. RESULTS: Fourteen trials with 1194 patients were retrieved. The pooled results showed significant differences in surgery time (weighted mean difference [WMD] -21.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-23.57 to -19.30]; P < .001); volume of injected cement [WMD -1.90, 95% CI [-2.26 to -1.54); P < .001); and X-ray exposure time (WMD -13.66, 95%CI [-19.59 to -7.72]; P < .001) between UPKP and BPKP treatments. However, the pooled results showed no significant differences in kyphotic angle reduction, VAS in the short-term, VAS in the long-term, ODI, cement leakage, or adjacent vertebral fractures between the 2 surgical procedures. Following a subgroup analysis, the results based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicated that there were significant differences in surgery time (WMD -24.65, 95%CI [-26.53 to -22.77]; P < .001) and the volume of injected cement (WMD -1.66, 95%CI [-1.97 to -1.36]; P < .001) between UPKP and BPKP treatment procedures, respectively. The results based on RCTs indicated that there were no significant differences, either in kyphotic angle reduction or in X-ray exposure time, between the 2 surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to BPKP procedures, UPKP procedures may achieve similar clinical results in the treatment of OVCFs when assessed in terms of the pain relief, improvements in life quality, and surgery-related complications. However, UPKP procedures had a shorter operation time and volume of injected cement compared with BPKP procedures.

Jo,2007.0,Unipedicular vertebroplasty for osteoporotic compression fracture using an individualized needle insertion angle,10.1097/AJP.0b013e318154b6c3,"OBJECTIVES: In the classic transpedicular vertebroplasty, second needle placement is routinely required at the same level. However, each patient requires a different needle insertion angle (NIA) at each site. Therefore, precise NIA is required for each fractured vertebral body. In this study, we performed a unipedicular approach through an individualized NIA that had been evaluated with axial magnetic resonance imaging before vertebroplasty. METHODS: We performed percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) on 103 vertebrae in 63 consecutive patients (50 women, 13 men; mean age, 70.4 y; range, 56 to 87 y). Before PVP, we measured the NIA for each pedicle. If leakage occurred without midline cement crossover, the unipedicular approach was stopped and changed to a bipedicular approach. RESULTS: PVPs were performed from T7 to L5. We considered a successful outcome of a unipedicular approach to be when the center of vertebral body was filled with cement. Successful unipedicular PVPs were performed in 93 (90.3%) of 103 cases. Fifty-six of 63 patients were included for the pain evaluation. There was a statistically significant difference (P<0.0001) between pre-visual analog scale (VAS) (84) and post-VAS (postoperatively at 1 d-VAS: 32, postoperatively at 1 mo-VAS: 34, and postoperatively at 3 mo-VAS: 37). No statistically significant difference was found between pre-NIAs and post-NIAs. A positive correlation was found between pre-NIAs and post-NIAs. DISCUSSION: Unipedicular PVP can be performed safely, provided the operator has a thorough knowledge of the bony landmarks and the anatomy of the pedicle. A unipedicular approach could be considered first using individualized NIA at each vertebral level.",eng,0.0

METHODS: In July 2014, a comprehensive systematic computer-based online search was performed by using the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wan Fang, and the China Biological Medicine. Only prospective comparative trials (PCT) and randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared PVP with PKP were included. Trials were screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria previously formed. The Cochrane collaboration guidelines were also used to assess the quality of these included studies. The primary data of these studies [volume of the cement, postoperative vertebral height, visual analog scale (VAS) score and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score after the surgery, and so on] were carefully abstracted and processed by Revman 5.2.0 software The publication bias of the main results (cement leakage and adjacent-level fracture) were examined by Stata 12.0 (Begg and Egger test). Furthermore, the stability of the main results were also detected by sensitivity and cumulative analyses. RESULTS: Six RCT and 14 PCT studies involving 1,429 patients met our criteria and were included finally. Comparing these two methods, the PKP group took more operation time [SMD = 0.66, 95 % CI (0.28, 1.03), p = 0.0006] with higher anterior vertebral body height [SMD = 1.40, 95 % CI (0.49, 2.32), p = 0.003], greatly reduced Cobb angle in the long run [SMD = -0.61, 95 % CI (-1.04, -0.19), p = 0.005] and had lower risk of cement leakage. However, in VAS scores and ODI scores after the surgery whether for the short-term efficacy (no more than 1 week after the surgery) or long-term efficacy (more than six months), Cobb angle in the short run and new fracture in the adjacent level, no statistically differences were found between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Based on current evidence, PVP takes less time in the operation, while it has greater risk of cement leakage, was inferior in reducing Cobb angle in the long term and results in lower anterior vertebral body height after the surgery. For pain relief, which is the main desire of the patients, both procedures provide significant improvement in VAS and ODI pain scores. PVP is still an effective procedure.",eng,0.0

Nevertheless, the authors conducted a prospective study in 60 patients about the effectiveness of scintigraphy, after the conventional roentgenographic examination, as an ultimate decision maker for the identification of the levels to be treated. Seventy-one levels were radiographically and scintigraphically positive, were seen as active, and thus treated. Thirty-seven levels were radiographically negative but positive scintigraphically, were considered as imminent fractures, and thus treated. Ten levels were positive radiographically, but negative scintigraphically, and were not treated as they were considered as healed. The Oswestry Disability Score (100% = worst possible condition) improved from 38.8% +/- 39.5% at baseline, to 2.38% +/- 3.99% on the first postoperative day (p < 0.001), to 2.00% +/- 3.40% at 1 month (p < 0.001) and to 1.93% +/- 3.33% at 6 months (p < 0.001).

Our goal was to compare the survival rates, complications, lengths of hospital stay, hospital charges, discharge locations, readmissions, and repeat procedures for Medicare patients with new vertebral compression fractures that had been acutely treated with vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, or nonoperative modalities. METHODS: The 2006 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review File database was used to identify 72,693 patients with a vertebral compression fracture. Patients with a previous vertebral compression fracture, those who had had a vertebral augmentation procedure in the previous year, those with a diagnosis of malignant neoplasm, and those who had died were excluded, leaving 68,752 patients. The patients were stratified into nonoperative treatment (55.6%), vertebroplasty (11.2%), and kyphoplasty (33.2%) cohorts. Survival rates were compared with use of Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression. Results were adjusted for potential confounding variables. Secondary parameters of interest were analyzed with the chi-square test (categorical variables) and one-way analysis of variance (continuous variables), with the level of significance set at p &lt; 0.05. RESULTS: The estimated three-year survival rates were 42.3%, 49.7%, and 59.9% for the nonoperative treatment, vertebroplasty, and kyphoplasty groups, respectively. The adjusted risk of death was 20.0% lower for the kyphoplasty group than for the vertebroplasty group (hazard ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.84). Patients in the kyphoplasty group had the shortest hospital stay and the highest hospital charges and were the least likely to have had pneumonia and decubitus ulcers during the index hospitalization and at six months postoperatively. However, kyphoplasty was more likely to result in a subsequent augmentation procedure than was vertebroplasty (9.41% compared with 7.89%; p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral augmentation procedures appear to be associated with longer patient survival than nonoperative treatment does. Kyphoplasty tends to have a more striking association with survival than vertebroplasty does, but it is costly and may have a higher rate of subsequent vertebral compression fracture. These provocative findings may reflect selection bias and should be addressed in a prospective, direct comparison of methods to treat vertebral compression fractures.

Zheng,2011.0,Comparison of unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty on the stiffness and biomechanical balance of compression fractured vertebrae,10.1007/s00586-011-1744-3,"Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) has been used to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures for over 10 years; however, clinically speaking it is still controversial as to whether the use of unipedicular PKP or bipedicular PKP is best. Our study aimed to compare the different effects of unipedicular PKP and bipedicular PKP on the stiffness of compression fractured vertebral bodies (VBs), as well as to assess how cement distribution affect the bilateral biomechanical balance of the VBs. During this study, 30 thoracic VBs were compressed, creating vertebral compression fracture models; then they were augmented by unipedicular (group A and B) PKP and bipedicular (group C) PKP. In group A (unipedicular PKP), the cement was injected into one side and the augmentation was limited to the same side of the VB. In group B (unipedicular PKP), the cement was injected at only one side but the augmentation extended across the midline and filled both sides of the VB. In group C (bipedicular PKP), the cement was injected into both sides and thus achieved the bilateral augmentation. For the unipedicular PKP, the amount of cement injected was 15% of the original VB volume; while in bipedicular PKP, the amount of cement injected was a total of 20% of the original VB volume (10% was injected into each side). Using a MTS-858, we examined three phases of the VBs (intact, pre-augmented, post-augmented), by applying loads axially to the total vertebra and bilateral sides of the vertebra for each of three cycles, respectively. The changes of force and displacement were then recorded and the stiffness of the total vertebra and bilateral sides of the vertebra were calculated. For the pre-augmentation stage, the total VB stiffness of groups A, B and C significantly decreased when the compression fracture models were established (P < 0.05). After the cement augmentation (the post-augmentation stage), both groups A and B, showed that the stiffness could be restored to the initial, intact state; however, in group C, the stiffness was significantly higher than the initial, intact state (P < 0.01). The stiffness of the augmented side of group A was significantly higher than the non-augmented side (P < 0.001). In groups B and C, no significant differences were observed in the stiffness between total VB and each individual side. Thus, we can conclude that both unipedicular PKP and bipedicular PKP significantly increase the total VB stiffness. Bipedicular PKP creates stiffness uniformly across both sides of the vertebrae, while unipedicular PKP, creates a biomechanical balance depending on the distribution of cement. If bone cement is augmented only on one side, the stiffness of non-augmented side will be significantly lower than the augmented side, which might lead to an imbalance of stress on the VB. However, when cement augmentation crosses the midline, stiffness of both sides increase comparatively and biomechanical balance is thus achieved.",eng,0.0

DESIGN: Clinical randomized controlled trials of parallel group nonpharmacologic study. SETTING: Patients practised back muscle exercises in the spinal surgery department, rehabilitation department and at their residences. SUBJECTS: Osteoporotic compression fracture patients who had undergone percutaneous vertebroplasty and processed sufficient muscle strength to participate in the training were studied. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized into two groups, which were titled A and B. General postoperation therapy, including antiosteoporotic medications and education, was offered to all patients. Group B patients received additional systematic back muscle exercise. MAIN MEASURES: Both Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively at three-day, one-month, six-month, one-year and two-year follow-up. RESULTS: From January 2006 to January 2009, a total of 82 patients were assessed for eligibility, 60 patients were enrolled and randomized into two groups. Forty-two (70%) patients (20 of 30 in Group A and 22 of 30 in Group B) were successfully followed-up for two years. Systematic back muscle exercises resulted in a significant advantage in both measurements. The ODI of Group B was significantly better than Group A at the six-month, one-year and two-year follow-ups (P < 0.05). The pain level of Group B was significantly lower than in Group A at the one- and two-year follow-ups (P < 0.05). At the end of our study, the mean (SD) of the ODI in Groups A and B were 39.1 (9.14) and 23.4 (5.62); the mean (SD) of the VAS in Groups A and B were 3.4 (1.15) and 2.1 (0.84), respectively.

DESIGN: Clinical randomized controlled trials of parallel group nonpharmacologic study.
SETTING: Patients practised back muscle exercises in the spinal surgery department, rehabilitation department and at their residences.
SUBJECTS: Osteoporotic compression fracture patients who had undergone percutaneous vertebroplasty and processed sufficient muscle strength to participate in the training were studied.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized into two groups, which were titled A and B. General postoperation therapy, including antiosteoporotic medications and education, was offered to all patients. Group B patients received additional systematic back muscle exercise.
MAIN MEASURES: Both Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively at three-day, one-month, six-month, one-year and two-year follow-up.
RESULTS: From January 2006 to January 2009, a total of 82 patients were assessed for eligibility, 60 patients were enrolled and randomized into two groups. Forty-two (70%) patients (20 of 30 in Group A and 22 of 30 in Group B) were successfully followed-up for two years. Systematic back muscle exercises resulted in a significant advantage in both measurements. The ODI of Group B was significantly better than Group A at the six-month, one-year and two-year follow-ups (P<0.05). The pain level of Group B was significantly lower than in Group A at the one- and two-year follow-ups (P<0.05). At the end of our study, the mean (SD) of the ODI in Groups A and B were 39.1 (9.14) and 23.4 (5.62); the mean (SD) of the VAS in Groups A and B were 3.4 (1.15) and 2.1 (0.84), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the benefit of the exercises required at least six months to be observed; however, the favourable effects could last for two years. Therefore, systematic back muscle exercise should be recommended as one of the treatment guidelines for postpercutaneous vertebroplasty patients.",English,0.0

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess and compare the clinical outcomes and complications of unilateral and bilateral VP in treating severe vertebral compression fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Typically, VP involves cement injection by bilateral transpedicular or extrapedicular approach. Recently, several articles reported that unilateral VP can achieve comparable outcomes in most cases. However, few prospective randomized studies compared the clinical outcomes and complications in treating severe vertebral compression fractures. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with 44 severe osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) were randomly allocated into 2 groups adopting unilateral or bilateral VP. Preoperative and postoperative pain scores, back disability, and cement leakage were recorded and compared. RESULTS: Significant improvement on the visual analog scale and Oswestry disability index scores were noted in each group, and there were no significant differences between the 2 groups. Cement leakage was seen more in bilateral VP. CONCLUSIONS: Severe OVCFs should be candidates for VP. The unilateral VP can get the same clinical results with fewer complications compared with the bilateral VP.",eng,1.0

Kyphoplasty (KP) is proved to be efficacious for pain relief and vertebral height restoration in chronic OVCFs, but there is still no data available about the clinical and radiographical outcomes compared by unipedicular and bipedicular KP in treating chronic painful OVCFs. PURPOSE: To assess the clinical and radiographical outcomes in treating chronic painful OVCFs compared by unipedicular and bipedicular KP. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with a total of sixty-six chronic painful OVCFs were enroled in our study. They were randomly allocated into two groups: group I (n=33) was treated with unipedicular KP and group II (n=25) with bipedicular KP. The operation times for each group were recorded and compared. Preoperative and postoperative of visual analogue scores (VAS) and oswestry disability index (ODI) scores were compared 2 weeks after surgery within each group and between groups. The radiographic outcomes were evaluated by the restoration rate (RR) in the most compressed point of the vertebral bodies. RESULTS: Significant improvement on the VAS, ODI scores and RR was noted in each group (p<0.001), and there is no significant difference existing in clinical outcomes between the two groups. The mean operation time for each vertebra in group I was significantly shorter than in group II (p<0.001). But the RR in group II was higher than in group I (p=0.041). CONCLUSION: Both unipedicular kyphoplasty and bipedicular kyphoplasty can achieve satisfactory clinical and radiographic outcomes in treating the chronic painful OVCFs and the operation time is shorter in unipedicular kyphoplasty.

The clinical efficacies of these three treatments were evaluated by comparing their PMMA cement leakages, cement patterns, height restoration percentages, wedge angles, visual analogue scales (VAS), and oswestry disability index (ODI) at the pre- and post-operative time points. 6.67%, 3.33%, and 0% of patients had PMMA leakage in PVP, PKP, and PMCP groups, respectively. Three (solid, trabecular, and mixed patterns), two (solid and mixed patterns), and one (mixed patterns) types of cement patterns were observed in PVP, PKP, and PMCP groups, respectively. PKP and PMCP treatments had better height restoration ability than PVP treatment. PVP, PKP, and PMCP treatments had significant and similar ability in pain relief and functional recovery ability for the treatment of VCFs.

This study was designed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic results following posterior short-segment instrumentation and limited segmental decompression supplemented with vertebroplasty with calcium sulphate and intermediate screws for patients with severe thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures of LSC point 7 or more underwent this procedure. The average follow-up was 27.5 months. Demographic data, radiographic parameters, neurologic function, clinical outcomes and treatment-related complications were prospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Loss of vertebral body height and segmental kyphosis was 55.3 % and 20.2 degrees before surgery, which significantly improved to 12.2 % and 5.4 degrees at the final follow-up, respectively. Loss of kyphosis correction was 2.2 degrees . The preoperative canal encroachment was 49 % that significantly improved to 8.8 %. The preoperative pain and function level showed a mean VAS score of 9.2 and ODI of 89.9 % that improved to 1.4 and 12.9 % at the final follow-up, respectively. No implant failure was observed in this series, and cement leakage occurred in two cases without clinical implications. CONCLUSIONS: Excellent reduction and maintenance of thoracolumbar burst fractures can be achieved with short-segment pedicle instrumentation supplemented with anterior column reconstruction and intermediate screws.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and radiographical outcomes in treating chronic painful OVCFs compared by unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty (KP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: OVCFs commonly occur in aged people and as many as one-third of them progress to chronic pain. Our previous research has proved that unipedicular and bipedicular KP can achieve comparable radiographical and clinical results in early stage. To give a medium-term and long-term assessment, we completed the comparison of outcomes 6 months and 2 years after surgery. METHODS: Fifty patients with a total of 56 chronic painful OVCFs completed the follow-ups of 2 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years after surgery. Group I (n=27) were treated with unipedicular KP and group II (n=23) with bipedicular KP. Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale and Oswestry disability index scores were compared within each group and between groups.

However, a risk of cement leakage and further neurological damage remains during and after PKP, especially in chronic osteoporotic stage III Kummell's disease with severe spinal canal stenosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of PKP for the treatment of chronic osteoporotic stage III Kummell's disease with severe spinal canal stenosis. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective evaluation of postoperative radiographs. SETTING: Pain management clinic. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 9 patients with 11 levels managed with PKP for chronic osteoporotic stage III Kummell's disease with severe spinal canal stenosis. Clinical and radiological outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Substantial pain relief was attained in all the patients. Both visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores improved significantly from pre- to post-operation (P < 0.05), and remained unchanged at every follow-up. No neurological deterioration was found. Postoperatively, the anterior and midline vertebral body heights were significantly corrected (P < 0.05), and were sustained at the final follow-up. Similar results were seen in the correction of kyphotic angle. Neither cement leakage into the spinal canal nor further dislodging of the posterior vertebral fragments occurred. Two cases experienced subsequent fractures with one having a second PKP and the other being treated conservatively. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study of 9 cases with 11 levels due partly to the rarity of the disorder.

The anterior wall of the vertebral canal is separated from the posterior wall of the vertebral body on the lateral X-ray image. This study was designed to determine the sagittal distance between the anterior border of the vertebral canal and the posterior border of the vertebral body (DBCV) and to analyze the potential role of DBCV in the estimation of cement leakage during percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) or percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). METHODS: We retrospectively recruited 233 patients who had osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and were treated with PVP or PKP. Computed tomography images of T11-L2 normal vertebrae were measured to obtain DBCV. The distance from cement to the posterior wall of the vertebral body (DCPW) of thoracolumbar vertebrae was measured from C-arm images. The selected vertebrae were divided into two groups according to DCPW, with the fracture levels, fracture grades and leakage rates of the two groups compared. A relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to determine whether the DCPW difference can be used to estimate the degree of cement leakage. The data were processed by statistical software SPSS version 21.0 using independent sample t-test and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: The maximum DBCV was 6.40 mm and the average DBCV was 3.74 +/- 0.95 mm. DBCV appeared to be longer in males than in females, but the difference was not statistically significant. The average DCPW of type-B leakage vertebrae (2.59 +/- 1.20 mm) was shorter than that of other vertebrae (7.83 +/- 2.38 mm, P < 0.001). The leakage rate of group DCPW </=6.40 mm was lower than that of group DCPW >6.40 mm for type-C and type-S, but much higher for type-B. ROC curve revealed that DCPW only has a predictive value for type-B leakage (area under the curve: 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.95-0.99, P < 0.001), and when the cut-off value was 4.05 mm, the diagnostic sensitivity and the specificity were 94.87% and 93.02%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Depression of the thoracolumbar posterior vertebral body may be informative for the estimation of cement location on C-arm images. To reduce type-B leakage, DCPW should be made longer than DBCV on C-arm images for safety during PVP or PKP.",eng,0.0

To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been no mention in any literature regarding the use of percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of spinal burst fracture. METHODS: A preliminary study was conducted on 6 patients with traumatic burst fractures of vertebrae treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty starting in June 2000. Fractures involving the anterior and middle columns of the vertebrae and the canal were mildly compressed by the retropulsed bone fragment. However, there was no obvious neurologic deficit in these patients. They initially underwent conservative treatment and thoracolumbar spinal orthosis (TLSO) brace for at least 3 months, but the intractable pain caused patients to be bedridden for prolonged periods of time and limited daily activity. As a result, the patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) for treatment of spinal burst fractures. RESULTS: Six male patients (mean age: 38.2) who suffered from burst fractures of vertebrae with disabling back pain refractory to analgesic therapy and TLSO brace were treated in this study. The duration of conservation treatment period was 3.5 months to 8 months (mean: 5.2 months). There was no motility. However, 4 vertebrae (66.7%), on radiographs revealed evidence of PMMA leakage through the endplate fracture site into either the disc space or the paravertebral space, without any evident clinical symptoms. No intracanal leakage was seen, and no patient needed a secondary surgical intervention. Pain decreased from 84.3 +/- 5.4 mm at baseline to 34.7 +/- 4.4 mm at the third postoperative day, 30.2 +/- 5.8 at 3 months and 24 +/- 3.5 mm at 12 months. The reduction in pain from baseline to the 3-day and 3 month mark was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The mobility was at least 2 levels of improvement (mean improvement 2.7 points) at 12-months postoperative. CONCLUSION: In highly selective patients, percutaneous vertebroplasty can be an alternative method for the treatment of spinal burst fractures and the prevention of complications from major surgical procedures. However, this procedure still has potential risks and should be employed with extreme caution to prevent extravasation of PMMA into the spinal canal.",eng,0.0

METHODS: The technique was used on 50 patients with 86 painful vertebral fractures, all of which had failed to respond to earlier conservative medical treatment. The technique involves percutaneous puncture of the involved vertebra via a transpedical approach followed by injection of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) into the compressed vertebra. Patients were asked to quantity their degree of pain on Huskisson's visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess the clinical symptoms and surgical results. RESULTS: The procedures were technically successful in all patients, and no complications relating to either the anesthesia or the surgical procedure were reported. The quantity of PMMA injected per vertebral body varied from 2.5 to 12 ml according to both the position of the damaged vertebra(e) and the severity of the compression fracture. Pain, as assessed on the Huskisson's VAS, decreased from 82 +/- 15 mm at the baseline to 37 +/- 22 mm on the first postoperative day, and 32 +/- 19 mm at 1 month. Reductions in pain from the baseline to the first day and to 1 month were both statistically significant (p < 0.05). All patients were able to return to their previous activity and quality of life. CONCLUSION: Through the expertise and attention of experienced surgeons, percutaneous vertebroplasty appears to provide a very good surgical choice for patients with vertebral compression fractures, as this surgical procedure is able to eliminate the risk of major spinal surgery, and through prompt pain relief, may provide early mobilization and rehabilitation for elderly polymorbid patients.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To describe an extremely rare case of combined extraforaminal and intradiscal cement leakage in different vertebral levels following percutaneous vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cement leaks in vertebroplasty are relatively common but generally not clinically significant. To our knowledge, this is the first report of extraforaminal cement leakage inducing radiculopathy combined with intradiscal cement leakage evoking acute adjacent compression fracture. METHODS: A 78-year-old woman with L2 and L5 osteoporotic compression fractures received vertebroplasty. Two weeks after surgery, the patient presented severe low back pain radiating to the right thigh, with associated weakness and numbness in the right thigh and lower leg. Roentgenographic images revealed cement leakage into the right extraforamen of L2-L3 as well as leakage into L4-L5 disc with acute adjacent compression fracture of L4. RESULTS: Surgical intervention was required to relieve discomfort. One-stage posterior approach was performed: right L2-L3 intertransverse process approach with removal of extraforaminal leaked cement and posterior instrumentation from L3-L5 and posterior fusion. The severe low back pain, leg pain, and neurologic deficit associated weakness all improved after surgery. CONCLUSION: Although considered a minimally invasive procedure, percutaneous vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate is not risk free. Intractable neurologic complications can occur if it is not performed by experienced physicians under appropriate indications and cautionary safeguards.",eng,1.0

The operation time, injected cement volume, bone mineral density, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, vertebral height, and kyphotic angle were recorded. The secondary increment of the kyphotic angle was calculated, and correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: The bone mineral density, the postoperative kyphotic angle and the vertebral midline height were significantly correlated to the secondary increment of the kyphotic angle. CONCLUSION: Large postoperative kyphotic angle, poor postoperative recovery of the vertebral midline height, and low bone mineral density are all risk factors of secondary increment of the kyphotic angle.",chi,0.0

We included 31 patients in this retrospective study who were treated with PMMA from 2003 to 2005 for intractable pain due to metastatic spine lesions. The types of cancer (and numbers of patients) included: lung cancer (9), breast cancer (7), gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers (5), hepatobiliary malignancies (3), and other types of cancer (7). All patients received vertebroplasty, resulting in 41 treatments (16 in thoracic, 25 in lumbar spine). Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain were measured in all patients. Image studies including contrast-enhanced MRI were performed in all patients. Results showed characteristic metastatic lesions. Suspicious lesions were further confirmed as malignant by a bone scan, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and pathological exam. Vertebroplasty resulted in complete or partial pain relief in 29 patients (95%), and provided no pain relief in 2 patients (5%). The mean preoperative VAS score of 8.9 (+/-0.93) was higher than the mean postoperative VAS score (2.6+/-1.71). Metastatic spine lesions were most common in lung and breast cancer patients and these lesions were located more often on segments T12 to L2 (53.6%). Patients with malignancy of hepatobiliary origin did not show improvement in pain scores as dramatically as patients with other types of malignancies, although only a few cases were included in this study. No patients experienced worsening of symptoms or suffered from vertebroplasty complications. We conclude that vertebroplasty is a safe, effective, and simple treatment for the management of intractable spinal pain due to metastases.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Between September 2009 and September 2010, 16 patients with thoracolumbar metastatic tumors underwent improved PKP. Of 16 patients, 7 were male and 9 were female with an average age of 64.5 years (range, 60-73 years). All patients had vertebral metastasis tumor. The disease duration was 3-6 months with an average of 4 months. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 8.9 +/- 0.8. No spinal cord compression and nerve root compression was observed. The involved vertebrae included T7 in 1 case, T8 in 1, T12 in 1, L2 in 2, L3 in 2, L4 in 3, T1,2 in 1, T3,4 in 1, T7,8 in 1, T11, 12 in 1, T7-L1 in 1, and T12-L4 in 1. Nine patients had vertebral compression fracture with a vertebral compression rate below 75%. RESULTS: All patients were successfully performed PKP. There was no serious adverse reactions in cardiopulmonary and brain vascular systems and no perioperative death. The biopsy results showed that all were metastatic adenocarcinoma. All patients were followed up 9-18 months (mean, 14 months). Complete pain relief was achieved in 14 cases and partial relief in 2 cases 6 months after operation according to World Health Organization criterion, with a pain-relief rate of 87.5%. The VAS score was 1.8 +/- 0.6 at 6 months postoperatively, showing significant difference when compared with the preoperative score (P < 0.05). Two patients had cement leakages in 3 vertebrae with no symptoms at 6 months postoperatively. During follow-up, 12 patients died and the others survived with tumor. CONCLUSION: For patients with thoracolumbar metastatic tumors who can not tolerate anesthesia and open operation, improved PKP has the advantages such as minimal invasion, high diagnostic rate, and early improvement of pain in the biopsy and treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To examine and compare the safety and long-term radiographic and clinical effects of unilateral or bilateral balloon kyphoplasty to treat multilevel symptomatic vertebral compression fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Typically, balloon kyphoplasty involves placement of inflatable bone tamp via a bilateral transpedicular or extrapedicular approach. Recently, several articles reported unilateral kyphoplasty with comparable outcomes. However, few prospective randomized study comparing the radiographic and clinical outcomes using unilateral and bilateral approaches was reported. METHODS.: Forty-nine patients with 114 Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were randomly allocated into two groups adopting unilateral or bilateral balloon kyphoplasty. Preoperative and postoperative pain scores, back disability, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scores were compared with at least a 2-year follow-up. Vertebral body height and vertebral body kyphotic angle from this cohort were analyzed before surgery, after surgery, and at final follow-up. RESULTS: Both unilateral and bilateral balloon kyphoplasty resulted in significant pain reduction and back dysfunction improvement and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Quality of life assessment using 36-Item Short Form Health Survey recorded marked and significant improvements in all mean subscale scores except general health and social function. Regarding the pain reduction, back dysfunction, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scores, no significant difference existed between two groups. Significant increases of anterior and middle vertebral heights were recorded for both groups after surgery and maintained for the period of follow-up. The mean correction of vertebral body kyphotic angle was about 7 degrees in both groups. Asymptomatic cement extravasation occurred in six of 49 of patients, and three patients developed additional fractures at untreated levels during the period of follow-up.

METHODS: From May 2002 to June 2007, 41 consecutive patients with painful multi-vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures underwent unilateral or bilateral kyphoplasty. The unilateral group included 3 male and 14 female with an average age of 70.4 (range 52 to 91 years old). The bilateral group included 4 men and 20 women with an average age of 72.4 (range 61 to 87 years old). Each procedure included insertion of inflatable balloon, fracture reduction and cement filling under C""-arm monitoring. Preoperative and postoperative pain level, SF-36 score, radiographs and complications were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: All 41 patients tolerated the operation well. The mean operation time were (86 +/- 32) min and (120 +/- 26) min for unilateral and bilateral groups respectively; the mean volume of cement injected into one level were (3.9 +/- 1.6) ml and (5.4 +/- 2.1) ml for unilateral and bilateral groups respectively. The mean follow-up were (32.5 +/- 17.2) months and (30.7 +/- 14.3) months for unilateral and bilateral groups respectively.

Chen,2011.0,Repeated percutaneous vertebroplasty for refracture of cemented vertebrae,10.1007/s00402-010-1236-7,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is an efficient procedure to treat painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. However, refracture of cemented vertebrae occurs rarely after percutaneous vertebroplasty. This study was undertaken to investigate the incidence, characteristics, predisposing factors, and mistakes in technique associated with refracture of the same vertebra after percutaneous vertebroplasty. METHODS: From 2001 to 2008, PVP with bone cement (polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA) was carried out in 2,291 patients with 2,581 PVP procedures. The etiologies including pathologic fracture (including metastasis, osteolytic tumor, hemangioma) in 299 patients, infectious spondylitis in 4 patients and osteoporotic compression fractures in 1,988 patients. A total of 1,988 patients with 2,110 VCFs underwent PVP with PMMA cement after failing conservative treatment for at least 3 months. New recollapsed vertebral fractures were diagnosed as recurrent intractable back pain, postoperatively correlated with serial plain radiography and MR image. Clinical parameters such as age, gender, body mass index, and fracture-free interval (from the date of the initial intervention with percutaneous vertebroplasty to the diagnosis of subsequent fractures) were recorded. Parameters related to imaging and technical characteristics, including the amount of bone cement injected per procedure, level, the presence of osteonecrosis in the vertebral body, and the surgical approach (uni- or bipedicles), the restoration of kyphosis angle and height of the anterior border of the collapsed vertebral body, and any leakage of cement into the disk space were also recorded. RESULTS: In a 2-year follow-up, 1,800 patients with 1,820 VCFs were retrospectively reviewed and 10 patients with 10 VCFs developed refracture of the same vertebra after PVP with an incidence rate of 0.56% (10 in 1,800). The mean age of the ten patients (nine females and one male) was 79.6 years, and the mean BMI is 22.3. Levels of refracture after PVP were all located in the thoracolumbar junction (T12-L2): three in T12; four in L1; and three in L2. Osteonecrosis was present in all patients and intradiscal cement leakage was noted in five patients. The mean of the restoration of kyphosis angle was 7.7 degrees and height of the anterior border was 26%. Osteonecrosis, greater anterior vertebral height restoration, lesser kyphosis angle correction and cystic filling pattern were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that larger height restoration and solid lump filling cement are risk factors of refracture of cemented vertebral bodies. Symmetric cement distribution and fluid aspiration would be the potential ways to avoid refracture of cemented vertebral bodies.",eng,1.0

Chen,2012.0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty for pathological vertebral compression fractures secondary to multiple myeloma,10.1007/s00402-012-1474-y,"BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures are common in multiple myeloma. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is used to stabilize vertebral collapse and treat the pain. The major technical drawbacks of percutaneous vertebroplasty are the potential for neural comprise and pulmonary embolism of cement from leakage of polymethylmethacrylate into epidural space and perivertebral veins. We have retrospectively evaluated the safety and complication of percutaneous vertebroplasty in the vertebral compression fractures resulting from multiple myeloma. METHODS: From August 2003 to July 2008, we describe 24 patients with multiple myeloma who were treated for vertebral compression fractures with percutaneous vertebroplasty to a total of 36 vertebrae. There were 4 male and 20 female patients with an average age of 67 (range 54-81 years). The pain symptoms were measured on a visual analog pain scale and quality of life as measured by the physical component summary scale of the Short Form- 36 before operation and at 24 h, at 3 months and at 1 year following vertebroplasty. Radiography was reviewed for evidence of cement leakage and pulmonary complication. RESULTS: The mean visual analog pain scale decreased from a preoperative value of 9.0-3.8 at 24 h following operation and SF-36 score improved from 22.1 to 41.8. Of the twenty-four patients, four had cement leakage (2 leak through inferior endplate into disc, 2 leak into perivertebral vessels). There were no intra-postoperative neurologic or pulmonary complications. Eight patients died 2-18 months post-operatively due to multiple myeloma-related organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, vertebroplasty significantly improved pain scores and function and, thereby, the quality of life. There were no major procedure-related complications in this study. Direct cytotoxic effect, polymerization and biomechanical microfractures stabilizer of polymethylmethacrylate play multiple roles in pain relief. In multiple myeloma, when pathological spinal compression fractures cause intractable pain and are unresponsive to conservative treatment, vertebroplasty remains the best option for pain relief and is effective in increasing quality of life.",eng,1.0

We suspected that a compression fracture with vacuum cleft can be treated successfully with a unipedicle approach. We retrospectively reviewed 27 patients with an osteoporotic compression fracture with intraosseous vacuum cleft. The patients received percutaneous vertebroplasty with bone cement (polymethylmethacrylate) augmentation. Bone cement was injected into the fractured vertebral body through only one cannula in the selected pedicle. Cement filling, vertebral height restoration, and relief of pain were evaluated. The minimum followup was 12 months (range, 12-30 months). Twenty six of 27 patients had adequate filling. Average vertebral height restoration was 27%. The patients' visual analog scale improved an average of 40 points. Percutaneous transpedicle vertebroplasty is effective for treating osteoporotic compression fractures with intraosseous vacuum clefts. Because of the preexistent cleft, the procedure can be done successfully via a unipedicle approach. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic study, Level IV (case series--no, or historical, control group).

Journal Article,L. H. Chen; P. L. Lai; W. J. Chen,2011.0,Current status of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic compression fracture,", ","Vertebral compression fracture is the most common complication of osteoporosis. It may result in persistent severe pain and limited mobility, and significantly impact the quality of life. Conservative therapy using external bracing, bed rest and analgesics is necessary for pain control in these patients. However, some patients may experience protracted or ongoing pain even with these measures. Surgical treatment is indicated when conservative treatment fails, or in patients with spinal instability or neurologic deficit. Elderly patients often have comorbilities, and because of osteoporosis, high risk of postoperative complications such as implant loosening, and further adjacent fractures. Vertebroplasty involves a percutaneous injection of bone cement into the collapsed vertebrae under fluroscopic imaging guidance. It was first reported in 1987 for the management of a painful, aggressive hemangioma of a vertebral body. Since then, vertebroplasty has been widely accepted for the treatment of vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures without neurological damage.

This investigation assesses the efficacy and safety of PV for refractory pain owing to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. METHODS: A retrospective investigation of PV was conducted with a minimal of 1 year follow up. PV with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was performed on 75 patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures that responded poorly to the conservative therapy. Patients were asked to quantify their degree of pain using Huskisson's visual analogue scale to assess the clinical results. RESULTS: Eighty-seven vertebrae treated using PV in 70 patients were evaluated with a minimal of 1 year follow up. Pain, as assessed on the VAS, decreased from 80+/-16 mm before PV to 36+/-28 mm at 1 month after PV and 30+/-19 mm at the most recent follow up. The reduction in pain from the baseline to 1 month (p=0.031) and to final follow up (p=0.023) were both statistically significant. Sixty-two patients (85.5%) quickly returned to their pre-injury activity level and achieved better quality of life.

Our aim is to integrate the evidence to provide hierarchies of the comparative efficacy measured by the change of VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) and tolerability measured by incidence of new fractures and risk of all-cause discontinuation on three treatments (percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP)balloon kyphoplasty (BK) and conservative treatment (CT)). METHODS: We performed a Bayesian-framework network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare three treatments for the old people with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. The eligible RCTs were identified by searching Amed, British Nursing Index, Embase, Pubmed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Google scholar, SIGLE, the National Technical Information Service, the National Research Register (UK) and the Current Controlled Trials databases. Data from three outcomes (e.g. VAS, risk of all-cause discontinuation and incidence of new fractures) were independently extracted by two authors. RESULTS: A total of five RCTs were finally included into this article. PVP and BK significantly decreased VAS when compared with CT. BK had a significantly lower risk of all-cause discontinuation contrast to CT. Three treatments (BK, PVP and CT) had no significant differences in the incidence of new fractures. CONCLUSIONS: PVP may be the best way to relieve pain, CT might lead to the lowest incidence of new fractures and BK might had the lowest risk of all-cause discontinuation in old people with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between cement leakage into the disk during initial PV and development of subsequent new adjacent VCF. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cement leakage outside the vertebral body during PV has been reported and usually responds to conservative treatment. Sometimes bone cement may leak into the intervertebral disk and result in painful new adjacent VCF that usually requires another PV for pain relief. METHODS: From January 2002 to December 2002, a total of 106 consecutive patients underwent PVs for osteoporotic VCFs. The risk of new fractures of adjacent vertebral bodies, the amount of cement injection, and the duration of development of new adjacent fractures in relation to cement leakage into the disk were retrospectively assessed and statistically compared. RESULTS: New adjacent VCFs occurred in 20 (18.9%) of 106 patients at 22 adjacent vertebral bodies after PVs during at least 24 months of follow-up. The difference in number of new adjacent fractures between both patients and vertebral bodies with cement leakage and those without leakage into the disk were statistically significant (P<0.001 and P<0.001). Amounts of cement injected and duration to development of new adjacent fractures differed between patients with or without cement leakage (P<0.001 and P=0.005, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PV is a simple and effective, but not risk-free or complication-free procedure for the treatment of osteoporotic VCF. Patients undergoing PV should be informed of the possibility of new adjacent fractures and the higher risk if cement leaks into the disk.",eng,1.0

METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed of cases of osteoporotic patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-proven acute vertebral fractures between 2001 and 2007. Osteoporotic patients were investigated as determined by pre-operative MRI with subsequent adjacent fracture of the cemented vertebrae and for the possibility of anti-osteoporotic therapy decreasing the progression of collapse after a minimum of 6 months follow-up. All associated co-morbidities were recorded, as well as the use of anti-osteoporotic drugs (i.e., bisphosphonate, raloxifen, calcitonin, and teriparatide). Cox regression analysis was also performed. RESULTS: The 192 vertebral fractured patients who underwent vertebroplasty and anti-osteoporotic therapy had a mean age of 74.40 +/- 6.41. The basic characteristics of patients with and without adjacent fracture differed in age, body mass index, rheumatoid arthritis, and use of glucocorticoids and anti-osteoporotic drugs (Table 1). Using the Kaplan-Meier curve, anti-osteoporotic therapy after vertebroplasty had a significant effect on adjacent fracture (p = 0.037, by log rank text). After adjusting for potential confounders, patients with anti-osteoporotic therapy still had a lower adjacent fracture rate than patients without anti-osteoporotic therapy (p = 0.006; HR: 2.137, 95 % CI: 1.1238-3.690).

OUTCOME MEASURES: Back pain was measured using the visual analog scale (VAS). The post-vertebroplasty anterior vertebral height and local kyphotic angle were used as the radiologic parameters. Intraoperative procedure time and fluoroscopy shots and postoperative complication were also evaluated.
METHODS: The stylus of the first needle was inserted into the trocar to push the cement out of the trocar. The stylus was removed, a small diameter K-wire was inserted into the trocar, and the trocar was then removed. A second (new) trocar was inserted into the vertebral body following the track of the K-wire. When the new trocar reached the posterior 1/4 of the vertebral body, the K-wire was removed, the stylus was inserted, and the new needle was advanced to the anterior third of the vertebra. Cement was then injected into the new area until the filling was adequate.
RESULTS: The immediate post-vertebroplasty anterior vertebral height was 23.31+/-1.95 mm, changed to 22.20+/-3.72 mm at final follow-up. The VAS decreased from a mean of 8.4 before vertebroplasty to 1.6 at the final follow-up. The follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 15 months (mean 12.6 months). There was no case of recollapse of the cemented vertebrae and no procedure-related complications. The procedure time of historical controls was 153.5 seconds, which reduced to 47.9 seconds by using this technique. The fluoroscopy shots of historical controls were 9.7 shots, which reduced to 2 shots by using this technique.
CONCLUSIONS: This report suggests that Kirschner wire-guided technique for inserting a second needle during vertebroplasty could make the procedure simple, effective, and, most importantly, reduce the procedure time and radiation exposure.

Hsu,2012.0,Repeat needle insertion in vertebroplasty to prevent re-collapse of the treated vertebrae,10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.02.034,"PURPOSE: Patients with un-relieved pain after vertebroplasty due to re-collapse of the cemented vertebrae have been reported. Here we report a technique of vertebroplasty that can reduce the incidence of re-collapse at the cemented vertebrae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2002 and September 2008, 134 patients with 205 painful vertebral compression fractures underwent vertebroplasty in our institutes. The indication of using this technique was unfilled area more than 25% of the vertebral body height in lateral radiograph. The vertebroplasty procedure was performed according to the technique described by Jensen. If the unfilled area were more than 25% of the vertebral body height in lateral radiograph, another needle would be inserted aiming at the unfilled area. As outcome measurement, a visual analog scale with 10 divisions and plain radiographs (to measure the anterior vertebral body height of cemented vertebrae) were used. RESULTS: Thirteen vertebrae were treated with this technique. The mean age was 74.4 years. The immediate post-vertebroplasty anterior vertebral height was 24.92+/-3.59 mm, changed to 23.52+/-3.54 mm at final follow-up. The visual analog scale decreased from a mean of 8.7 before vertebroplasty to 2.3 at final follow-up. The follow-up duration ranged from 15 to 38 months (mean 18.5 months). There was no case of re-collapse of the cemented vertebrae, and no procedure-related complications. CONCLUSION: In the treatment of vertebral compression fractures by percutaneous vertebroplasty, repeat needle insertion to the unfilled area may be helpful to decrease the incidence of re-collapse of cemented vertebrae if the unfilled area is more than 25% of the vertebral body height in lateral radiograph.",eng,0.0

Hsu,2011.0,The value of dynamic radiographs in diagnosing painful vertebrae in osteoporotic compression fractures,10.3174/ajnr.A2233,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many authors have reported the increase in vertebral body height after vertebroplasty; if the fractured vertebrae are mobile, we should be able to demonstrate their mobility in radiographs. The purpose of this study was to discover the diagnostic value of dynamic radiographs and the percentage of mobile vertebrae in painful VCFs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September 2005 to September 2008, 105 patients underwent surgery to treat 144 painful osteoporotic VCFs. The indications for surgery were severe pain and MR imaging-confirmed active edematous lesions. Preoperative sitting lateral radiographs of the fractured vertebrae were compared with supine cross-table (with a bolster beneath) lateral radiographs to determine the presence or absence of dynamic mobility. Kyphotic angle and anterior vertebral body height were measured. RESULTS: The patients' ages ranged from 62 to 90 years. There were 19 men and 86 women. The total number of mobile VCFs was 126 (87.5%). One hundred four (99%) patients had at least 1 mobile VCF. The average anterior vertebral height in sitting lateral radiographs was 13.53 +/- 6.80 mm and increased to 22.01 +/- 6.13 mm in supine cross-table with bolster lateral radiographs. The average vertebral body height increase was 8.48 +/- 5.36 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic (sitting and supine with bolster) radiographs can be valuable in diagnosing painful vertebrae in VCFs.

OBJECTIVES: To report 1 case of intradural cement leakage caused by percutaneous vertebroplasty with polymethyl methacrylate. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cement leakage is not a rare complication of vertebroplasty. But intradural cement leakage is rare. We herein report a rare but devastating complication of vertebroplasty. METHODS: A 90-year-old woman with a T12 and L1 osteoporotic compression fracture underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty using polymethyl methacrylate at local hospital. A literature search was performed to assess complications of vertebroplasty. RESULTS: She was transferred to our hospital due to abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed distended abdomen with local tenderness and weakness of both legs (muscle power: Grade 2). Plain radiograph of abdomen showed ileus and intradural cement leakage. Conservative treatment with nasogastric decompression was done, and her abdominal pain subsided 1 week later. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty with polymethyl methacrylate is relatively safe, but it still should be proceeded under careful safeguard. The needle tip should not cross the medial border of the pedicle on the anteroposterior view before it has crossed the posterior cortex of the vertebral body on the lateral view. Good quality of image monitoring and clear visualization of cement should be helpful to prevent complications.",eng,1.0

Kuo,2015.0,Intracranial Hypotension as A Rare Complication of Vertebroplasty: A Case Report,", ","BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fracture is one of the frequent complications of osteoporosis. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has been applied in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, multiple myelomas and vertebral metastatic lesions. Complications of the procedure include bleeding at the puncture site, local infection, cement leakage in the vertebral canal and intervertebral foramen. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage after the procedure was rarely mentioned in the literature. CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old healthy female patient has no neurologic or orthopedic illness before. She suffered from severe low back pain since 10 days ago after some exercise. She has back pain with radiating to bilateral subcostal areas. The pain aggravated by bending forward. X ray of spine showed T12 vertebral body compression fracture. MRI demonstrated compression fracture at T12 with bone marrow edema and increased bone marrow enhancement. Bone mineral density checked by Dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry revealed osteopenia. The symptoms were not relieved by conservative treatments and she received vertebroplasty for pain relief. The operation course was smooth, but she started to suffer from orthostatic headache after the procedure. Spinal MRI revealed fluid accumulation at posterior epidural space of T11-12-L1 and CSF leakage was impressed. Intracranial hypotension related to CSF leakage was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic criteria formulated by Schievink, et al (2008). After hydration and bed-rest, her symptoms improved gradually without epidural blood patch. CONCLUSION: Our report highlights the possibility and importance of intracranial hypotension related to CSF leakage after vertebroplasty. Clinicians should be alert to this complication.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Thirty patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were treated with posterior pedicle screw fixation combined reduction of central end-plate by end-plate expand clamp and vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement. There were 22 males and 8 females with an average of 47 years (range from 25 to 71 years). Segment of fracture had 1 case in T11, 5 in T12, 14 in L1, 8 in L2, 2 in L3, 1 in L4, 1 in L5. According to Denis typing, 4 cases were type A, 25 type B, 1 type C, 1 type D, 1 type E. The relative anterior height of vertebral body and the vertebral angle were measured before and after operation and during the follow-up period (8 months after operation) through X-ray, the failure of internal fixation and recurrent kyphosis were evaluated during the follow-up period. Vertebral intracorporeal gap was measured by CT images after operation and the central end-plate fracture and reduction were observed by the reconstructed CT images (sagittal and coronary) before and after operation. RESULTS: All patients were followed up from 8 to 15 months with an average of 12 months. Relative anterior height of vertebral body and vertebral angle were well restored after operation, and there was no significant change between after operation and 8 months after operation. Preoperative,postoperative and 8 months after operation, relative anterior height of vertebral body respectively was 40.1%, 98.2%, 97.8%, vertebral angle respectively was 18.30, 2.70, 3.20. No failure of internal fixation and recurrent kyphosis were found during the follow-up period. The vertebral intracorporeal gap was about 3.1% and reduction of central endplate fracture was satisfactory. CONCLUSION: Posterior short-segment pedicle screw fixation combined with vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement can provide excellent reduction of post-traumatic segmental kyphosis and restore vertebral body height in the fracture level, prevent the failure of internal fixation which is an ideal method for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures.",chi,0.0

Finkelstein,2006.0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients with intractable pain from osteoporotic or metastatic fractures: A prospective study using quality-of-life assessment,", ","PURPOSE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a minimally invasive outpatient procedure whereby vertebral compression fractures are stabilized by the injection of bone cement, or polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Rapid partial or complete pain relief can usually be achieved through this procedure. We prospectively evaluate the efficacy of PVP in the relief of pain and improvement in quality of life of patients with intractable pain from osteoporotic and metastatic fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with intractable pain from vertebral metastases (many resistant to palliative radiation therapy) and patients with intractable painful osteoporotic fractures were treated with parapedicular or transpedicular injection of PMMA. Plane X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were performed on all patients. With a reflex hammer, percussion pain was correlated to the imaging abnormalities. The preplanning CT scan was used to calculate the exact entry point and angle of the bone-biopsy needle. All patients were assessed before and after the procedure for quality of life and amount of pain. The following measures were used: 1) the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), for global pain, nausea, tiredness, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, sense of well-being, and shortness of breath; 2) a site-specific pain score (SSPS); 3) the amount of analgesic intake in morphine equivalents in the last 24 hours; and 4) the Townsend Functional Assessment Scale (TFAS), ascertaining mobility. A postprocedural CT scan was performed the same day on all patients. Follow-up assessment consisted of a phone call at Days 1, 2, and 4 and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Patients with recurrent back pain or complications were followed in the bone metastases clinic. RESULTS: Thirty patients (19 women, 11 men) were evaluated. Their median age was 68 years (range 31 to 87 years). Thirty procedures (n = 30) at 45 vertebral levels were performed; 13 were for pathologic fractures, and 17 were for osteoporotic fractures. SSPS showed a decrease of 2 or more levels in 88.5% of patients at 12-week follow-up. The mean SSPS with movement was 8.7 preprocedure and 1.8 postprocedure (P < 0.0001). Also, there was significant improvement in all 9 ESAS domains (P < 0.0004). The ingestion of analgesics in morphine equivalents showed a trend toward reduction post-PVP (P < 0.0599). When the patients with pathologic fractures were separated out, the reduction in ingestion of analgesics was significant (P < 0.0008). The TFAS demonstrated significant improvement in patient mobility and function. Extravertebral extravasation of cement was noted in 55.6% of the levels. We used a general linear mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance to analyze the data. CONCLUSIONS: PVP in osteoporotic and metastatic fractures significantly improved many patients' global quality-of-life scores and function by markedly decreasing their back pain and reducing their intake of pain medications. The procedure is safe, with no serious complications noted in our study.",eng,0.0

Leong,2005.0,Vertebroplasty by use of a strontium-containing bioactive bone cement,", ","STUDY DESIGN: A review of the laboratory and clinical data for a new strontium-containing hydroxyapatite bioactive bone cement. OBJECTIVES: To compare the properties of the strontium-containing bioactive bone cement with those of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) bone cements. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty using conventional PMMA bone cements have been effectively used to treat osteoporotic spine fractures with good short- and medium-term results. However, PMMA has some undesirable properties, including its high setting temperature, lack of osseointegration, and large stiffness mismatch with osteoporotic bone. These properties are responsible for some postoperative complications. METHODS: Strontium-containing hydroxyapatite (Sr-HA) bioactive bone cement consists of a filler blend of strontium-containing hydroxyapatite, fumed silica and benzoyl peroxide; and a resin blend of bisphenol A diglycidylether methacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate, and N, N-dimethyl-p-toluidine. Its properties, including mechanical strength, setting temperature, biocompatibility, and osseoinduction, were compared with other cements in vitro and in vivo. Early clinical results are presented. RESULTS: The Sr-HA cement has a setting time of 15 to 18 minutes, a maximum setting temperature of 58 degrees C, a compressive strength of 40.9 MPa, bending strength of 31.3 MPa, and a bending modulus of 1,408 MPa. The bending strength and modulus are closer to human cancellous bone. Sr-HA cement promotes osteoblast attachment and mineralization in vitro and bone growth and osseointegration in vivo. In a pilot study, 23 cases of osteoporotic fractures treated with this cement with a mean follow-up of 18 months suggest that it is as effective as PMMA in relieving pain. DISCUSSIONS: Oral strontium has been shown to induce new bone formation and is effective in reducing fracture risk in osteoporosis. Our data suggest that strontium delivered locally has the same effect; thus, the combination of strontium with HA in a cement with a low setting temperature, adequate stiffness, and low viscosity makes this a good bioactive cement for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.",eng,0.0

Often, these patients are not candidates for open surgical procedures and cannot address mechanical instability and radiation therapy can take weeks to become effective. Minimally invasive surgical techniques have been developed over the past several years, offering a simple and effective way of managing painful pathologic fractures.
RECENT FINDINGS: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty offer patients a minimally invasive, percutaneous procedure that dramatically reduces pain related to pathologic spinal fractures almost immediately with very low complication rates. Visual analog scale pain scores, narcotic usage and quality of life scales (SF-36) have all been shown to improve in a durable fashion for over 1 year. Also, these procedures can be performed before, after or concurrently with most radiation and chemotherapy protocols.
SUMMARY: We recommend vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in properly selected patients with painful pathologic fractures as early as possible. Newer biomaterials, which are softer than currently used cement, may offer better protection from adjacent level fracturing and lower complication rates. [References: 35]",English,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To find the biomechanical consequences of prophylactic vertebroplasty post fatigue loading. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty man be an effective treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. One frequently observed complication post surgery is the adjacent vertebral failure (AVF). The prophylactic vertebroplasty was proposed to prevent the AVF. The vertebroplasty is, nevertheless, an invasive intervention. More scientific proves are needed for the application of this surgery on a still intact vertebra. METHODS: Fourteen 5-level fresh human cadaveric thoracic motion segments were divided into standard and prophylactic group. Both ends of the specimen were mounted, leaving the center 3 vertebrae free. The lower level of free vertebrae was artificially injured and cement augmented. The center level vertebra of standard group remained intact and nonaugmented. The center level vertebra of prophylactic group also remained intact, but augmented with bone cement. The specimen was applied with a 2-hour, 5-Hz, 630-N (mean) compressive fatigue loading. Impulse test and CT scanning were conducted both before and after fatigue loading to find the variance of strain compliance of cortical shell and height of vertebral body. RESULTS: The strain compliance of cortical shell is generally not statistically significantly affected by the fatigue loading, cement augmentation and vertebral level (All P > 0.05). The only exception is that the cortical strain compliance of augmented vertebrae tentatively decreased post fatigue loading (P = 0.012 for tensile strain compliance, and P = 0.049 for compressive strain compliance). The height loss of intact vertebra adjacent to a 2-level augmented (or intact-augmented) vertebra is significantly lower than the one adjacent to a 1-level augmented (or injury-augmented) vertebra (P = 0.014). For an osteoporotic vertebra, neither cortical strain compliance nor vertebral height loss is connected with bone mineral density (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The strain compliance of cortical shell is generally not a sensitive indicator to predict risk of fatigue injury if the fatigue loading is mild. The prophylactic augmentation strengthens the osteoporotic vertebrae, decreases the progression of vertebral height loss, reduces the anterior body shift, and hence protects the adjacent intact vertebra from elevated flexion bending. It can be cautiously suggested that if the vertebra is osteoporotic and adjacent level is located at pivot or lordotic level of spinal column, the prophylactic augmentation may be an option to prevent the AVF.",eng,1.0

However, there have been some limitations in restoring the height of the collapsed vertebrae and in preventing the leaking of cement. In the severely collapsed vertebrae of more than two thirds of their original height, vertebroplasty is regarded as a contraindication. We tried postural reduction using a soft pillow under the compressed level. This study was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of the combination of postural reduction and vertebroplasty for re-expansion and stabilization of the osteoporotic vertebral fractures. METHODS: A total of 75 patients with single level vertebral compression fracture were treated with postural reduction followed by vertebroplasty. In 30 patients, the vertebral body was severely collapsed more than two-thirds of its original height. We calculated the compression ratio (anterior height/posterior height) and measured the Cobb angle. We analyzed the degree of re-expansion according to the onset duration. RESULTS: The mean compression ratio was 0.60 +/- 0.15 initially and increased to 0.75 +/- 0.17 after vertebroplasty. The mean Cobb angle was 16.14 +/- 11.29 degrees and corrected to 10.71 +/- 12.08 degrees. The degree of re-expansion showed significant relation with the onset duration. Twenty-eight of 30 (93%) severely collapsed vertebrae re-expanded after postural reduction, which made vertebroplasty possible. CONCLUSION: This new method of vertebroplasty leads to significant restoration of height and correction of kyphosis. The re-expansion was closely related with onset duration. In cases of severely collapsed vertebrae which is able to be re-expanded by postural reduction, vertebroplasty could be applied safely.",eng,0.0

This percutaneous image-guided interventional radiology procedure allows stabilization of a vertebral body by injection of an acrylic cement and frequently results in significant symptomatic relief. During cement polymerisation, an exothermic reaction may destroy adjacent tumor cells. Advances have been made to reduce complications from extravasation of cement in veins or surrounding soft tissues. Safety relates to experience but also to technical parameters: optimal cement radio-density, adequate digital fluoroscopy unit (single or bi-plane digital angiography unit), development of cements other than PMMA to avoid the risk of adjacent vertebral compression fractures. The rate of symptomatic relief from vertebroplasty performed for its principal indications (vertebral hemangioma, metastases, osteoporotic fractures) reaches 90-95%.

The construct for biological bone graft/vertebral augmentation is osteoconductive and osteoinductive, and is used to create biologic vertebral stabilization and reconstruction. The adjacent vertebra integrity is protected by the construct with similar elasticity and physical characteristics of the biologic morcelized bone, more matched to that of adjacent bone than PMMA.

Combined anterior and posterior approaches are the most common salvage procedure for symptomatic failed vertebroplasty. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a single posterior approach technique for the treatment of patients with symptomatic failed vertebroplasty. METHODS: Ten patients with symptomatic failed vertebroplasty underwent circumferential debridement and anterior reconstruction surgery through a single-stage posterior transpedicular approach (PTA) from January 2009 to December 2011 at our institution. The differences of visual analog scale (VAS), neurologic status, and vertebral body reconstruction before and after surgery were recorded. The clinical outcomes of patients were categorized as excellent, good, fair, or poor based on modified Brodsky's criteria. RESULTS: The symptomatic failed vertebroplasty occurred between the T11 and L3 vertebrae with one- or two-level involvement. The average VAS score was 8.3 (range, 7 to 9) before surgery, significantly decreased to 3.2 (range, 2 to 4) after surgery (p < 0.01), and continued to decrease to 2.4 (range, 2 to 3) 1 year later (p < 0.01). The average correction of Cobb's angle after surgery was 17.3 degrees (range, 4 degrees to 35 degrees ) (p < 0.01). The mean loss of Cobb's angle correction after 1 year of follow-up was 2.7 degrees (range, 0 degrees to 5 degrees ). The average allograft subsidence at 1 year after surgery was 1 mm (range, 0 to 2). The neurologic status of Frankel's scale significantly improved after surgery (p = 0.014) and at 1 year after surgery (p = 0.046). No one experienced severe complications such as deep wound infection or neurologic deterioration. All patients achieved good or excellent outcomes after surgery based on modified Brodsky's criteria (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Single-stage PTA surgery with circumferential debridement and anterior reconstruction technique provides good clinical outcomes and low complication rate, which can be considered as an alternative method to combined anterior and posterior approaches for patients with symptomatic failed vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

Chung,2012.0,Clinical evaluation of repeat percutaneous vertebroplasty for symptomatic cemented vertebrae,10.1097/BSD.0b013e31825ef90f,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) with polymethylmethacrylate is widely used to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture and satisfactory clinical outcomes have been reported in the literature. However, recurrent or persistent back pain after PV is not uncommon. Sometimes, the pain may result from pathogenesis within the previously treated vertebra. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of repeat PV for treating patients with recurrent back pain caused by the previously cemented vertebrae. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 18 patients who underwent repeat PV to treat symptomatic cemented vertebrae. Patients were categorized into 3 groups based on clinical presentation and imaging studies: those with refracture (RF), residual vacuum (RV), and osteonecrosis (ON) along the bone-cement interface. A bipedicle approach was used for repeat PV in all patients. The visual analogue scale (VAS) and modified Brodsky criteria were used to evaluate clinical outcomes before and after surgery. The Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Spearman correlation analyses were used to analyze patient surgical prognosis and radiologic findings. RESULTS: Nine patients were diagnosed with RF, 5 with RV, and 4 with ON. The average VAS score was 77.1 (range, 62-90) before repeat PV (80.1, 72.4, and 76.3 for the RF, RV, and ON groups, respectively) and 34.4 (range, 25-45) after repeat PV treatment (33.1, 36.8, and 34.3 for the RF, RV, and ON groups, respectively). The VAS score significantly decreased in all 3 groups. The vertebral body height was significantly restored by a mean of 13.9% across all groups (17.8%, 12.7%, and 6.8% in the RF, RV, and ON groups, respectively). Fifteen patients recovered from vertebral compression fracture and regained their preinjury activities of daily living. No surgery-related complications occurred except asymptomatic cement leakage in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this research demonstrate that repeat PV may be an effective method for relieving recurrent or persistent pain in patients with symptomatic cemented vertebrae, allowing them to regain functional activity.",eng,1.0

Prokop,2014.0,[Clinical cost analysis of balloon kyphoplasty--is there a possibility of cost-covering treatment?],10.1055/s-0034-1368472,"Financial pressure on hospitals has been a major issue in the health care system of the past years and the financial situation is often what decides about the future of the hospitals. Therefore today the economic feasibility of patient treatment in hospitals is more important than ever before. After the degradation of the case-based lump sum of I09D to I09F on a one and two level kyphoplasty we took that as motivation to do a cost analysis on 10 randomised cases. The average age of the patients was 75 years (m : f = 2 : 8), the average stay in hospital was 8 days (3-12 d). The analysis was done by a searching of documents in cooperation with the firm GFG-Beratungsgesellschaft mbH (Monchengladbach, Germany). We found that the average overall cost which includes the cost of hospital stay and the expenditure on material was 7512.53 euro and the average earnings of the cases was 7610,97 euro, the difference and in that way the proceeds was 98.44 euro. On that result performance of a one-level kyphoplasty especially after the degradation of the case-based lump sum in 2013 is possible in a cost-covering way, an increase in profit may be possible by a decrement of hospital stay. In 2014 one- and two-stage kyphoplasty once underwent a reduction of G-DRG from I09F to I09E. At the same time the cost weight of lump compensation I09E was increased by 0.071 with the result that in 2014, with an increased federal base value of 3156.82 euro (in 2013 the federal base rate value was 3068.37 euro), additional proceeds of 404,92 euro can be realised in the field of one- and two-stage kyphoplasty compared to in 2013. On that result a one-level kyphoplasty especially after the degradation of the case-based lump sum in 2013 and in 2014 is possible in a cost-covering manner, an increase in profit may be possible by a decrement of hospital stay.",ger,0.0

Kim,2015.0,Effect of Augmentation Material Stiffness on Adjacent Vertebrae after Osteoporotic Vertebroplasty Using Finite Element Analysis with Different Loading Methods,", ","BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty is an effective treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fractures, which are one of the most common fractures associated with osteoporosis. However, clinical observation has shown that the risk of adjacent vertebral body fractures may increase after vertebroplasty. The mechanism underlying adjacent vertebral body fracture after vertebroplasty is not clear; excessive stiffness resulting from polymethyl methacrylate has been suspected as an important mechanism. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to compare the effects of bone cement stiffness on adjacent vertebrae after osteoporotic vertebroplasty under load-controlled versus displacement-controlled conditions. STUDY DESIGN: An experimental computer study using a finite element analysis. SETTING: Medical research institute, university hospital, Korean. METHODS: A three-dimensional digital anatomic model of L1/2 bone structure was reconstructed from human computed tomographic images. The reconstructed three-dimensional geometry was processed for finite element analysis such as meshing elements and applying material properties. Two boundary conditions, load-controlled and displacement-controlled methods, were applied to each of 5 deformation modes: compression, flexion, extension, lateral bending, and torsion. RESULTS: The adjacent L1 vertebra, irrespective of augmentation, revealed nearly similar maximum von Mises stresses under the load-controlled condition. However, for the displacement-controlled condition, the maximum von Mises stresses in the cortical bone and inferior endplate of the adjacent L1 vertebra increased significantly after cement augmentation. This increase was more significant than that with stiffer bone cement under all modes, except the torsion mode. LIMITATIONS: The finite element model was simplified, excluding muscular forces and incorporating a large volume of bone cement, to more clearly demonstrate effects of bone cement stiffness on adjacent vertebrae after vertebroplasty. CONCLUSION: Excessive stiffness of augmented bone cement increases the risk of adjacent vertebral fractures after vertebroplasty in an osteoporotic finite element model. This result was most prominently observed using the displacement-controlled method.",eng,0.0

Lee,2015.0,Patterns of Treatment for Metastatic Pathological Fractures of the Spine: The Efficacy of Each Treatment Modality,10.4055/cios.2015.7.4.476,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic pathological fractures of the spine are a major problem for cancer patients; however, there is no consensus on treatment strategy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate various treatment options by analyzing their patterns for metastatic pathological fractures of the spine. METHODS: In this study, 54 patients (male:female = 36:18) who were diagnosed with metastatic pathological fractures of spine were recruited. Demographic data, origin of cancer, type of treatment, and results were obtained from electronic medical records. Treatment options were divided into radiotherapy (RT), vertebroplasty (VP) or kyphoplasty (KP), operation (OP), and other treatments. Treatment results were defined as aggravation, no response, fair response, good response, and unknown. The survival time after detection of pathologic fractures was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 62.3 years. Hepatocellular carcinoma was the most common cancer of primary origin (n = 9), followed by multiple myeloma (n = 8). RT was the most common primary choice of treatment (n = 29, 53.7%), followed by OP (n = 13, 24.1%), and VP or KP (n = 10, 18.5%). Only 13 of 29 RT cases and 7 of 13 OP cases demonstrated a fair or good response. The mean survival time following detection of pathological spinal fractures was 11.1 months for 29 patients, who died during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: RT was the most common primary choice of treatment for metastatic pathological fractures of the spine. However, the response rate was suboptimal. Although OP should be considered for the relief of mechanical back pain or neurologic symptoms, care should be taken in determining the surgical indication. VP or KP could be considered for short-term control of localized pain, although the number of cases was too small to confirm the conclusion. It is difficult to determine the superiority of the treatment modalities, hence, a common guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of metastatic pathological fractures of the spine is required.",eng,1.0

Lee,2013.0,Usefulness of prone cross-table lateral radiographs in vertebral compression fractures,10.4055/cios.2013.5.3.195,"BACKGROUND: Dynamic radiographs are recommended to investigate non-healing evidence such as the dynamic mobility or intravertebral clefts in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). However, it is difficult to examine standing flexion and extension lateral radiographs due to severe pain. The use of prone cross-table lateral radiographs (PrLRs) as a diagnostic tool has never been proposed to our knowledge. The purpose of this study is to clarify the usefulness of PrLRs in diagnosis and treatment of VCFs. METHODS: We reviewed 62 VCF patients examined with PrLRs between January 1, 2008 and June 30, 2011. To compare the degree of pain provoked between standing extension lateral radiographs (StLRs) and PrLRs, numeric rating scale (NRS) scores were assessed and compared by a paired t-test. Vertebroplasty was done for 40 patients and kyphoplasty was done for 9 patients with routine manners. To assess the degree of postural reduction, vertebral wedge angles (VWA) and vertebral height ratios (VHR) were calculated by using preoperative StLRs, PrLRs, and postoperative lateral radiographs. Two variables derived from changes in VWA and VHR between preoperative and postoperative radiographs were compared by a paired t-test. RESULTS: The average NRS scores were 6.23 +/- 1.67 in StLRs and 5.18 +/- 1.47 in PrLRs. The degree of pain provocation was lower in using PrLRs than StLRs (p < 0.001). The average changes of VWA between preoperative and postoperative status were 5.24 degrees +/- 6.16 degrees with PrLRs and 3.46 degrees +/- 3.47 degrees with StLRs. The average changes of VHR were 0.248 +/- 0.178 with PrLRs and 0.148 +/- 0.161 with StLRs. The comparisons by two variables showed significant differences for both parameters (p = 0.021 and p < 0.001, respectively). The postoperative radiological status was reflected more precisely when using PrLRs than StLRs. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with StLR, the PrLR was more accurate in predicting the degree of restoration of postoperative vertebral heights and wedge angles, and provoked less pain during examination. The PrLR could be a useful diagnostic tool to detect intravertebral cleft or intravertebral dynamic instability.",eng,0.0

The goal of this study was to investigate whether the presence of severe pain immediately after vertebroplasty predicts short- and long-term pain relief. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A chart review was performed to categorize patients regarding pain severity and analgesic usage immediately after vertebroplasty (< 4 h). Severe"" pain was defined as at least 8 of 10 with the 10-point VAS. Outcomes were pain severity and pain medication score and usage at 1 month and 1 year after vertebroplasty. Outcomes and clinical characteristics were compared between groups by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Of the 429 vertebroplasty procedures identified, 69 (16%) were associated with severe pain, and 133 (31%) were associated with analgesic administration immediately after the procedure. The group experiencing severe pain had higher preprocedure median VAS rest pain scores (5 [IQR, 2-7]) and activity pain scores (10 [IQR, 8-10]) compared with patients who did not experience severe pain (3 [IQR, 1-6]; P = .0208, and 8 [IQR, 7-10]; P = .0263, respectively). At 1 month postprocedure, VAS rest and activity pain scores were similar between the severe pain group and the nonsevere pain group (P = .16 and P = .25, respectively) and between the group receiving pain medication and the group not receiving pain medication (P = .25 and P = .67, respectively). This similarity continued for 1 year after the procedure. Analgesic usage was similar among all groups at 1 year postprocedure.

Because of complications such as extravasation of bone cement (polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA) and adjacent vertebral fractures, some practitioners prefer to inject a small volume of PMMA. In that case, however, insufficient augmentation or a subsequent refracture of the treated vertebrae can occur. A 65-year-old woman visited our clinic complaining of unrelieved severe low back and bilateral flank pain even after she had undergone VP on the 1(st) and 4(th) (L1 and L4) lumbar vertebrae a month earlier. Radiologic findings showed the refracture of L1. We successfully performed the repeat VP by filling the vertebra with a sufficient volume of PMMA, and no complications occurred. The patient's pain and immobility resolved completely three days after the procedure and she remained symptom-free a month later. In conclusion, VP with small volume cement impaction may fail to relieve fracture-induced symptoms, and the refracture of an augmented vertebral body may occur. In this case, repeat VP can effectively resolve both the persistent symptoms and problems of new onset resulting from refracture of the augmented vertebral body due to insufficient volume of bone cement.",eng,1.0

However, many literatures reported both asymptomatic and serious complications. The aim of the present study was to summarize, collect data and report the complication ofvertebroplastyfrom our experience at a single institute. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Three hundred and twenty five vertebroplasty procedures from 236 patients performed in our institute were retrospectively reviewed. Data of diagnosis, age at the time of procedure were collected. All complications found were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: Commonly performed procedures were at thoracolumbar junction (51.4%). Osteoporosis was the most common cause of fracture. The present study found 88 (27%) complications with 26 (8%) symptomatic patients. Most common complication was cement leakage, which intervertebral disc was the most common site (42.9). Spinal canal leakage was found in 14 cases (20%). Four out of 14 cases had neurological complications and need further managements. Two cases had neurologic complications from needle injury.Adjacent level collapse found in 13 patients (4%) and remote segment collapse occurred in 5 patients (1.5%). Three had progressive kyphosis required later surgical treatment. One asymptomatic cement pulmonary embolism was found in the present study.

However, the value of simple transpedicular biopsy in VCFs is less addressed. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the value of transpedicular biopsy during PVP for uncovering the malignancy in VCFs in a 10-year retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the study period of the 1019 patients who underwent PVP for VCFs, 450 patients comprising of 127 male and 323 female underwent transpedicular biopsy during PVP for 705 fractured vertebras. The medical records were analyzed for age, gender, imaging studies, operation notes, pre-operative and post-operative diagnoses, date of vertebroplasty and biopsy, vertebral level and pathological reports. RESULTS: Pathology of the specimens of the 450 patients confirmed non-malignant VCFs in 389 (86.44%) and malignancy in 61 (13.56%). The malignant pathology included: 52 (11.56%) distant metastases to vertebra, in 3 (0.67%) of the spinal metastases was unsuspected and in 49 (10.89%) of them the malignancy was suspected pre-operatively. There were 9 (2%) primary spinal malignancies, 2 (0.44%) unsuspected multiple myeloma and 7 (1.56%) pre-operatively suspected primary malignancies. The frequency of unsuspected malignancy was 1.11% (5/450) in this study. There was no complication associated with transpedicular biopsy during PVP.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the relevant incidence and risk factors of delayed vertebral collapse and progressive kyphosis with spinal canal encroachment after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for vertebral compression fracture (VCF). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Delayed vertebral collapse and progressive kyphosis with spinal canal encroachment are complications after PVP for VCF. METHODS: Between December 2002 and February 2011, 843 patients underwent PVP for VCFs for at least 2 years of minimum follow-up term in a tertiary referral center. All imaging measurements were obtained digitally, with comparisons of the Cobb angle and spinal canal stenosis on fractured vertebral level at 3 different time points of pre- and postvertebroplasty, and before revision surgery. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (14 fractures) who underwent PVP had delayed vertebral collapse and progressive kyphosis on the level of the fractured vertebra, 3 were male and 10 female, with a median age of 75 years (range, 66-89 yr). One had 2-level VCFs. All were treated with revision surgery of decompressive laminectomy for spinal canal stenosis with neurological complications. Twelve patients had additional instrument fixation. The involved vertebras were concentrated at the thoracolumbar junction region (T11-L2). The mean Cobb angles were measured at 23.67 degrees before PVP, 15.90 degrees after PVP, and 30.92 degrees before revision surgery. The ratio of spinal canal stenosis was 35.45% and 49.48% before PVP and revision surgery, respectively. The occurrence rate of delayed complications was about 1.5% (13/843). CONCLUSION: Conservative treatment and minimal invasive vertebral augmentation surgery can be selected from patients with stable VCFs. Close follow-up is warrant to monitor the occurrence of late collapse with neurological complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.",eng,1.0

Percutaneous vertebroplasty is frequently used for treating patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. However, the leakage of bone cement during PV may lead to serious complications, such as spinal cord compression or pulmonary embolism. Herein we present a secure procedure designed to safely and effectively deliver the bone cement into the vertebral column. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with a total of 50 levels of osteoporotic compression fracture were consecutively recruited for the study. During a routine PV operation, acrylic cement was injected with a simultaneous application of a continuous negative pressure to the contralateral side of the vertebral body. This negative pressure exerts a pulling force that attracts the bone cement to flow within the vertebral body. RESULTS: With the proposed decompressed PV procedure, cross-filling of the vertebrographies was achieved for all 50 fracture levels, with no paravertebral venous plexus leakage. Three of the 50 levels (6%) exhibited contrast-medium leakage into the intradisc or cortical defect regions. After decompressed cement injection, excellent cross-filling of bone cement deposition was achieved in 38 of the 50 levels (76%; cement cross-filling region >75%), good cross-filling deposition was achieved in 7 levels (14%; cement cross-filling region >50%), deposition was poor in 3 levels (6%; cement cross-filling region <50%), and deposition failed in 2 levels (4%; fixed cement with no sign of cross-filling). Routine postoperative reviews revealed that six fracture levels (12%) had minimal cement leakage, with two leaking into the disc and four into paravertebral cortical defect regions.

Fifty-two patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures occurring at the thoracolumbar junction were enrolled in this study. All patients were classified into two groups; group I was treated with a unilateral approach and group II with a bilateral approach. The Cobb angle was measured each time to evaluate the kyphotic angle during the pre- and post-operative periods and at last follow-up, and a 10-point visual analog scale for pain was recorded at the same time. We found that the bilateral approach had a greater advantage in the reduction of kyphosis and the loss of reduction was less than the unilateral approach for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.",eng,0.0

Patients presented with severe radiating leg pain rather than lower back pain from recent osteoporotic compression fracture of lower lumbar vertebra. Radiologic findings showed osteoporotic compression fracture combined with preexisting stenosis of the intervertebral foramen resulting in root compression. After injection of polymethylmethacrylate into the compressed vertebral body through the pedicle of the symptomatic side, all seven patients experienced dramatic pain relief that lasted throughout the mean follow-up duration of 9.1 months.

Increased risk of new adjacent vertebral fracture (NF) has been reported to be a complication of cement leakage in vertebroplasty. In our observation, an incidental intervertebral cement leakage may occur during vertebroplasty but is commonly asymptomatic. The study focused on osteoporotic collapse patients who had percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) between 2005 and 2007. We divided patients into leakage and non-leakage groups and compared the incidence of NF. Leakage characteristics were divided into three types: Type I intervertebral-extradiscal leakage, Type II intradiscal leakage and Type III combined leakage. Visual analog scale for pain and the Karnofsky Performance Status at 24 h, three months, six months and one year were compared between groups and types of leakages. Among 148 PVs (102 patients) there were 30 leakages (20.27%) and 21(14.19%) NFs. The incidence of NF did not significantly differ between leakage and non-leakage groups (P<0.05). Type II was the most common type of leakage (15/30). Reduction of average pain and improvement of Karnofsky Performance Status score did not differ between groups (P< 0.05). Type II had decreased pain score < type I and III at 24 h (P < 0.01), three months and six months (P < 0.1) but not at one year (P<0.10). Type II also had decreased pain score < non-leakage group only at 24 h (P<0.05). Intervertebral cement leakage is not an increased risk for NF, influenced outcomes of pain relief or improvement of physical function. Intradiscal leakage (Type II) is the most common characteristic of cement leakage and probably related to delayed pain relief.",eng,1.0

Our aim was to assess technical and clinical complications of vertebral augmentation procedures performed for pain palliation and/or stabilization of neoplastic lytic vertebral body lesions, with cortical erosion of the posterior wall, often associated with a soft-tissue epidural mass. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 48 patients, we performed retrospective vertebral augmentation assessment on 70 consecutive levels with cortical erosion of the posterior wall, as demonstrated by preprocedural CT/MR imaging. An epidural mass was present in 31/70 (44.3%) levels. Cavity creation was performed with Coblation Wands before cement injection in 59/70 levels. Injection of high-viscosity polymethylmethacrylate was performed under real-time continuous fluoroscopic control. Postprocedural CT of the treated levels was performed in all cases. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 and 4 weeks postprocedurally. RESULTS: In 65/70 (92.8%) levels, the vertebral augmentation resulted in satisfactory polymethylmethacrylate filling of the lytic cavity and adjacent trabecular spaces in the anterior half of the vertebral body. An epidural leak of polymethylmethacrylate occurred in 10/70 (14.2%) levels, causing radicular pain in 3 patients, which spontaneously resolved within 1 week in 2 patients, while 1 patient with a T1-T2 foraminal leak developed severe weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles and a permanent motor deficit. CONCLUSIONS: In our series of vertebral augmentation of neoplastic lytic vertebral lesions performed for palliation of pain and/or stabilization, we observed a polymethylmethacrylate epidural leak in only 14.2% of levels, despite the presence of cortical erosion of the posterior wall and an epidural mass, with an extremely low rate of clinical complications. Our data seem to justify use of vertebral augmentation in patients with intractable pain or those at risk for vertebral collapse.",eng,1.0

Gonski,2015.0,Vertebroplasty for acute painful osteoporotic fractures (VAPOUR): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,10.1186/s13063-015-0671-8,"BACKGROUND: With increasing human longevity there is increasing prevalence of osteoporosis and of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Most vertebral fractures do not require medical therapy for pain, but a minority are associated with severe pain and disability. Vertebroplasty has been used increasingly for painful acute osteoporotic fractures. The best available evidence for vertebroplasty is provided by two placebo controlled trials which showed no significant clinical benefit of vertebroplasty over placebo. These were not acute fracture trials with the majority of fractures in both trials being well beyond the acute time frame of 6 weeks. There is evidence from an open label randomized controlled trial of vertebroplasty versus conservative therapy in acute fractures suggesting clinical efficacy in acute vertebral fractures. METHODS: This is a blinded trial of Vertebroplasty for Acute Painful Osteoporotic fractURes - the VAPOUR trial. Patients greater than 60 years in age with new severe onset of back pain and osteoporotic vertebral fractures of less than 6 weeks duration will be enrolled. They will be randomized to receive either vertebroplasty or a placebo procedure. Data regarding pain, disability, and quality of life will be collected over a 6-month period. The enrolled patients and the outcome assessors will remain blinded for the duration of the trial. DISCUSSION: The VAPOUR trial will apply similar methodology to the previous blinded trials but in a patient group with exclusively acute fractures and the most severe pain.

The effectiveness of vertebroplasty, using an adequate vertebral fill technique, in fractures of less than 6 weeks' duration has not been specifically assessed by previously published masked trials. METHODS: This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vertebroplasty in four hospitals in Sydney, Australia. We recruited patients with one or two osteoporotic vertebral fractures of less than 6 weeks' duration and Numeric Rated Scale (NRS) back pain greater than or equal to 7 out of 10. We used an automated telephone randomisation service provided by the National Health and Medical Research Council to assign patients (1:1; stratified according to age, degree of vertebral compression, trauma, corticosteroid use, and hospital) to either vertebroplasty or placebo, immediately before the procedure. Patients received conscious sedation. Vertebroplasty was done with the adequate vertebral fill technique and the placebo procedure with simulated vertebroplasty. Follow-up was for 6 months. Outcome assessors and patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with NRS pain below 4 out of 10 at 14 days post-intervention in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01482793. FINDINGS: Between Nov 4, 2011, and Dec 5, 2014, 120 patients were enrolled. 61 patients were randomly assigned to vertebroplasty and 59 to placebo. 24 (44%) patients in the vertebroplasty group and 12 (21%) in the control group had an NRS pain score below 4 out of 10 at 14 days (between-group difference 23 percentage points, 95% CI 6-39; p=0.011). Three patients in each group died from causes judged unrelated to the procedure. There were two serious adverse events in each group, related to the procedure (vertebroplasty group) and the fracture (control group). INTERPRETATION: Vertebroplasty is superior to placebo intervention for pain reduction in patients with acute osteoporotic spinal fractures of less than 6 weeks' in duration. These findings will allow patients with acute painful fractures to have an additional means of pain management that is known to be effective.

Is kyphoplasty better than conservative treatment?,", ","OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disease worldwide. Consequences of vertebral osteoporotic fractures include pain and progressive vertebral collapse resulting in spinal kyphosis, decreased quality of life, disability and mortality. Minimally invasive procedures represent an advance to the treatment of osteoporotic VCFs. Despite encouraging results reported by many authors, surgical intervention in an osteoporotic spine is fraught with difficulties. Advanced patients age and comorbidities are of great concern. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We designed a retrospective case-control study on 110 post-menopausal women consecutively visited at our institution. Study population was split in a surgical and a conservative cohort, according to the provided treatment. RESULTS: Kyphoplasty treated patients had lower back pain VAS scores at 1 month as compared with conservatively treated patients (p < 0.05). EQ5D validated questionnaire also showed a better quality of life at 1 month for surgically treated patients (p < 0.05). SF-12 scores showed greater improvements at 1 month and 3 months with statistically significant difference between the two groups just at 3 months (p < 0.05). At 12 months, scores from all scales were not statistically different between the two cohorts, although surgically treated patients showed better trends than conservatively treated patients in pain and quality of life. Kyphoplasty was able to restore more than 54.55% of the original segmental kyphosis, whereas patients in conservative cohort lost 6.67% of the original segmental kyphosis on average. CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty is a modern minimal invasive surgery, allowing faster recovery than bracing treatment. It can avoid the deformity in kyphosis due to VCF. In fact, the risk to develop a new vertebral fracture after the first one is very high.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were enrolled at 11 sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia by using an institutional review board-approved protocol and HIPAA compliance, and all patients provided written informed consent. Patients were randomized to undergo vertebroplasty or a control procedure. After 1 month, patients were allowed to cross over and undergo the alternate procedure. Coprimary outcomes were patient-reported function, measured with the modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), and pain (on a scale of one to 10) at 1 year. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and as-treated (AT) analyses were used to compare outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one participants (68 in the vertebroplasty group and 63 in the control group) were included in the analyses. Patients in both groups showed improvements in pain and function at 1 year. In ITT analyses, patients randomized to vertebroplasty did not differ from control subjects in terms of RDQ results (difference, 1.37 points; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.88, 3.62; P = .231) but reported lower levels of pain (difference, 1.02 points; 95% CI: 0.04, 2.01; P = .042).

METHODS: Sixteen patients were included in this open prospective study. Inclusion criteria were: one or 2 vertebral fractures responsible for severe pain, i.e., higher than 50 mm on a visual analog scale (VAS: 0-100 mm), scores 3, 4 or 5 according to the McGill-Melzack scoring system, and evolving for more than 3 months. Assessment criteria were the changes over time (Days 3, 30, 90, 180) in VAS and McGill-Melzack scoring system. The changes over time in a generic health status instrument score [the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP)] were also assessed. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon T test. RESULTS: There were 9 women and 7 men: postmenopausal osteoporosis (n = 7), corticosteroid induced osteoporosis (n = 2), and male osteoporosis (n = 7). Vertebroplasty was performed in 20 vertebrae.

A significant decrease over time for 5/6 dimensions of the NHP score was also noted: pain (p < 0.01), physical mobility (p < 0.05), emotional reactions (p < 0.05), social isolation (p < 0.05), and energy (p < 0.05). We observed no adverse event, and no vertebral fracture has occurred after 6 months of followup. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a useful and safe procedure for treating persistent painful osteoporotic fractures. Controlled studies with longterm followup are required.",eng,0.0

Ozer,2009.0,The major complications of transpedicular vertebroplasty,10.3171/2009.4.spine08466,"OBJECT: Vertebroplasty is a well-known technique used to treat pain associated with vertebral compression fractures. Despite a success rate of up to 90% in different series, the procedure is often associated with major complications such as cord and root compression, epidural and subdural hematomas (SDHs), and pulmonary emboli, as well as other minor complications. In this study, the authors discuss the major complications of transpedicular vertebroplasty and their clinical implications during the postoperative course. METHODS: Vertebroplasty was performed in 12 vertebrae of 7 patients. Five patients had osteoporotic compression fractures, 1 had tumoral compression fractures, and 1 had a traumatic fracture. Two patients had foraminal leakage, 1 had epidural leakage, 1 had subdural cement leakage, 2 had a spinal SDH, and the last had a split fracture after the procedure. RESULTS: Three patients had paraparesis (2 had SDHs and 1 had epidural cement leakage), 3 had root symptoms, and 1 had lower back pain. Two of the 3 patients with paraparesis recovered after evacuation of the SDH and subdural cement; however, 1 patient with paraparesis did not recover after epidural cement leakage, despite cement evacuation. Two patients with foraminal leakage and 1 with subdural cement leakage had root symptoms and recovered after evacuation and conservative treatment. The patient with the split fracture had no neurological symptoms and recovered with conservative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Transpedicular vertebroplasty may have major complications, such as a spinal SDH and/or cement leakage into the epidural and subdural spaces, even when performed by experienced spinal surgeons. Early diagnosis with CT and intervention may prevent worsening of these complications.",eng,1.0

Journal Article,J. V. Coumans; M. K. Reinhardt; I. H. Lieberman,2003.0,Kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fractures: 1-year clinical outcomes from a prospective study,", ","OBJECT: Over the past 15 years, vertebroplasty has emerged as a treatment for vertebral compression fractures. This technique, however, does not restore vertebral height and is associated with a high rate of cement leakage. Recently, kyphoplasty was developed in an effort to circumvent this problem. Although its immediate results have been reported, it is unclear whether the benefits endure. METHODS: Seventy-eight consecutive patients underwent 188 kyphoplasty procedures. The patients responded to Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaires, a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain rating, and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) instrument; additionally they underwent detailed neurological and radiographic examinations pre- and postoperatively. The preoperative SF-36, VAS, and ODI scores, the neurological examination results, and the radiographic data were compared with the postoperative findings. Thirteen patients died of disease progression or unrelated illness. Of the surviving patients, complete data were available in 62% (minimum follow-up period 12 months, mean 18 months). Complications included one myocardial infarction and five cases of asymptomatic cement extravasation. No case of neurological deterioration occurred during the follow-up period. Significant improvements in seven measures of the SF-36 inventory as well as on the ODI and VAS were noted early postoperatively, and these persisted throughout the follow-up period, despite a statistically insignificant decline in the measure of general health at last follow-up examination. CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty is an effective treatment for vertebral compression fractures. The benefits presented in the early postoperative period and persisted at 1 year posttreatment.",eng,0.0

We report 2 cases of acute CPDD after intravenous zoledronic acid therapy. Case #1: a 63-year-old female was admitted for vertebroplasty at the site of an osteoporotic fracture. She received an intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid 5mg on the day after the procedure. Acute CPDD developed in her right knee 24hours later. Findings from joint aspiration and standard radiography confirmed the diagnosis. Case #2: this 79-year-old woman had a history of CPDD was on glucocorticoid and hydroxychloroquine therapy for lupus. She was given an intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid 5mg as prophylaxis of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Joint pain and a fever developed later on the same day. After 5 days, she had arthritis of the right wrist, laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation, and hypocalcemia. Radiographs showed evidence of CPDD. A Medline search identified 6 cases of bisphosphonate-related CPDD, including 2 due to pamidronate, 2 to etidronate, 1 to alendronic acid, and 1 to neridronic acid. The features were similar to those in our patients, with a short time to onset, systemic inflammation in many cases, a tendency toward hypocalcemia, and radiographs that often showed evidence of CPDD. Bisphosphonate-induced CPDD is a rare eventuality that should nevertheless be borne in mind by rheumatologists. Also, in patients with CPDD while taking bisphosphonate therapy, a role for the drug in the symptoms should be considered.",eng,0.0

The most common serious complications related to BKP include cement extravasation and new fractures at adjacent levels. Although the potential for tumor extravasation"" has been discussed as a potential iatrogenic complication, it has yet to be confirmed. The authors report on 2 cases of tumor extravasation following BKP, which they base on an observed unusual rapid tumor spread pattern into the adjacent tissues. They postulate that by increasing the vertebral body internal pressure and disrupting the tissues during balloon inflation and cement application, a soft-tissue tumor can be forced beyond the vertebral bony boundaries through pathological cortical defects. This phenomenon can manifest radiologically as subligamentous spread and/or extension into venous sinusoids, resulting in epidural venous plexus involvement, with subsequent tumor migration into the adjacent vertebral segments. Accordingly, the authors advise caution in using BKP when significant epidural tumor is present. The complication they encountered has caused them to modify their preference such that they now first use radiosurgery and subsequently BKP to ensure the target is appropriately treated, and they are currently developing possible modifications of procedural technique to reduce the risk.""",eng,1.0

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 93 patients with 154 vertebrae of osteoporotic vertebra compressed fracture, who received PKP from January 2012 to December 2013 in Beijing Tian Tan Hospital, Capital Medical University. All procedures were bilateral and non-high-pressure polymethyl methacrylate injection. The balloon volume (BV), balloon peak pressure (Pmax), CV and the ratio of Pmax to BV (P/BV) were documented. The data was analyzed by correlation analysis and linear regression analysis to reveal the correlation between BV and CV. RESULTS: Seven vertebrae had bone cement leakage, no intraspinal leakage, no neuro-deficit. Visual analogue scale was 0-2 of all patients on 3 d postoperation. The data of 147 vertebrae without leakage: BV was 2.1-6.3 ml, Pmax was 130-359 psi, CV was 2.8-8.5 ml, and the ratio of Pmax to BV (P/BV) was 25-263 psi/ml. The data analysis showed there was no high correlation between BV and CV as one group (R<0.75). However if divided the data into three groups by the value of P/BV, group A (P/BV<100), group B (100</=P/BV<200), group C (P/BV>/=200), there was high correlation and linear relationship between BV and CV in each group (R>0.75, P<0.01). CV was 0.9-1.1 times of BV in group A; CV was 1.4-1.6 times of BV in group B; and CV was 2.0-2.2 times of BV in group C. CONCLUSION: CV is predictable by the BV and the ratio of Pmax to BV. It can reduce the rate of the leakage, and also can prevent the unsatisfactory results by insufficient bone cement volume.",chi,0.0

Peri-operative complications are rare; however, they can potentially be devastating. To the best of our knowledge, complications during balloon kyphoplasty have not been described previously in published case reports. CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old man who was a farmer of Caucasian origin presented with a 6-month history of back pain after a fall. We discovered a significant T12 wedge compression fracture, so we performed a T12 balloon kyphoplasty. Approximately 2 weeks after being discharged from our hospital, the patient presented with increasing back pain. He presented for a second time with excruciating pain on the left side of his thoracolumbar region, so he was admitted to our ward. X-rays did not show any further fractures or compromise, but magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive edema in the T11 and L1 vertebral bodies as well as fluid tracking from the T11-T12 disc into the vertebral body. Nine days after being discharged, the patient presented to the outpatient clinic with severe back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging at that visit showed edema at the levels above and below the T11/T12 disc. He was put into a brace and given 300mg of morphine, which did not provide any pain resolution. Posterior instrumentation from T9 to L2 (pedicle fixation of T9-T10 as well as L1-L2, rods in between and a crosslink above T11-T12) was performed as the final treatment, and the patient was discharged uneventfully. CONCLUSION: Patients presenting with residual pain over a previous balloon kyphoplasty level should raise high suspicion for a fracture or complication involving the levels above and/or below the balloon kyphoplasty. The best way to treat fractures that develop after a failed balloon kyphoplasty is to instrument and fuse posteriorly. Our present case report shows that a high level of suspicion for possible new fractures should be maintained for all similar cases.",eng,0.0

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three cases of vertebral collapse were evaluated with CT and MR imaging to determine osteoporotic origin and recent evolution. Percutaneous vertebroplasties were performed using CT guidance. The 20 patients included in the study (17 women, 3 men; 62-92 years old) had acute pain of less than 1 month's duration that hindered ambulation and required treatment with narcotic drugs. They underwent this procedure for analgesic purposes. The analogic visual scale of Huskisson was used for pain when scoring assessment. RESULTS: In 15 patients (75%), pain relief was complete within 24 hr after injection. Analgesic administration was stopped in 14 patients. Mild pain persisted in three (15%) of the remaining five patients. In one other patient (5%), crural pain was observed with cement leakage in the psoas muscle. In the fifth patient (5%), pain recurred after the patient was lifted. The pain was related to a new acute collapse of an adjacent vertebrae. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral collapse is a minimally invasive procedure that provides immediate pain relief and enables the patient to become quickly mobile.",eng,1.0

RESULTS: Twelve patients (54%) treated with vertebroplasty showed new fractures at 3 months compared to 10 (37%) in the control group. This was not statistically different (p=0.049). In the vertebroplasty group, the new fractures involved vertebrae adjacent to the treated vertebra in 77% of cases (p=0.009) compared to only 15% in the control group.

A 3-D, two-functional unit, CT-based, lumbar spine, FE model was developed and used to predict load transfer and likelihood of fracture following balloon kyphoplasty. The fractured anterior wall and injected cement were modelled in a two-functional spinal unit model with osteoporotic bone properties. Parameters investigated included: cement stiffness, cement volume and height restoration. Models were assessed based on stresses and a user-defined fracture-predicting field. Augmentation altered the stress distribution; shielding was dependent on positioning of the cement; and fracture algorithm found incomplete height restoration to increase the likelihood of fracture, particularly in adjacent vertebrae.",eng,0.0

The aims of treatment are: minimally invasive and maximally effective tumour removal, fracture position, stabilization, pain reduction, and improved quality of life. The specific features and problems of diagnosis and treatment using the cavity/coblation method, , the surgical technique, and the results of the treatment of 250 patients with spinal tumours/metastases are presented.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumour resection is carried out by plasma field, via percutaneous trans-/extrapedicular access, followed by kyphoplasty. Clinical and radiological follow-up was carried out postoperatively, including data on pain reduction and improvement of quality of life.
RESULTS: Within 6 years (March 2008t February 2014) a total of 250 patients, or 812 spines were treated. In 59 cases dorsal percutaneous instrumentation and straightening were carried out. Minimal blood loss and a very low complication rate were recorded. After surgery, significant pain reduction, satisfaction, early mobilization, and improvement in quality of life were demonstrated in all patients. Immediate radio- and chemotherapy could be carried out. In 38 cases cement escaped laterally into the intervertebral space, but this had no clinical relevance. 188 patients have since died because of tumour manifestations.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the referral rate for long-term osteoporosis management following vertebral compression fracture treated by different specialties at a single academic institution. METHODS: Patients undergoing vertebral cement augmentation for painful osteoporotic compression fractures from 2009 to 2014 were identified. Medical records were reviewed to determine if the treating surgeon discussed and/or referred the patient for long-term osteoporosis management. Any referral for or mention of medical long-term osteoporosis management was counted as a positive response. Results were statistically analyzed with chi-square test. RESULTS: Two hundred fourteen patients underwent vertebral cement augmentation; 150 met inclusion criteria. Orthopedic surgeons treated 88 patients, neurosurgeons treated 39, and interventional radiology or pain management physicians treated 23. Orthopedic surgeons referred 82% of patients for osteoporosis management, neurosurgeons referred 36%, and interventional radiology/pain management referred 17%. The referral rate was significantly higher for orthopedic surgeons compared with either of the other two groups; there was no significant difference between neurosurgery and interventional radiology/pain management. CONCLUSIONS: Among physicians who treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, orthopedic surgeons more frequently address osteoporosis or refer patients for osteoporosis management compared with neurosurgeons and interventional radiologists or pain management physicians. The results of this study shed light on the disparity in how different specialties approach treatment of osteoporosis in patients with fractures painful enough to require surgery and highlight potential areas for improvement in osteoporosis awareness training.",eng,0.0

This technique has been commonly used to treat osteoporotic, vertebral body compression fractures. The technique was also used to augment painful metastatic vertebral fractures. The objective of this study was to review the clinical and radiological results after kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral body compression fractures due to spinal metastasis and multiple myeloma and to determine factors that may affect outcome. Thirty-one patients had 41 vertebral body fractures secondary to spinal metastasis or multiple myeloma. A kyphoplasty procedure was performed on 39 levels. The pain and neurological status were evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the American Spinal Injury Association classification scale scores, respectively. Radiological evaluations were used to measure vertebral body height loss (VBHL) and the segmental kyphosis angle before and after surgery. The major symptoms that patients presented with included pain (25 patients); and neurological deficit (four patients). Two patients presented with no symptoms because the metastases were found during cancer screening. The mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) VAS score was 7.2+/-2.2 before surgery and 1.6+/-1.3 after surgery. The mean preoperative VBHL was 27.8+/-11.3% for the thoracic spine and 27.7+/-12.5% for the lumbar spine. VBHL values were reduced to 22.4+/-10.0% and 18.4+/-10.4% for the thoracic and lumbar spine after surgery, respectively. The segmental kyphosis angles decreased from 21.2+/-11.4 degrees to 17.0+/-9.8 degrees for the thoracic spine and from 15.3+/-8.8 degrees to 10.4+/-7.2 degrees for the lumbar spine after surgery. There was a correlation between the symptom duration and VBH restoration rate. There was no correlation between the amount of injected polymethylmethacrylate and pain relief. We concluded that kyphoplasty is a safe and effective procedure for treating painful vertebral body fractures caused by metastasis and multiple myeloma. It can restore VBH and correct the kyphosis angle. While the increased amount of the injected PMMA led to its leakage, it did not contribute to restoration of the VBH or kyphosis correction. Therefore, one should avoid injection of excessive amounts of PMMA.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,R. A. DalCanto; M. K. Reinhardt; I. H. Lieberman,2009.0,Double cement-application cavity containment kyphoplasty: technique description and efficacy,", ","Kyphoplasty is an effective surgical treatment for the pain and deformity that can accompany vertebral compression fractures. In certain cases, however, defects or clefts in the vertebral body result either from the original fracture or from expansion of inflatable bone tamps (IBTs). Through such a defect, cement may extrude into the epidural space, paraspinal soft tissues, or disc space. In addition, by virtue of the dynamic nature of certain fracture configurations, the height restored by inflation of the bone tamps may be lost once the tamps are removed for cement placement, despite patient positioning. In our modification of the kyphoplasty technique, we use 2 cement applications to minimize potential extravertebral cement extravasation and maintain the height restoration achieved with the IBTs. After 0.75 to 1.5 cm(3) of cement is deposited, the IBTs are reinserted into the fracture and inflated until the cement cures. Once the cement is cured, the IBTs are again deflated and removed, leaving a cement shell that seals the cracks and supports the endplates. Then, another batch of cement is mixed and is used to fill the cavities, as in the standard technique. Results for our first 21 patients show a mean correction of more than 6 degrees of kyphosis and no cement leaks into the spinal canal.

METHODS: This ex vivo biomechanical pilot study utilized 16 osteoporotic cadaveric vertebral bodies in a standardized fracture model to compare unipedicular RF-TVA (n = 8) to bipedicular BK (n = 8). Four specimens from each group were tested in loaded and unloaded conditions. All specimens were imaged, assessed for height restoration, and sectioned to observe PMMA distribution. A subset of specimens underwent computed tomography scanning to assess cavity creation and trabecular architecture prior to cement delivery. RESULTS: Anterior height restoration was greater with RF-TVA (median: 84%, interquartile range: 62%-95%) compared to BK (median: 69%, interquartile range: 60%-81%), although the difference did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0.16). Anterior height restoration was numerically greater under loaded (median: 70% versus 66%) and unloaded (median: 94% versus 77%) conditions with RF-TVA versus BK. RF-TVA produced more discrete cavities and less native trabecular destruction compared to marked trabecular destruction observed with BK. RF-TVA consistently showed a well-identified focal area of PMMA with an extensive peripheral zone of PMMA interdigitation, providing mechanical interlock into the adjacent intact trabecular matrix. In contrast, BK yielded little evidence of PMMA interdigitation beyond the boundaries created by the balloon tamp due to the crushed trabecular bone peripherally.

Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia involvement of the cervical spine is rare. Review of literature indicates only few reported cases of surgical management with one case of mortality indicating increased risks associated with surgical intervention. While PVP is commonly used for the treatment of osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures, its role in vertebral stabilization for fibrous dysplasia has not been reported.

The lesion had pathologic fractures, and there was an os odontoideum with cervical cord atrophy at the C1 level. After discussing need for aggressive surgical management and potential complications, we offered PVP due to surgical risks involved. PVP was performed with a posterolateral transpedicular approach without complication.

The procedure, although minimally invasive, could be painful and is better tolerated if a conscious sedation regimen is added to local anesthesia. An anesthesiologist usually performs the sedo/analgesia, but frequently, he is not available in our angiography unit, so we have begun to perform the sedo/analgesia ourselves following an analogous situation that physicians of the Digestive Endoscopic Unit of our institution experienced some years ago. METHODS: Using the guidelines developed by Italian Society of Digestive Endoscopy, Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reanimation and Intensive Therapy and National Association of Endoscopy Operators and Technicians as a starting point, we then adapted their protocol to our vertebroplasty requirements, after an adequate training period carried out by our anesthesiologist staff. RESULTS: The results have been very satisfactory, greatly appreciated by patients for good pain control; we have never registered any adverse effects nor have we had any particular problems in controlling sedation or monitoring procedures. CONCLUSION: In our experience, we have observed that conscious sedation can be safely administered by neuroradiologists during spinal procedures, provided that some basic rules are respected regarding patient selection and monitoring, personnel training and angiography equipment.",eng,0.0

We report our experience about the treatment of a specific subgroup of traumatic vertebral fractures (AOSpine type A) with BKP through a retrospective analysis. METHODS: Sixty-one patients affected by AOSpine type A traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine underwent BKP at our institution (2004-2008): 26 males and 35 females; mean age 52 +/- 15 (18-75) years. At 6-12 and 60 months follow-up examinations, vertebral height restoration, sagittal spinal alignment and pain were recorded. RESULTS: Kyphoplasty proved to be a safe method to treat these fractures preserving a relative correct spinal sagittal balance with recovery of the morphology of the fractured vertebra, vertebral height and the angle of kyphosis. CONCLUSIONS: BKP used for traumatic fractures significantly alleviates pain, does not cause notable complications and enables patients to return to their normal lives in a short time.",eng,0.0

Ninety-four patients with single level vertebral fractures were enrolled. Fractures were divided into two types according to the shape of the fractured vertebrae: wedge type (n = 54) or biconcave type (n = 40). All fractures were further classified into 3 grades (grade 1-3) according to their severity. The Visual Analog Score for back pain improved significantly in the wedge"" and in the ""biconcave"" group: there was no significant difference between groups. Wedge type fractures had a significantly greater correction of anterior vertebral height and kyphotic angle than biconcave type fractures (p < 0.01). Biconcave type fractures had a significantly greater correction of the middle vertebral height (p < 0.01), but had a higher risk of intradiscal cement leakage (p = 0.03). Rates of cement leakage in grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 fractures were 12.8%, 25.8%, and 50.0%, respectively : there was a gradually higher risk of cement leakage as the severity of compression increased (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: assessing the shape and severity of fractured osteoporotic vertebrae gives an idea of the potential correction of body height and kyphosis, and of the risk of cement leakage.""",eng,0.0

They strengthen the bone and improve the intense pain caused by fracture secondary to osteoporosis, metastasis, or trauma and refractory to conservative therapies such as analgesic use, bed rest, and bracing. Aim of the study is to investigate and compare safety and efficacy of KP and PV on pain and mobility in patients with vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis or trauma. METHODS: Twenty-one patients have been enrolled in a prospective nonrandomized controlled study with painful vertebral compression fractures resistant to common therapies. Patients underwent KP or PV. A Visual Analog Scale has been used to measure pain status at different time up to 6 months; the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was chosen to evaluate functional activity before procedure and 6 months later. RESULTS: Mean pain scores decreased significantly from pretreatment to posttreatment with KP and PV as did the ODI scores. No significant differences could be found between both groups for the mean VAS and ODI scores preprocedure and postprocedure. Cement extravasation occurred only during PV. No other adverse events correlated to both techniques have been reported.

Gerszten,2016.0,A Longitudinal Cohort Investigation of the Development of Symptomatic Adjacent Level Compression Fractures Following Balloon-assisted Kyphoplasty in a Series of 726 Patients,", ","BACKGROUND: Balloon-assisted kyphoplasty (BAK) is a well-accepted treatment for symptomatic vertebral compression fractures (VCF) secondary to osteoporosis. Some have raised a concern of an increased incidence of adjacent fractures due to alterations in spine biomechanics after cement augmentation. The incidence of subsequent VCFs following BAK is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the timing, location, and incidence of new VCFs following BAK and to identify risk factors associated specifically with the occurrence of new adjacent level fractures. OBJECTIVES: The study was performed to determine the incidence of symptomatic subsequent adjacent and remote level compression fractures in a cohort of patients undergoing BAK. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort investigation at an academic medical center and a central referral center for VCFs. SETTING: A consecutive single surgeon series of 726 patients with osteoporotic compression fractures. METHODS: A prospectively collected cohort of 726 patients who underwent BAK between 2001 and 2014 for osteoporotic VCFs was evaluated. Seventy-seven patients were identified who underwent a second BAK for a new compression fracture and were include in the present series. The indication for BAK treatment was pain unresponsive to non-surgical management for all cases. Variables were recorded for each patient, including the time between index and subsequent fracture, fracture level, and number of initial fractures as well as with tobacco use, body mass index (BMI), and chronic steroid use. RESULTS: Seventy-seven of 726 patients (10.6%) underwent a second BAK procedure on average 350 days following the initial procedure (range 21 to 2,691 days). Third and fourth procedures were less common, treated in 11 and 3 patients, respectively. Forty-eight of 77 patients (62%) suffered a fracture at a level immediately adjacent to the index level at mean time of 256 days. Remote level fractures were treated at a mean time of 489 days, but no statistical difference was noted. There was no statistically significant difference between tobacco use, BMI, and chronic steroid use between patients suffering from remote and adjacent level VCFs. LIMITATIONS: This was not a population based study, and the true incidence of subsequent fractures after BAK might be underestimated by this analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic compression fractures after BAK are relatively uncommon and may occur long after the initial kyphoplasty procedure. Only half of subsequent fractures occur immediately adjacent to the initially treated level; the others occur remotely. Patients with a single symptomatic thoracic or lumbar fracture suffered from remote and adjacent level fractures equally. In contrast, all patients who suffered both a thoracic and lumbar fracture at the same time had a second fracture at an adjacent level. Specific risk factors for remote versus adjacent level fractures could not be determined.

OBJECTIVE: Assess efficacy, safety, and new fracture occurrence after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) in a large uncontrolled cohort of ultra elderly VCF patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: VCFs are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Percutaneous injection of polymethylmethacryl-ate into the fractured vertebral body, vertebroplasty, has been extensively performed as an effective minimally-invasive treatment option for VCF patients. The patient sample included consecutive, osteoporotic patients with symptomatic VCFs electing to enter the study. METHODS: Baseline visual analogue scale rating, analgesic usage, duration of symptoms. Subsequent VAS ratings, analgesic utilization, and new fractures were assessed within 30 minutes after the procedure, at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postprocedure. OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual Analogue Scale score, analgesic utilization, patient satisfaction, cement extravasation, and new fractures. RESULTS.: A total of 123 (74% female) underwent PV for 163 VCFs. Eleven patients did not complete final follow-up at 2 years due to death unrelated to the PV procedure. The mean VAS score was 7.6 at baseline and 3.1 at 30 minutes after the procedure, and 2.3, 1.2, 1.1, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.5 at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. Improvement over time was statistically significant using repeated measures analysis of variance (P < 0.05). No complications were encountered during the follow-up intervals. Thirteen new fractures were observed (10.6%) at a mean 20.8 weeks (1-52 weeks) after PV with 6 new fractures (4.9%) involving an adjacent level in 5 patients (4.1%).

One-third of these patients require treatment for acute or chronic pain. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty were introduced over the last two decades as treatments for incapacitating pain from osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Both techniques proved effective and safe in numerous retrospective and prospective studies. They now deserve to be incorporated into the standard treatment strategy for painful and incapacitating vertebral fractures. Kyphoplasty seeks not only to stabilize the vertebra, but also to correct the kyphosis induced by the vertebral body collapse. However, the correction is often limited (less than 15 degrees ) and has not been shown to increase the benefits in terms of pain relief or quality-of-life improvement, compared to vertebroplasty. Kyphoplasty is more costly than vertebroplasty, which is therefore emerging as the treatment of choice. However, a randomized double-blind trial comparing vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty is needed. Furthermore, a randomized comparison of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty versus noninterventional treatment is needed in patients admitted for pain immediately after a vertebral crush fracture.",eng,0.0

Pain scores (on a 0 to 25 scale) and levels of function (on a 0 to 20 scale) were recorded on presentation, at 24 hours, at 6 weeks, and 6 to 12 months after therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (70%) were treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty and 24 (30%) were treated by conservative therapy alone. They were followed for a mean of 215 days (range, 57 to 399 days). The baseline clinical characteristics, bone densitometry, and fracture data were similar in the two groups. Twenty-four hours after vertebroplasty, there was a 53% reduction in pain scores (from 19 to 9; P = 0.0001) and a 29% improvement in physical functioning (from 14 to 18; P = 0.0001), whereas pain scores and physical functioning remained unchanged at 24 hours in the patients treated conservatively (both P = 0.0001 compared with the changes after percutaneous vertebroplasty).

AIM: To characterise the histological process of fracture healing in acute osteoporotic vertebral body fractures using qualitative and quantitative bone histomorphometry. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Transpedicular bone biopsy was performed in patients undergoing percutaneous vertebroplasty. Undecalcified biopsy specimens were prepared from cores of cancellous bone harvested from vertebral bodies with MRI evidence of bone marrow oedema. These were analysed by light microscopy using grid analysis and defined using bone histomorphometry criteria. Normative data obtained from 5 age-matched volunteers without evidence of metabolic bone disease or osteoporosis was used for comparison. RESULTS: Adequate biopsy specimens were obtained in 72 of 90 patients (15 men and 57 women), mean age 75.6 years. All biopsies confirmed severe osteoporosis with reduced cancellous bone volume (mean of 13.5%; P<0.001 compared to controls). The timing of biopsies varied from 1 to 24 weeks (median of 6 weeks) after the fracture event. There were 4 stages of fracture callus healing observed: Stage I in 17 (24%) patients, Stage II in 16 (22%), Stage III in 22 (30%) and Stage IV in 17 (24%). An overlap between the various stages was evident with 55 (76%) patients demonstrating at least 2 or more of the stages of fracture healing in the same biopsy specimen. The time interval since fracture event was the most important predictor of the stage of the fracture callus (R=0.32; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrates a mixed fracture callus with overlapping of the various stages of fracture healing.

A potential contributory factor to such fractures may be the excessive mismatch of mechanical properties between contemporary bone cements (i.e. polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and bisphenol-a-glycidyl dimethacrylate (BIS-GMA)) and bone. Aluminum-free glass polyalkenoate cements (GPCs) present an interesting alternative to conventional bone cements. GPCs adhere to the philosophy that implant materials should have mechanical characteristics similar to those of the bone, and also offer chemical adhesion and intrinsic bioactivity. However, their influence on the loading patterns of augmented vertebrae (as compared with conventional bone cements) is not available in the literature. The present work investigates how the moduli of PMMA, BIS-GMA and GPC implants affect the stress distribution within a single, augmented vertebra, in both healthy and osteoporotic states. Using a finite element model of the L4 vertebra derived from computed tomography data, with simulated augmentation, it was found that, as cement stiffness increased, stress was redistributed from the cortical and trabecular bone to the cement implant. The GPC implant exhibited the least effect on stress redistribution in both the healthy and osteoporotic models compared to its acrylic counterparts. The significance of this work is that, under simulated physiological loading conditions, aluminum-free GPCs exhibit stress distribution throughout the vertebral body similar to that of the healthy bone. In comparison to conventional augmentation materials, the use of aluminum-free GPCs in VP and KP may help to ameliorate the clinical complication of adjacent vertebral body compression fractures.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of VP in alleviating pain, improving quality of life (QoL) and restoring alignment. METHODS: In a prospective monocenter case series from May 2007 until July 2008, there were 1,408 vertebroplasties performed during 319 interventions in 306 patients with traumatic, lytic and osteoporotic fractures. The 249 interventions in 233 patients performed because of osteoporotic vertebral fractures were analyzed regarding demographics, treatment and radiographic details, pain alleviation (VAS), QoL improvement (NASS and EQ-5D), complications and predictors for new fractures requiring a reoperation. RESULTS: The osteoporotic patient sample consisted of 76.7% (179) females with a median age of 80 years. A total of 54 males had a median age of 77 years. On average, there were 1.8 VBs fractured and 5 VBs treated. The preoperative pain was assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS) and decreased from 54.9 to 40.4 pts after 2 months and 31.2 pts after 6 months. Accordingly, the QoL on the EQ-5D measure (-0.6 to 1) improved from 0.35 pts before surgery to 0.56 pts after 2 and to 0.68 pts after 6 months. The preoperative Beck Index (anterior height/posterior height) improved from a mean of 0.64 preoperative to 0.76 postoperative, remained stable at 2 months and slightly deteriorated to 0.72 at 6 months postoperatively. There were cement leakages in 26% of the fractured VBs and in 1.4% of the prophylactically cemented VBs; there were symptoms in 4.3%, and most of them were temporary hypotension and one pulmonary cement embolism that remained asymptomatic. The univariate regression model revealed a tendency for a reduced risk for new or refractures on radiographs (OR = 2.61, 95% CI 0.92-7.38, p = 0.12) and reoperations (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 0.94-8.949, p = 0.1) when prophylactic augmentation was performed. The final multivariate regression model revealed male patients to have an about three times higher refracture risk (radiographic) (OR = 2.78, p = 0.02) at 6 months after surgery. Patients with a lumbar index fracture had an about three to five times higher refracture/reoperation risk than patients with a thoracic (OR = 0.33/0.35, p = 0.009/0.01) or thoracolumbar (OR = 0.32/0.22, p = 0.099/0.01) index fracture. CONCLUSION: If routinely used, VP is a safe and efficacious treatment option for osteoporotic vertebral fractures with regard to pain relief and improvement of the QoL. Even segmental realignment can be partially achieved with proper patient positioning. Certain patient or fracture characteristics increase the risk for early radiographic refractures or new fractures, or a reoperation; a consequent prophylactic augmentation showed protective tendencies, but the study was underpowered for a final conclusion.",eng,1.0

Zhang,2016.0,Risk factors for predicting cement leakage following percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures,10.1007/s00586-015-3923-0,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study is to identify independent risk factors for the occurrence of cement leakage (CL) during percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for four different leakage types in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 292 patients who underwent PVP for single-level OVCF from January 2009 to March 2011. The influences of several potential risk factors that might affect the occurrence of CL were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Cement leakage was evaluated by computed tomography and classified into four different types: through the basivertebral vein (B-type), the segmental vein (S-type), a cortical defect (C-type), and intradiscal leakage (D-type). RESULTS: Cement leakage was found in 227 of the 292 treated vertebrae. None of the parameters showed a statistically significant effect by univariate analysis. However, multivariate analysis showed that cement viscosity was an independent risk factor in B-type CL, fracture severity and fracture type were in S-type CL, fracture severity and presence of cleft on MRI were in C-type CL, and fracture severity, cortical disruption on MRI, presence of cleft on MRI and cement viscosity were in D-type CL. CONCLUSION: Each different vertebral fracture pattern has its own risk factors for CL. Identification of the above predicting factors for CL preoperatively might be helpful for more rigorous and strict patient selection criteria for the appropriate candidates for PVP.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To assess differences in kyphosis after balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) or vertebral body stenting (VBS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cement augmentation techniques allow early mobilization in patients with osteoporotic thoracolumbar fractures. Biomechanically, the grade of reduction and preservation are as important as in nonosteoporotic fractures. With BKP, negative effects of balloon deflation on the reduction and whether specific combinations of materials may preserve the reduction are as yet unclear. METHODS: Twelve bisegmental human thoracolumbar specimens (6xT12-L2, 6xL3-L5; age at death, 76.3 yr; range, 63-89 yr; female:male ratio, 3:3; bone mineral density, 68.1 g/cm; mean, 12.9 g/cm) were tested in a spine simulator with pure moments of 7.5 Nm to assess primary and secondary stability. After flexibility testing of the intact specimens, an eccentric compression force induced standardized fractures, which were reduced using either BKP or VBS against a flexional moment of 2.5 Nm. Primary and secondary stability were assessed using range of motion in a spine tester. The specimens were tested after each of 3 periods of cyclic flexion loading. The kyphotic angle of the index vertebra was measured radiographically. RESULTS: The 2 techniques achieved comparable reduction against a relatively high bending moment in this model. Neither technique restored the stability of the intact state; with increasing loads, the range of motion continuously increased to the level of fractured specimen to the level of the fractured specimen. Although the deflation effect on the kyphotic angle was lower with VBS (P</=0.05), there were no significant differences between the techniques relative to angle restoration. CONCLUSION: Both augmentation techniques are able to restore vertebral body height after thoracolumbar fractures. The deflation effect on the kyphotic angle was less with VBS than with BKP. High flexion moments during implantation limit the effectiveness of reduction using cement augmentation methods. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.",eng,0.0

The authors performed a retrospective chart review of a series of 95 patients in whom 149 painful, nonneoplastic compression fractures were demonstrated and who were treated with percutaneous transpediculate polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) vertebroplasty. In six of these patients there was evidence of vertebral osteonecrosis, as evidenced by the presence of an intravertebral vacuum cleft on radiography or by intravertebral fluid on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Clinical and radiological findings on presentation were noted. Technical aspects of the vertebroplasty technique were compiled. Response to therapy, defined as qualitative change in pain severity and change in level of activity, was noted immediately following the procedure and at various periods on follow-up reviews. One man and five women, who ranged in age from 72 to 90 years (mean 81 years), were treated. Each patient had one compression fracture. The fractures were at T-11 (one patient), L-1 (two patients), L-3 (two patients), and L-4 (one patient). The pain pattern was described as severe and localized to the affected vertebra, and sometimes radiated along either flank. Pain duration ranged from 2 to 12 weeks, and the pain was refractory to conservative therapy that consisted of bedrest, analgesics, and external bracing. At the time of treatment, all patients were bedridden because of severe back pain. In all patients either plain radiographic or computerized tomography evidence of intravertebral vacuum cleft or MR imaging evidence of vertebral fluid collection consistent with avascular necrosis of the vertebral body was demonstrated. Four patients underwent bilateral transpediculate vertebroplasty, and two patients underwent unilateral transpediculate vertebroplasty. The fracture cavities were specifically targeted for PMMA injection. Additional fortification of the osteoporotic vertebral body trabeculae was also performed when feasible. Cavitygrams"" or intraosseous venograms with gentle contrast injection were obtained prior to application of cement mixture. In all patients subjective improvement in pain and increased mobility were demonstrated posttreatment. The follow-up period ranged from 4 to 24 hours after treatment. Two patients made additional office visits at 1 and 3 months, respectively. Patients presenting with vertebral osteonecrosis (Kummell's spondylitis) often suffer from local paraspinous or referred pain. When performing vertebroplasty on these patients, confirmation of entry into the fracture cavities with contrast-enhanced ""cavitygrams"" should be performed prior to injection of PMMA cement. The response to vertebroplasty with regard to amelioration of pain and improved mobility is encouraging.""",eng,1.0

The purpose of our study was to evaluate prospectively the effects of vertebroplasty on mobility, analgesic use, pain, and SF-36 (short-form 36-item) scales for patients with painful vertebral compression fractures that are refractory to medical therapy. METHODS: We prospectively followed 167 patients who received 207 vertebroplasty treatment sessions for stabilization of 264 symptomatic vertebral compression fractures between August 1999 and January 2003. The average age of patients was 74.6 years (SD = 12.2 years), and 76% were women. Pre- and postprocedural measurements of pain, mobility, analgesic use, and SF-36 scales were compared at 1 month after the procedure and between 6 months and 3 years after the procedure with the SF-36 scales. RESULTS: Respective pre- and post-treatment pain scores were 8.71 (SE = 0.1) and 2.77 (SE = 0.18; P < .00001). Respective pre- and post-treatment analgesic use scores were 2.93 (SE = 0.9) and 1.64 (SE = 0.09; P < .00001). Respective pre- and post-treatment activity levels were 2.66 (SE = 0.1) and 1.64 (SE = 0.11; P < .00001).

Three pain patterns were formulized to classify pains due to OVCFs: midline paravertebral (Type A), diffuse paravertebral (Type B), and remote lumbosacral pains (Type C). The degree of compression was measured using scale of deformity index, kyphosis rate, and kyphosis angle. Numerical rating scores were serially measured to determine the postoperative outcomes. As vertebral body height (VBH) decreased, paravertebral pain became more enlarged and extended anteriorly (p<0.05). Type A and B patterns significantly showed the reverse relationship with deformity index (p<0.05), yet Type C pattern was not affected by deformity index. Postoperative pain severity was significantly improved (p<0.05), and patients with a limited pain distribution showed a more favorable outcome (p<0.05).

Improvements in both pain and mobility scores immediately post procedure were seen in all patients, and these results persisted at 3-month follow up. Percutaneous VP provided a successful, minimally invasive treatment of these patients' traumatic fractures while avoiding major surgical procedures and associated surgical morbidity and complications.",eng,1.0

All patients completed pre-operatively and post-operatively the VAS score (0-10, 10 being the worst state for pain) as well as the Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire at 3, 12, 24 and 36 months intervals. Overall the VAS score was reduced from 7.8 points pre-operatively, to 2.1 points at the 36 month follow up. Oswestry disability score improved from a pre-operative severe disability to moderate disability at 3 months up to a minimum disability at 36 months. The minimally invasive surgical techniques can significantly improve clinical outcomes by preventing many of the drawbacks associated with open approaches whilst also allowing to associate other methods such as coblation, vertebroplasty, interbody fusion that can be complementary to vertebral fixation.",eng,1.0

We report short-term outcomes in a consecutive cohort of patients treated with sacroplasty. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 57 patients treated with sacroplasty for painful osteoporotic sacral fractures at our institution between 2004 and 2011. An 11-point numerical rating scale pain score was recorded at rest and at activity pre- and post-procedure. Opioids prescribed to the patient both pre- and post-procedure were recorded. RESULTS: Mean duration of pain prior to sacroplasty was 3 weeks (IQR 2-5). Procedural complications were minimal. Median post-procedure follow-up time was 2.5 weeks (IQR 1-5) among 45 patients with available data. Thirty-seven (82%) of the 45 patients experienced a numerical or descriptive decrease from initial pain at follow-up. Median activity pain scores collected from 13 patients decreased from 10 (IQR 8.5-10) pre-procedure to 6 (IQR 4-6.8) post-procedure (p<0.0001), and median rest pain scores collected from 29 patients decreased from 7 (IQR 4-8.5) to 2 (IQR 1-3.5)(p<0.0001). Twenty-two (76%) of 29 patients had at least a 30% decrease in rest pain scores. The median number of opioids prescribed per patient decreased from 1 (IQR 1-2) pre-procedure to 0 (IQR 0-1) post-procedure (p<0.0001). Thirty-four of 57 patients (60%) had decreased opioid usage, 15 (26%) patients had unchanged usage and 8 (14%) had increased usage.

It has been observed that fractured vertebral bodies filled in with cement might also influence the increase of their height and thus lead to reduction of post-traumatic spine kyphosis. The aim of the research was to assess the possibility of reducing the kyphotic deformation of operated spine through kyphosis measurement of vertebras adjacent to fracture. 24 patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty on account of compression fracture of 40 vertebral bodies in thoracic and lumbar regions. On digital x-ray spine images taken in patients before and after surgery the angle of kyphosis or lordosis of bodies above and below the fractured vertebra was measured with the use of the Cobb method. Vertebroplasty in the material examined caused reduction of kyphosis in 33 cases (80.48%) and correction by 5.78 degrees on average. No regularity was found either between the occurrence of correction (and its level) and operated spine region or between the possibility of kyphosis correction and time that passed between fracture and surgery.,eng,0.0

Operative treatment of lumbar spine compression fractures includes fusion and/or cement augmentation. Our aim was to evaluate postoperative differences in patients treated surgically with fusion, vertebroplasty, or kyphoplasty. Methods. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database search for adult vertebral compression fracture patients treated 2004-2011 identified 102,316 surgical patients: 30.6% underwent spinal fusion, 17.1% underwent kyphoplasty, and 49.9% underwent vertebroplasty. Univariate analysis of patient and hospital characteristics, by treatment, was performed. Multivariable analysis was used to determine factors associated with mortality, nonroutine discharge, complications, and patient safety. Results. Average patient age: fusion (46.2), kyphoplasty (78.5), vertebroplasty (76.7) (p < .0001). Gender, race, household income, hospital-specific characteristics, and insurance differences were found (p </= .001). Leading comorbidities were hypertension, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Risks for higher mortality (OR 2.0: CI: 1.6-2.5), nonroutine discharge (OR 1.6, CI: 1.6-1.7), complications (OR 1.1, CI: 1.0-1.1), and safety related events (OR 1.1, CI: 1.0-1.1) rose consistently with increasing age, particularly among fusion patients. Preexisting comorbidities and longer in-hospital length of stay were associated with increased odds of nonroutine discharge, complications, and patient safety. Conclusions. Fusion patients had higher rates of poorer outcomes compared to vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty cohorts. Mortality, nonroutine discharge, complications, and adverse events increased consistently with older age.",eng,1.0

There is a paucity of data on the influence of kyphoplasty on spinal range of motion. To quantify early postoperative changes following kyphoplasty in spinal motion, a noninvasive, radiation-free measurement method was used and results related to clinical and radiological parameters. METHODS: The study group included 30 patients with an overall number of 54 symptomatic pathological vertebral compression fractures. All patients were treated with balloon kyphoplasty. Clinical results were recorded using the visual analog scale, SF 36, Roland Morris Score and the Oswestry Disability Index, at three time points; preoperative, 2 days postoperative, and at 12 weeks postoperative. The kyphosis angle/sagittal index were determined with biplanar X-rays. Amplitude/velocity of motion in extension/flexion was measured at each time point by use of the EpionicsSPINE((c)) system (Epionics Medical GmbH; Potsdam, Germany) using two external sensor strips. RESULTS: Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scans showed bone marrow edema in all vertebral bodies indicative of a recent, non-consolidated fracture. Pain and quality of life was significantly improved by kyphoplasty, both for the immediate postoperative period, as well as at 12 weeks postoperative. Radiological parameters also showed significant improvement following surgery. Total ROM did not significantly change 2 days after kyphoplasty, but amplitude and velocity were found to be increased 12 weeks postoperatively. Significant positive correlations were observed between increased range of motion and improved clinical/radiological scores. CONCLUSION: Significant clinical and radiological improvement following kyphoplasty supports the rational for cement augmentation in patients with pathological vertebral body fractures. To the knowledge of the authors, no prior study has assessed the influence of preservation and improvement of spinal range of motion on clinical outcome following kyphoplasty.",eng,0.0

The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to assess back pain and disability. Anterior, midline, posterior vertebral body heights, and kyphotic angle at the fractured vertebra were measured for radiographic evaluation. Clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations were performed postoperatively at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Complications and patient satisfaction with the surgical procedure were also recorded. The follow-up rate was 73.3% in the kyphoplasty group and 80.8% in the vertebroplasty group (P = 0.737). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to improvement in VAS and ODI scores (P > 0.05) at all postoperative intervals. Both treatment groups achieved marked vertebral height restoration and kyphotic angle reduction, but the radiographic parameters were signi fi cantly better in the kyphoplasty group (P < 0.05). The incidence of asymptomatic cement leakage per treated vertebrae in the kyphoplasty group was 11.4% versus 31% in the vertebroplasty group (P < 0.001). Three adjacent level fractures in the kyphoplasty group and 2 in the vertebroplasty group occurred during 2-year follow-up, and no difference in patient satisfaction was detected between the 2 groups. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty achieved similar improvement of clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction at 2 years after surgery, albeit kyphoplasty had more ability to markedly reduce vertebral deformity and resulted in less cement leaks compared with vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

Our purpose is to evaluate this technique and its effectiveness in restoring the height of such fractures. METHODS: Forty osteoporotic vertebral body fractures in 30 consecutive patients (24 female, six males; mean age, 70 years) were analyzed retrospectively, before and after percutaneous vertebroplasty, for changes in vertebral body height, kyphosis angle, and wedge angle. The ages of the fractures range from 1 to 5 months. RESULTS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty improved the pretreatment height of compression fractures in these patients by a mean of 47.6% (P < .001), with only 15% showing no improvement. These figures compare favorably with published results for kyphoplasty (47% mean improvement in height in 70% of fractures; no improvement in 30% of fractures). In addition, we achieved a mean improvement in kyphosis angle of 6 degrees and an improvement in the wedge angle of 3.5 degrees (as compared with published results for kyphoplasty of 7.4 and 4.3 degrees , respectively; P < .001).

Subsequent adaptations of the technique, development of materials and devices, and expansion of indications have led to many vertebral augmentation variants that have proven highly successful in treating pain related to osteoporotic compression fractures and vertebral body pathology, such as metastasis and myeloma. Vertebroplasty involves the image-guided percutaneous placement of a bone access needle into the affected vertebral body, followed by injection of the bone cement under intermittent imaging to assure appropriate placement of the cement. Supplemental techniques, such as the use of a balloon to create a cavity in the vertebral body, and attempt restoration of height have also been developed. The indications for the procedure, potential risks, and basics of the technique are reviewed here. With careful attention to technique, vertebral augmentation is a very safe and highly effective treatment for back pain related to vertebral body compression and bony pathology.

We evaluated the mortality risk for VCF patients undergoing conservative treatment (nonoperated), kyphoplasty, and vertebroplasty. Survival of VCF patients in the 100% U.S. Medicare data set (2005-2008) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences in mortality rates at up to 4 years were assessed by Cox regression (adjusted for comorbidities) between operated and nonoperated patients and between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty patients. An instrumental variables analysis was used to evaluate mortality-rate difference between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty patients. A total of 858,978 VCF patients were identified, including 119,253 kyphoplasty patients and 63,693 vertebroplasty patients.

Kyphoplasty patients had a 34% greater adjusted life expectancy than vertebroplasty patients. INTRODUCTION: Balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of painful VCFs. This comparative effectiveness study characterized the life expectancy of VCF patients as a function of their treatment. METHODS: Life expectancy of VCF patients in the 100% U.S. Medicare dataset (2005-2008) was estimated using a parametric Weibull survival model (adjusted for comorbidities), and compared between operated and non-operated patients as well as between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty patients. A total of 858,978 patients with a newly diagnosed VCF were identified, including 119,253 kyphoplasty patients (13.9%) and 63,693 vertebroplasty patients (7.4%). RESULTS: Adjusted life expectancy was 85% greater for operated than non-operated patients (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 82-89%). Compared to non-operated patients, the kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty patient cohort had 115% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 111-119%) and 44% (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 42-47%) greater adjusted life expectancy, respectively. Kyphoplasty patients had a 34% greater adjusted life expectancy than vertebroplasty patients (p < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 31-36%). Across all gender-age groups, the median life expectancy predicted by the parametric Weibull model was 2.2-7.3 years greater for operated than non-operated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant and substantial differences in life expectancy were observed between the treated and non-treated cohorts in the Medicare population. Among the treated cohorts, patients in the vertebroplasty group experienced less of a survival benefit than those who received kyphoplasty.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the mortality and morbidity risks for VCF patients undergoing conservative treatment (nonoperated), balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), and vertebroplasty (VP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Studies have reported lower mortality risk for BKP or VP cohorts than nonoperated cohorts, but it is uncertain whether there are any differences in morbidity risks. METHODS: Survival and morbidity was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences in outcomes were assessed by Cox regression between BKP, VP, and nonoperated cohorts. A propensity matching analysis was used to account for potential bias. RESULTS: A total of 1,038,956 VCF patients were identified, including 141,343 BKP patients and 75,364 VP patients. The nonoperated cohort was found to have a 55% higher adjusted risk of mortality (P < 0.001) than the BKP cohort and 25% higher adjusted risk of mortality (P < 0.001) than the VP cohort. The BKP cohort was also found to have a 19% lower adjusted risk of mortality (P < 0.001) than the VP cohort. The findings were similar for mortality with pneumonia diagnosed in the 90 days before death and also after propensity matching, as well as for subgroups of osteoporotic VCF patients, including those who survived at least 1 year and those with no cancer diagnosis. With propensity matching, the nonoperated cohort had significantly higher adjusted risks of pneumonia, myocardial infarction/cardiac complications, DVT, and urinary tract infection than the BKP cohort but lower adjusted risks of subsequent augmentation/fusion, subsequent augmentation, and pulmonary/respiratory complications. The BKP cohort also had significantly lower risks of morbidity than the VP cohort, except for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), infection, and myocardial infarction/cardiac complications, which were similar between both cohorts. CONCLUSION: VCF patients in the Medicare population who received vertebral augmentation therapies, specifically BKP and VP, experienced lower mortality and overall morbidity than VCF patients who received conservative management.

Median payer costs were identified for each treatment group for up to 3 years following VCF diagnosis, based on 67 018 VCF patients in the 5% Medicare dataset (2005-2008). A discount rate of 3% was used for the base case in the cost-effectiveness analysis, with 0% and 5% discount rates used in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: After accounting for the differences in median costs and using a discount rate of 3%, the cost per life-year gained for kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty patients ranged from $US1863 to $US6687 and from $US2452 to $US13 543, respectively, compared with non-operated patients. The cost per life-year gained for kyphoplasty compared with vertebroplasty ranged from -$US4878 (cost saving) to $US2763. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients for whom surgical treatment was indicated, kyphoplasty was found to be cost effective, and perhaps even cost saving, compared with vertebroplasty. Even for the oldest patients (85 years of age and older), both interventions would be considered cost effective in terms of cost per life-year gained.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: Treatment for vertebral compression fractures remains an area of controversy with respect to timing and type of surgical management. We analyzed the clinical outcomes and radiographic measurements of 4 different modalities of treatment for these fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: From 2001 to 2011, we analyzed a total of 363 patients after failure of 30 days of conservative management. These patients were then further managed either conservatively or with vertebroplasty, balloon kyphoplasty, or sky bone expander. Outcomes were assessed by using self-report measures: Visual Analog Score; functional measures: Oswestry Disability Index and Short-Form 36; and physiological measures: preoperative and postoperative radiographs. METHODS: The outcome measures were assessed for 6 months for those treated conservatively and up till 2 years for those treated surgically. Radiographic measurements of the spine were correlated with the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients (12.1%) were treated conservatively, 148 (40.8%) with vertebroplasty, 97 (26.7%) with balloon kyphoplasty, and 56 (15.4%) with sky bone expander. We found significant improvements in Visual Analog Score, Oswestry Disability Index, and Short-Form-36 scores for all groups after 1-month follow-up (P<0.05), with the surgical groups demonstrating a greater improvement in pain scores after the first postoperative day (P<0.0001) when compared with the conservative group. The improvements in outcomes in those treated surgically were sustained for up to 2 years with no significant difference (P>0.05) among the surgical groups. We also found significant improvement (P<0.005) in anterior vertebral and kyphotic wedge angle after surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that early surgical intervention allows for quicker pain relief compared with conservative treatment, with similar improvements in anterior vertebral height and kyphotic wedge angle between all 3 groups of surgical management.",eng,1.0

Kallmes,2010.0,Incident vertebral fractures in patients not undergoing vertebroplasty,10.1016/j.jvir.2010.02.012,"PURPOSE: To determine whether vertebroplasty increases the risk of new (ie, incident) vertebral fractures by comparing the rates of incident fractures among a group of patients with painful vertebral fractures who did not undergo vertebroplasty with a group of patients who did. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed to identify new-onset fractures after initial vertebroplasty evaluation in two groups, including patients who underwent vertebroplasty within 1 week of initial evaluation (group 1) and those who did not (group 2). Group 2 was further limited to patients with acute or subacute prevalent fractures (group 2A) after exclusion of those with exclusively chronic prevalent fractures. Survival analyses were performed to compare time to diagnosis and frequency of incident fractures in these three groups of patients. RESULTS: Group 1 included 269 patients, group 2 included 107 patients, and group 2A included 82 patients. Compared with group 2, incident fractures in group 1 occurred significantly earlier (log-rank statistic, 0.01) and more frequently (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-8.4). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute or subacute vertebral fractures presenting for consideration of vertebroplasty, those who undergo the procedure experience more and earlier incident fractures than those who do not, but the observed differences failed to reach statistical significance. Further work is needed in this area to better define relative risks of incident fracture between treated and nontreated patients.",eng,1.0

Twelve patients with bilateral sacral fractures were treated by augmentation with radiofrequency-activated, high-viscosity polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement under local anesthesia. CT-guided sacroplasty was performed by using a long-axis approach through a single entry point. Thirty-six vertebrae were treated in 12 sessions under a combination of CT and fluoroscopic guidance using a bilateral access and a cavity-creating osteotome prior to remote-controlled, hydraulically driven cement injection. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score before sacroplasty and at 1 and 3 months after the treatment was obtained. PMMA leaks were evaluated retrospectively using the post-interventional CT. The mean amount of high-viscosity PMMA injected per patient was 7.8 ml. No major adverse events were observed. In the first 4 days after the procedure, the mean VAS score decreased from 8.1 +/- 1.9 to mean 3.1 +/- 1.2 and was followed by a gradual but continuous decrease throughout the rest of the follow-up period at 24 weeks (mean 2.2 +/- 1.1) and 48 weeks (mean 2.1 +/- 1.4).

METHODS All patients treated with kyphoplasty for osteoporotic single-segment fractures between January 2007 and August 2012 were included in this retrospective study. The patients received either kyphoplasty alone (kyphoplasty group) or kyphoplasty with additional vertebroplasty of the adjacent segment (vertebroplasty group). The segmental kyphosis with the rate of adjacent-segment fractures (ASFs) and remote fractures were studied on plain lateral radiographs preoperatively, postoperatively, at 3 months, and at final follow-up. RESULTS Thirty-seven (82%) of a possible 45 patients were included for the analysis, with a mean follow-up of 16 months (range 3-54 months). The study population included 31 women, and the mean age of the total patient population was 72 years old (range 53-86 years). In 21 patients (57%), the fracture was in the thoracolumbar junction. Eighteen patients were treated with additional vertebroplasty and 19 with kyphoplasty only. The segmental kyphosis increased in both groups at final follow-up. A fracture through the primary treated vertebra (kyphoplasty) was found in 4 (22%) of the vertebroplasty group and in 3 (16%) of the kyphoplasty group (p = 0.6). An ASF was found in 50% (n = 9) of the vertebroplasty group and in 16% (n = 3) of the kyphoplasty group (p = 0.03). Remote fractures occurred in 1 patient in each group (p = 1.0). CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic vertebroplasty of the adjacent vertebra in patients with single-segment osteoporotic fractures as performed in this study did not decrease the rate of adjacent fractures. Based on these retrospective data, the possible benefits of prophylactic vertebroplasty do not compensate for the possible risks of an additional cement augmentation.",eng,0.0

Vrionis,2011.0,Balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of metastatic tumors of the upper thoracic spine,10.3171/2010.11.spine09909,"OBJECT: Balloon kyphoplasty has recently been shown to be effective in providing rapid pain relief and enhancing health-related quality of life in patients with metastatic spinal tumors. When performed to treat lesions of the upper thoracic spine, kyphoplasty poses certain technical challenges because of the smaller size of the pedicle and vertebral bodies. Fluoroscopic visualization is also difficult due to interference of the shoulder. The authors' objective in the present study was to evaluate their approach and the results of balloon kyphoplasty in the upper thoracic spine in patients with metastatic spinal disease. METHODS: Fourteen patients underwent kyphoplasty via an extrapedicular approach to treat metastatic tumors in the upper (T1-5) thoracic spine. Electrodiagnostic monitoring (somatosensory and motor evoked potentials) was used in 5 cases. Three levels were treated in 7 cases, 2 levels in 2 cases, and 1 level in 5 cases. In 3 cases access was bilateral, whereas in 11 cases access was unilateral. The procedure took an average of 25 minutes per treated level, and the mean amount of cement applied was 3 ml per level. Four patients were discharged from the hospital on the day of the procedure, and 10 patients went home after 24 hours. RESULTS: All patients exhibited marked improvement in mean visual analog scale scores (preoperative score 79 vs postoperative score 30, respectively) and Oswestry Disability Index scores (83 vs 33, respectively). The mean kyphotic angle was 25.03 degrees preoperatively, whereas the mean postoperative angle was 22.65 degrees (p > 0.3). At latest follow-up, the mean kyphotic angle did not differ significantly from the postoperative kyphotic angle (26.3 degrees , p > 0.1). No neurological deficits or lung-related complications (pneumothorax or hemothorax) were encountered in any of the patients. Polymethylmethacrylate cement extravasations were observed in 3 (10%) of 30 treated vertebral bodies without any sequelae. By a mean follow-up of 16 months, no patients had experienced an adjacent-level fracture. CONCLUSIONS: Balloon kyphoplasty of the upper thoracic spine via an extrapedicular approach is an efficient and safe minimally invasive procedure that may provide immediate and long-term pain relief and improvement in functional ability. It is technically challenging and has the potential for serious complications. With a fundamental knowledge of anatomy, as well as an ability to interpret fluoroscopy images, one can feasibly and safely perform balloon kyphoplasty in the upper thoracic spine.",eng,0.0

DESIGN, PATIENTS, INTERVENTIONS, MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The present study compared three commercially available vertebral augmentation systems: balloon kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty and shield kyphoplasty. The primary objective was to assess change in subjective severity of backache on a visual analog scale (VAS) and subjective improvement in quality of life on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), at a mean 6 months post-surgery. The secondary objective was to analyze current radiological imaging (X-ray, and in some cases CT) with regard to height restoration, cement distribution and leakage and recurrent fracture. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 5.8 months. Mean preoperative Beck vertebral height index did not significantly differ between the three augmentation system groups (P>0.05). Comparing surgery time, fluoroscopy time and dose-area-product (cGy x cm(2)) showed a statistically significant difference (P<0.01) in favor of the vertebroplasty technique. Augmentation provided significant improvement in VAS pain assessment, but with no significant difference between augmentation systems. Results on the ODI were less pronounced, with significant improvement of 22% to 45%, but again without significant difference between augmentation systems.

Journal Article,K. S. Eom; T. Y. Kim,2012.0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty-induced adjacent vertebral compression fracture,", ","BACKGROUND: The risks associated with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) are low. Patients show marked improvement and are able to rapidly resume normal activities after PV. The sudden development of postoperative vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is a common complication, and additional PV is frequently performed in these cases. However, there have been no studies reporting acute compression fractures of an adjacent vertebra immediately after PV. OBJECTIVE: This case report presents a rare case in which the patient had to undergo a second PV because of PV-induced adjacent VCF. Further, we review previous studies and discuss the possible pathogenesis of this rare complication. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Pain management clinic. METHODS: A 62-year-old woman presented with a severe pain in the lower back, which started after she slipped. A radiograph showed severe vertebral collapse with a vertebral vacuum cleft in the T12 vertebral body. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed low signal intensity in T12, suggesting acute VCF, but the signals from the other vertebrae were normal. RESULTS: The patient underwent PV at T12. When the cannula was inserted into the fracture line of the vertebral body, reduction of the collapsed T12 was developed. Although the postoperative course was uneventful, the patient's pain did not resolve. Postoperative radiographic image obtained 4 hours after the PV showed reduction of T12 and adjacent acute VCF in T11. We performed a second PV at T11. However, 2 weeks later, adjacent acute VCF in L1 was developed and PV was performed. LIMITATIONS: This report describes a single case. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of adjacent VCF that developed almost immediately after PV. Although the exact mechanism underlying this rare complication remains unclear, we assume that the VCF was induced by PV, although this was not proven. However, we suggest that the insertion of the cannula into the fracture line induced the iatrogenic dynamic mobility of the fractured vertebra. Reduction was caused by the cannula and positional gravity. The upward reduction may have had an effect on the upper and adjacent vertebrae.",eng,0.0

However, myeloma-induced effects on the bone-active cells in the bone marrow are more than just a manifestation of disease--the myeloma derives essential support from the changed balance between bone-forming and -resorbing cells. This observation has lead to the notion that effective control of myeloma bone disease by reducing osteoclast activity and restoring osteoblast activity will contribute to long-term control of myeloma progression. Unlike osteolysis associated with other tumors that metastasize to bone, myeloma-associated lytic lesions are unique in that they do not repair even after many years in complete remission, reflecting a total loss of osteoblastic activity in areas of myeloma foci, apparently induced by the myeloma. Advances in imaging technology including positron emission tomography-computed tomography scanning allows accurate detection of lytic lesions and the monitoring of treatment effects. Effective antimyeloma therapy combined with anti-osteoclast drugs can halt the progression of osteolysis; in severe cases with vertebral compression fractures, effective physical support in the form of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is required for control of function, pain, and stature. Fractures of the long bones are usually treated by intramedullary rod placement. New approaches to enhance osteoblast activity while controlling osteoclast activity currently under investigation may prove effective in controlling lytic bone disease and myeloma progression.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of RF-TVA in patients with malignant VCFs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The use of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty for patients with recalcitrant pain after acute VCFs is shown to be safe, successful in stabilizing the VCF, and effective for the relief of pain after osteoporotic and malignant VCFs. RF-TVA using targeted cavity creation and ultrahigh viscosity PMMA delivery with a long handling time was developed to address the potential adverse issues that arise with vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty. METHODS: Between December 2008 and May 2009, a consecutive series of 66 RF-TVA procedures were performed by the authors for VCF secondary to multiple myeloma. Pre- and postoperatively, a standard 10-point visual analogue scale was used to assess back pain. Pain medication use and activity categories were defined and monitored for changes before and after RF-TVA. All patients were followed for 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: At 6 months postoperatively, significant improvement in pain, activity, and narcotic use was observed. There were no pulmonary or neurological complications, and one patient had radiographical evidence of asymptomatic leakage of PMMA into the vertebral disc space. CONCLUSION: We report optimum safety and efficacy results in the treatment of malignant VCFs with a novel RF-TVA technique in which controlled delivery of an ultrahigh viscosity PMMA is used for fracture stabilization. The deposition of PMMA with RF-TVA is predictable and uniform, and can be performed without the PMMA handling constraints that may be encountered with vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty. The safety and efficacy we report with RF-TVA achieved equivalency with other methods of treatment for VCF stabilization.",eng,1.0

Acute versus chronic compression fractures,", ","The objective of this prospective consecutive cohort study was to compare the clinical outcomes, the radiographic outcomes and the complication rates of symptomatic acute (< 10 weeks) and chronic (> 16 weeks) osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) treated with kyphoplasty. Twenty-eight consecutive patients had 52 symptomatic osteoporotic VCFs treated with kyphoplasty; 5 of these patients were treated in two sessions. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for back pain, a Visual Analog Scale for pain assessment, a patients' satisfaction scale, and medication usage served to evaluate the clinical outcomes. All these variables improved significantly in both groups, and more so in the acute group, but the difference was most often not significant. Vertebral height, local kyphosis angle, global sagittal alignment and dynamic fracture mobility significantly improved in both groups (except global sagittal alignment), and again more so in the acute group (except global sagittal alignment); the difference between groups was significant regarding radiological variables, except global sagittal alignment. Timing of kyphoplasty certainly matters, as the clinical and radiological outcomes were mostly better in acute fractures than in chronic fractures, which somehow responded satisfactorily. Controlled studies (kyphoplasty versus natural history) are needed to establish the real value of the procedure.",eng,0.0

Kypho-/vertebroplasty as standard operative procedures are associated with limitations like cement leakage, limited reduction capabilities, and risk for adjacent fractures. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a new minimal invasive cementless VCF fixation technique. METHODS: Four patients (72.3 years, range 70-76) with VCFs type AO/Muller A1.3 and concomitant osteoporosis were treated by minimal invasive transpedicular placement of two intervertebral mesh cages for fracture reduction and maintenance. Follow-up included functional/radiological assessment and clinical scores and averaged 27.7 months (24-28). RESULTS: Endplate reduction was achieved in all cases (mean surgery time: 28.5 minutes). Kyphotic (KA) and Cobb angle revealed considerable improvements postoperatively (KA 14.5 degrees to 10.7 degrees /Cobb 10.1 degrees to 8.3 degrees ). Slight loss of vertebral reduction (KA: 12.6 degrees ) and segment rekyphosis (Cobb: 10.7 degrees ) were observed for final follow-up. Pain improved from 8.8 to 2.8 (visual analogue scale). All cases showed signs of bony healing. No perioperative complications and no adjacent fractures occurred. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results in a small, selected patient collective indicate the ability of bony healing for osteoporotic VCFs. Cementless fixation using intravertebral titanium mesh cages revealed substantial pain relief, adequate reduction, and reduction maintenance without complications.

Current treatment strategies focus on cement-associated solutions (kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty techniques). Specific cement-associated problems as leakage, embolism and the adjacent fracture disease are reported adding to open questions like general fracture healing properties of the osteoporotic spine. In order to analyze those queries animal models are of great interest; however, both technical difficulties in the induction of experimental osteoporosis in animal as well as the lack of a standardized fracture model impede current and future in vivo studies. This study introduces a standardized animal model of an osteoporotic VCF type A3.1 that may enable further in-depth analysis of the afore mentioned topics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four 5-year-old female Merino sheep (mean body weight: 67 kg; range 57-79) were ovariectomized (OP1) and underwent 5.5 months of weekly corticosteroid injections (dexamethasone and dexamethasone-sodium-phosphate), adding to a calcium/phosphorus/vitamin D-deficient diet. Osteoporosis induction was documented by pQCT and micro-CT BMD (bone mineral density) as well as 3D histomorphometric analysis postoperatively of the sheep distal radius and spine. Non osteoporotic sheep served as controls. Induction of a VCF of the second lumbar vertebra was performed via a mini-lumbotomy surgical approach with a standardized manual compression mode (OP2). RESULTS: PQCT analysis revealed osteoporosis of the distal radius with significantly reduced BMD values (0.19 g/cm(3), range 0.13-0.22 vs. 0.27 g/cm(3), range 0.23-0.32). Micro-CT documented significant lowering of BMD values for the second lumbar vertebrae (0.11 g/cm(3), range 0.10-0.12) in comparison to the control group (0.14 g/cm(3), range 0.12-0.17). An incomplete burst fracture type A3.1 was achieved in all cases and resulted in a significant decrease in body angle and vertebral height (KA 4.9 degrees , range: 2-12; SI 4.5%, range: 2-12). With OP1, one minor complication (lesion of small bowel) occurred, while no complications occurred with OP2. CONCLUSIONS: A suitable spinal fracture model for creation of VCFs in osteoporotic sheep was developed. The technique may promote the development of improved surgical solutions for VCF treatment in the experimental and clinical setting.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included seven university-based and private hospitals in the United States. Of 488 consecutive patients (mean age, 76 years) who underwent percutaneous PMMA vertebroplasty between 1996 and 1999, 245 were successfully interviewed retrospectively after vertebroplasty (median time, 7 months). Through telephone interview, patients completed our self-developed questionnaire designed to measure pain (10-point scale), ambulation (five-point scale), and ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) (five-point scale) before and after vertebroplasty. Differences in reported pain, ambulation, and ability to perform ADL before and after vertebroplasty were evaluated with paired t tests. Differences in proportions were compared with the McNemar test. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the consistency of differences in pre- and postprocedural pain and functional status by patient age, number of fractures, time from fracture to vertebroplasty, and time from vertebroplasty to questionnaire completion. RESULTS: On a 10-point scale, mean pain decreased from 8.9 before vertebroplasty to 3.4 afterward (P <.001). Seventy-two percent of patients had substantially impaired ambulation before vertebroplasty compared with 28% afterward (P <.001). Ability to perform ADL was also significantly improved following vertebroplasty (P <.001). Twelve patients (4.9%) experienced symptomatic complications (none major or life threatening).

There exists no standard instrument with which to measure pain and functional status before and after treatment of VCFs. METHODS: A questionnaire was specifically developed to assess pain and disability in patients with VCFs before and after undergoing percutaneous polymethylmethacrylate-augmented vertebroplasty. The first section of the baseline questionnaire (before treatment) contains 11 items that address the patient's previous and current levels of back pain and distress. The second section of the baseline questionnaire lists 24 activities of daily living (ADLs), each measured on a four-point scale ranging from able to do without pain"" to ""cannot do because of pain."" The follow-up questionnaire (after treatment) is similar in format. Among 72 vertebroplasty-treated patients, the internal consistency reliability of the 24 ADLs ranged from 0.87 to 0.98, with similar results observed before and after treatment. Correlations of 0.29 to 0.72 were observed among the 24 ADLs and the internal measures of pain and distress measured on both visual analog and adjectival scales. Similar correlations (range 0.35-0.63) were observed between the questionnaire and 10 dimensions of the Oswestry Disability Index's low-back pain questionnaire, an external instrument used to assess criterion-referenced validity. Evidence in support of the validity of the questionnaire was present before and after treatment.

We describe the pain and functional status of 72 patients before and after vertebroplasty, as prospectively evaluated by the Vertebral Compression Fracture Pain and Functional Disability Questionnaire. METHODS: Of 161 consecutive patients, 72 consented to participate in the study and self-completed the questionnaire prior to undergoing vertebroplasty. Differences in pain and distress before and after vertebroplasty, and between the first and second follow-up intervals, were evaluated. Mean scores for each of 24 activities of daily living (ADLs) were plotted at the baseline and first and second follow-up intervals. RESULTS: The mean (SD) patient age was 74 (10) years; 80% were female. On the 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as it could be) visual analog pain scale, patients reported significantly more pain, on average, before undergoing percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) than at the first follow-up interval (mean 5.8 vs 3.5, p<0.001). The reduction in reported pain following vertebroplasty persisted at the second follow-up on both the visual analog and adjectival pain scales.

Outcomes were assessed at 3 days, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year following the procedure. RESULTS: 115 subjects were enrolled in the trial with 59 (51.3%) randomly assigned to kyphoplasty and 56 (48.7%) assigned to vertebroplasty.

AVN is characterized by production of gas that outlines a radiolucent zone in the vertebral body, called vacuum cleft sign (VCS) or Kummell's sign"". This sign has been observed in up to one-third of VCFs and is often associated with osteoporosis and never with malignant or inflammatory diseases. Generally, treatment strategies are conservative management and percutaneous vertebroplasty. Teriparatide (rhPTH [1-34]) is an osteoanabolic agent approved for treatment of osteoporosis and helpful in fracture's healing too. Here, we describe the case of an 81-year-old osteoporotic woman presented with a 1-year history of persistent low back pain onset after a trauma. A lumbar spine Computer Tomography (CT) scan performed 2 months after the injury (November 2006) showed the VCS within a VCF of the first lumbar vertebra; a control CT scan 1 year later showed persistence of the finding. After 12 months of treatment with teriparatide 20 mcg/day, symptoms disappeared and vacuum was significantly reduced. In conclusion, Kummell's disease may be hypothesized in patients with chronic spinal symptoms, especially in the presence of osteoporosis. Moreover in this condition, osteoanabolic treatment may be used in patients with Kummell's disease to enhance vertebral fracture's healing and contribute to back pain relief.""",eng,0.0
Journal Article,L. Fabeck,2008.0,[Treatment of osteoporotic fractures. A new approach by vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty],", ","Osteoporosis is a systemic disease and results in progressive bone mineral loss and concurrent change in bone architecture that leave bone vulnerable to fracture. In one third of patients with acute vertebral fracture, severe pain and limited mobility persist despite appropriate nonoperative management. Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive method that involved the percutaneous injection of cement into a collapsed vertebral body to stabilize the fractured vertebra. The indication of this technique is a painful fracture after 8 weeks of conservative treatment. Contraindications include coagulopathy, absence of facilities to perform emergency decompressive surgery, a vertebral collapse greater than 65 % and a fracture of the vertebra posterior wall. The procedure results in quick, effective pain relief and complications as epidural leakage or thermal necrosis by cement extravasation are rare. Vertebroplasty does not expand the collapsed vertebra. Kyphoplasty is a modification of this first technique and offers potential advantages as lower risk of cement extravasation and better restoration of the vertebral body height. A cannula is introduced into the vertebral body via a transpedicular approach like for the vertebroplasty technique but it is followed by insertion of an inflatable bone tamp, which when deployed reduces partially the compression fracture. This then creates a cavity to be filled with bone cement. Considering the higher rates of morbidity or mortality that is associated with osteoporotic fractures, early mobilization in these patients is of prime importance and can be achieved by using each of this two techniques with a relative low complication rate.",fre,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To introduce unconstrained 6 degrees of freedom biomechanical testing to investigate whether vertebroplasty lowered the fracture strength of adjacent untreated vertebrae under physiological loading conditions and to describe the observed fracture pattern. METHODS: Three-level spinal segments (T10-12 and L1-3) from 6 spines were tested under unconstrained axial compression in which shear forces and torque were minimized using a 6-degrees of freedom robotic arm. Fracture initiation loads and ultimate failure loads of lumbar segments were predicted from the corresponding thoracic segments by assuming constant fracture stress along the spinal column. The predicted values were compared with postvertebroplasty experimental values of the lumbar spine segments. Plain radiographs were taken at 600-N increments to record the developing fracture pattern. RESULTS: All 6 vertebroplasty group specimens experienced reductions in fracture strengths ranging from 27.4% to 47.6% with an average decrease of 32.6% (P < .002) and reductions in ultimate failure load ranging from 1.6% to 47.3%, with an average decrease of 34.7% (P < .003) compared with predicted values from the nonvertebroplasty group. In all vertebroplasty group specimens, the superior and inferior endplates of the untreated middle vertebral body (L2) were deflected, whereas 5 of the 6 nonvertebroplasty group specimens did not show any evidence of endplate deflection. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty altered the load transfer along the anterior spinal column, thereby statistically significantly increasing fracture risk and ultimate failure load of the untreated adjacent vertebrae. The radiographic findings support the endplate deflection fracture mechanism as the cause of adjacent fractures after vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

These fractures result in both acute and chronic pain. Patients who sustain such fractures are known to suffer from more comorbidities and have a higher mortality rate compared with healthy people in the same age group. In recent years, balloon kyphoplasty has become a popular method for treating vertebral compression fractures. However, as longer-term follow-up becomes available, the effects of cement augmentation on adjacent spinal segments require investigation. Here, we have performed a retrospective chart review of 258 consecutive patients with pathologic vertebral compression fractures secondary to osteoporosis, treated by either conservative measures or balloon kyphoplasty with polymethylmethacrylate cement augmentation. Multivariate analysis of patient comorbidities was performed to assess the risks associated with subsequent adjacent and remote compression fracture at a minimum of 2 years follow-up. A total of 258 patients had 361 vertebral compression fractures. A total of 121 patients were treated nonoperatively and 137 underwent balloon kyphoplasty with polymethylmethacrylate cement augmentation. The mean follow-up for both cohorts was 2.7 years (range, 2-6 years). The kyphoplasty cohort was significantly older than the nonoperative cohort (mean age, 78.5 versus 74.2 years; p = 0.02), had 24 more patients with diabetes mellitus (37 versus 13; p = 0.05), and had 34 more patients with a history of smoking (50 versus 16; p = 0.05). However, the kyphoplasty cohort had less patients with a history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (45 versus 71; p = 0.07). There were no demographic differences between groups in patients with secondary fractures. Nonoperative treatment was identified as a statistically significant independent risk factor for subsequent vertebral compression fracture [odds ratio (OR), 2.28]. Univariate analysis identified age, diabetes mellitus, smoking, NSAID usage, and female gender as risk factors for subsequent vertebral compression fracture. When adjusted for multivariate analysis, no individual factor demonstrated increased risk for subsequent fracture. Patients diagnosed with vertebral compression fractures secondary to osteoporosis suffer from multiple medical comorbidities. No particular comorbidity was identified as solely attributable for increased risk of subsequent remote or adjacent compression fractures. Patients in this series treated with nonoperative (conservative) management had a 2.28 times greater risk for a subsequent vertebral compression fracture than patients treated with balloon kyphoplasty and polymethylmethacrylate cement augmentation.",eng,0.0

Various vertebral kyphoplasty surgeries, which have their own unique features, are commonly used for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. Based on the anatomic property of the thoracolumbar vertebral pedicle that its horizontal diameter is twice that of the vertical diameter, we designed Jack vertebral dilator for better restoration of the vertebral height by manipulating the mechanical force. METHODS: A total of 218 patients (236 vertebrae) with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were treated with Jack vertebral dilator. Surgery was successfully completed in all cases, and all the 218 patients were followed up for an average of 14.2 months (range 3 to 30 months). RESULTS: Bone cement leakage occurred in 12 cases, but no symptoms were reported. No other complications were noticed. The VAS scores were 8.2 +/- 1.3, 1.7 +/- 0.9, and 1.8 +/- 0.8 and the ODI was 78.2 +/- 13.3 %, 18.5 +/- 7.3 %, and 20.9 +/- 6.8 % before surgery and 1 week after surgery and at the final follow-up, respectively.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of radiological and clinical parameters was performed on 388 patients who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty to treat osteoporotic compression fractures from January 2010 to October 2012. IVC sign was observed in the MRI of 47 patients. Postoperative follow-ups were conducted for at least 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: IVC incidence was associated with older age and lower bone mineral density. Other baseline measurements, such as preoperative visual analogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), showed no significant difference between IVC and non-IVC fracture patients. Vertebral height and kyphotic angle were corrected after percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty with no significant difference in outcome between the two procedures. Restored vertebral height collapsed and the kyphotic angle became aggravated during the 2 years following surgery in patients with IVC. Similarly, initial improvements in visual analogue scale and ODI decreased over time. Non-IVC patients' had a slight recurrence of compression and kyphosis that began to normalize after 1 year. Visual analogue scale and ODI at 2 years' post-surgery was also significantly lower in non-IVC than IVC patients. CONCLUSION: Polymethylmethacrylate vertebroplasty treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures is initially effective for patients with signs of IVC, but compression and kyphosis gradually reoccur.

METHODS: In this study, 76 elderly patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures undergoing percutaneous kyphoplasty were followed up for 2-3.1 years. They were divided into 3 groups according to different ages: 60-69 yrs (A group), 70-79 yrs (B group) and 80- 91 yrs (C group). Pre- and post-operative and last follow-up evaluations were conducted. And the parameters of bone mineral density (BMD), kyphotic angle, change of visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index, average vertebral body height, complications and costs of hospitalization were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: BMD decreased with advancing age and had statistical significance between three groups (P < 0.05). Three thoracic spine fractures and 6 lumbar spine fractures could not be detected with digital radiography and were observed only on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The pre-operative levels of visual analogue scale and Oswestry disability index increased in all groups.No statistical significance existed between A and B groups. But there was statistical significance between A or B and C groups (P < 0.05). Pre- and post-operative assessments showed that statistically significant improvements were found in visual analogue scale and Oswestry disability index in all groups (P < 0.05). And statistically significant improvements were found for the pre- and post-operative kyphotic angles and vertebral body heights in A, C group and B groups (P < 0.05). The sites for symptomatic leakage of cement included paravertebral vein (n = 2), intervertebral disc (n = 1) and paravertebral space (n = 2). Adjacent vertebral fracture occurred in 1 patient at 17 months and underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty. The mean operative duration was 28 minutes per vertebrae and the mean cost of hospitalization at RMB yuan 33 778. CONCLUSION: As a simple and safe procedure for osteoporotic vertebrae compression fractures, percutaneous kyphoplasty may relieve pain quickly, restore vertebral height, prevent further fractures and improve the patient's quality-of-life.",chi,0.0

Lu,2014.0,Biomechanical evaluation of an injectable and biodegradable copolymer P(PF-co-CL) in a cadaveric vertebral body defect model,10.1089/ten.TEA.2013.0275,"A novel biodegradable copolymer, poly(propylene fumarate-co-caprolactone) [P(PF-co-CL)], has been developed in our laboratory as an injectable scaffold for bone defect repair. In the current study, we evaluated the ability of P(PF-co-CL) to reconstitute the load-bearing capacity of vertebral bodies with lytic lesions. Forty vertebral bodies from four fresh-frozen cadaveric thoracolumbar spines were used for this study. They were randomly divided into four groups: intact vertebral body (intact control), simulated defect without treatment (negative control), defect treated with P(PF-co-CL) (copolymer group), and defect treated with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA group). Simulated metastatic lytic defects were made by removing a central core of the trabecular bone in each vertebral body with an approximate volume of 25% through an access hole in the side of the vertebrae. Defects were then filled by injecting either P(PF-co-CL) or PMMA in situ crosslinkable formulations. After the spines were imaged with quantitative computerized tomography, single vertebral body segments were harvested for mechanical testing. Specimens were compressed until failure or to 25% reduction in body height and ultimate strength and elastic modulus of each specimen were then calculated from the force-displacement data. The average failure strength of the copolymer group was 1.83 times stronger than the untreated negative group and it closely matched the intact vertebral bodies (intact control). The PMMA-treated vertebrae, however, had a failure strength 1.64 times larger compared with the intact control. The elastic modulus followed the same trend. This modulus mismatch between PMMA-treated vertebrae and the host vertebrae could potentially induce a fracture cascade and degenerative changes in adjacent intervertebral discs. In contrast, P(PF-co-CL) restored the mechanical properties of the treated segments similar to the normal, intact, vertebrae. Therefore, P(PF-co-CL) may be a suitable alternative to PMMA for vertebroplasty treatment of vertebral bodies with lytic defects.",eng,1.0

Dolan,2005.0,Can vertebroplasty restore normal load-bearing to fractured vertebrae?,", ","STUDY DESIGN: Cadaver motion segments were used to evaluate the effects of vertebroplasty on spinal loading following vertebral fracture. OBJECTIVES: To determine if vertebroplasty reverses fracture-induced changes in the distribution of compressive stress in cadaver motion segments. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty involves reinforcement of vertebrae by injection of cement and is now being used increasingly to treat osteoporotic vertebral fractures. However, its effects on spinal load-bearing are largely unknown. We hypothesize that vertebroplasty, following vertebral fracture, helps to equalize stress acting on the intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebral bodies. METHODS: Nineteen cadaver thoracolumbar motion segments (age 64-90 years) were induced to fracture by compressive overload. Specimens were then subjected to vertebroplasty, and subsequently creep loaded for 1 hour at 1.5 kN. The compressive stress acting on the intervertebral disc was measured before and after fracture, after vertebroplasty, and after creep, by pulling a pressure transducer mounted in a 1.3-mm needle across the disc's midsagittal diameter. This information was then used to calculate neural arch load-bearing. At each time point, measurements were also made of compressive stiffness. RESULTS: Vertebral fracture reduced motion segment compressive stiffness, decompressed the adjacent nucleus, increased stress concentrations in the posterior anulus, and increased neural arch load-bearing, all by a significant amount. Vertebroplasty partially, but significantly, reversed all of these fracture-induced changes. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty reduces stress concentrations in the anulus and neural arch resulting in a more even distribution of compressive stress on the intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebral bodies.",eng,1.0

This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) versus optimal medical therapy (OMT) in controlling pain and improving the quality of life (QOL) in patients with VCFs. Efficacy was measured as the incidence of new vertebral fractures after PV, restoration of vertebral body height (VBH), and correction of deformity. METHODS: Of 105 patients with acute osteoporotic VCFs, 82 were eligible for participation: 40 patients underwent PV and 42 received OMT. Primary outcomes were control of pain and improvement in QOL before treatment, and these were measured at 1 week and at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the beginning of the treatment. Radiological evaluation to measure VBH and sagittal index was performed before and after treatment in both groups and after 36 months of follow-up. RESULTS: The authors found a statistically significant improvement in pain in the PV group compared with the OMT group at 1 week (difference -3.1, 95% CI -3.72 to -2.28; p < 0.001). The QOL improved significantly in the PV group (difference -14, 95% CI -15 to -12.82; p < 0.028). One week after PV, the average VBH restoration was 8 mm and the correction of deformity was 8 degrees . The incidence of new fractures in the OMT group (13.3%) was higher than in the PV group (2.2%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The PV group had statistically significant improvements in visual analog scale and QOL scores maintained over 24 months, improved VBH maintained over 36 months, and fewer adjacent-level fractures compared with the OMT group.",eng,1.0

METHODS: T10-L2 segment data were obtained from computed tomography (CT) scans of an elder female with single T12 OVCF undergoing a cement leakage into the T12-L1 disc after PKP. A three-dimensional finite element Model of thoracolumbar spine (T10-L2) was built in the Mimics and the ABAQUS software. The stress on annulus fiber, nucleus pulposus, endplate and facet joints under axial pressure (0.3, 1.0, 4.0 MPa) were analyzed. RESULTS: The 3D finite element after percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) with cement leakage into the disc may be strongly related with the changes of biomechanical effects on adjacent vertebra of thoracolumbar OVCF. Models of thoracolumbar OVCF before and after PVP with a cement leakage into the T12-L1 disc were successfully established. The stresses increased with a rising axial pressure in the model of cement leakage into the disc after PVP, the stress augmentation scope on adjacent end plates(T11 low plate & L1 top plate) and intervertebral disc (T11-12 & T12-L1) increased.

METHODS: Thoracolumbar spine segment data (Dicom format) were obtained from lamellar CT scanning of seven old female or male with single OVCF. A three-dimensional model of thoracolumbar spine and simulative PVP models (via double transpedicular approach) were built in the Mimics software. With the help of a preoperative transparent marker located at the back midline skin and preoperative digital design by Mimics software, the needle insert point and needle direction in every patient were established. The surgical time, the number of intraoperative radiation perspective, bone cement filling condition in fracture vertebra, intraoperative complications and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after surgery were recorded to evaluate the preliminary clinical results after modified PVP. RESULTS: The puncture process during PVP was in high accordance with the preoperative digital design by Mimics software in seven cases of single OVCF with the average age of 78 years old. The operation time was only 16.57+/-2.07 minutes and the intraoperative radiation perspective numbers were less than ten (7.86+/-1.68) times. The bone cement filling in all fracture vertebras were good and no surgical complications such as spine cord injury and cement leakage were founded. The VAS scores before and after surgery were 8.57+/-0.53 points and 1.43+/-0.53 point (P=0.000), respectively.

METHODS: Detailed searches for English-language and German-language articles published between 2002 and 2009 were performed in a number of electronic databases. Because of the large number of case series, we considered only systematic reviews and controlled studies. The internal validity of reviews and studies was judged by two authors independently. Data extraction was performed by one author, and extracted data were checked for completeness and correctness by a second author. RESULTS: A total of eight systematic reviews, primarily summarizing results from case series, and 11 controlled studies, two of which were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), were included. Both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty significantly reduce pain in the majority of patients and can lead to short-term and possibly long-term improvement of function. Kyphoplasty induces fewer clinically relevant complications than vertebroplasty does, and there is presently stronger evidence for its efficacy compared with vertebroplasty. There is inconclusive evidence about the risk of new fractures after kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. CONCLUSION: Both procedures seem to be equally effective, but kyphoplasty is safer than vertebroplasty. New results, specifically from RCTs comparing the two procedures, are needed to provide more definitive data.",ger,0.0

METHODS: Recruited were 132 senile patients with OVCF who were willing to receive minimally invasive therapy were assigned to the comprehensive treatment group and the percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) group. The 89 vertebral bodies in the 68 cases of the comprehensive treatment group received restitution combined with PVP, while the 81 vertebral bodies in the 64 cases of the control PKP group received PKP alone. All patients completed the follow-ups for more than 3 years. The therapeutic efficacy was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), Cobb's angle, the height ratios of the diseased vertebral anterior edge and middle edge. The operation time for a single centrum, the perspective time during the operation, the incidence of bone cement leakage, the injection rate of the bone cement, the cost of hospitalization, and the hospital days were compared between t he comprehensive treatment group and the PKP group. RESULTS: Compared with before treatment in the same group, the VAS and ODI were significantly lower, the height ratios of the diseased vertebral anterior edge and middle edge, and the Cobb's angle were obviously improved in the two groups, showing statistical difference (P < 0.01).

A novel vertebral augmentation technique radiofrequency kyphoplasty (RFK) with high viscosity cement was developed in 2009. Here, we aim to evaluate whether RFK can relieve symptoms efficiently and reduce cement leakage. METHODS: A literature search was performed using Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL until September 30, 2016. Both randomized controlled trial (RCT) and non-RCT studies comparing RFK and BKP were included. The main outcomes included pain relief (VAS), functionality improvement (ODI), operation time, reduction of deformity (vertebral height and kyphosis angle), and incidence of cement leakage. The origin of heterogeneity was further explored by subgroup stratification. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies involving 833 patients with VCFs were included. The reduction of VAS score in the RFK group was 3.96 points more than that in the BKP group (P = .0007) postoperatively, and the improvement persisted until 12 months after the surgery (P < .00001). The operation time was shorter in RFK group than that in BKP group (P = .01). The increase of anterior vertebral height shortly after the operation was 0.53 mm greater in RFK group (P = .01). The decrease of kyphotic angle after RFK was 0.63 degrees and 0.92 degrees greater than that after BKP, both immediately and 6 months after operation (P = .002 and P < .00001, respectively). There was no significant difference between the incidence of cement leakage after RFK and BKP (P = .06). Further subgroup analysis stratified by study design indicated that the incidence of leakage decreased 15% in RFK than BPK (P < .00001) in non-RCT subgroup, but RFK and BKP treatments were equivalent in the RCT studies (P = .86). CONCLUSION: RFK appears to be more effective and safer than BKP in the present meta-analysis.

RESULTS: The incidence of cement extrusion was 16.7% with KP, comparing with PV, it was 27.3% using the SOC (P<0.05) and 68,0% with the FOC (P<0.05), but comparing SOC with FOC, the cement extrusion was significantly lower using the SOC (P<0.05), all asymptomatic. The pain control was similar for all groups (P<0.05), with good improvement of pain in most of the patients, and there were no clinical relevant complications. CONCLUSION: The cement leakage was significantly reduced with the KP (16.7%) and the SOC (27.3%) for PV, in comparison with the FOC (68.0%). The cement extrusion was slightly lower with KP, but not a significant difference, comparing with SOC, increasing the safety of the procedure using both the KP and this new SOC.",eng,0.0

In cases of previous pedicle screw instrumentation, vertebral body cannulation may be challenging. The authors describe, for the first time, an approach through the adjacent inferior vertebra and disc space in the thoracic spine for cement augmentation. A 78-year-old woman underwent posterior fusion with pedicle screws after vertebrectomy and reconstruction with cement and Steinmann pins for a pathological T-7 fracture. Two months later she developed a compression fracture of the vertebral body at the lower part of the construct, and a vertebroplasty was performed. Because a standard transpedicular route was not available, an inferior transdiscal trajectory was used for the cement injection. A 73-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis underwent cervicothoracic fusion posteriorly for subluxation. He developed pain in the upper thoracic area, and the authors performed a transdiscal vertebroplasty at T-2. The standard transpedicular route was not possible. The vertebral body was satisfactorily filled up with cement. Clinically both patients benefited significantly in terms of back pain and showed an uneventful follow-up of 3 months. Transdiscal vertebroplasty can achieve good results in the mid- and upper thoracic spine when a standard transpedicular trajectory is not possible, and can therefore be a good alternative in select cases.",eng,1.0

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients undergoing vesselplasty at our institution between April 2006 and February 2008 were enrolled in the study. All patients had been undergoing medical therapy for one or more painful VCFs. Pain, mobility, and analgesic use scores were obtained, and restoration of vertebral body height was evaluated. A two-tailed paired Student's t test was used to compare differences in the mean scores for levels of pain, mobility, and analgesic use before and after the procedure and to evaluate changes in vertebral body height. We analyzed the influence of the age of the fracture and its cause in the variations in the pain, mobility, and analgesic use scores. RESULTS: Seven of the 29 patients had fractures in more than one level, for a total of 37 procedures. The cause of the vertebral collapse was osteoporosis in 27 (73%), high-impact trauma in five (13.5%), myeloma in three (8%), and metastatic fracture in two (5.4%). The average pain score before treatment was 8.72 +/- 1.25 (SD), whereas the average pain score after treatment was 3.38 +/- 2.35. The average mobility score before treatment was 2.31 +/- 1.94, whereas the average mobility score after treatment was 0.59 +/- 1.05 (p < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to compare the overall cost, length of stay, and readmission data for patients hospitalized with painful osteoporotic VCFs, treated either medically or with inpatient VA. SETTING: A single academic medical center. STUDY DESIGN: Economic analysis METHODS: Patients admitted with VCF over a 30-month period were identified using ICD-9 codes. The total length of stay, hospitalization costs, average daily cost, and 30-day readmission rates were compared between those who underwent VA and those managed nonoperatively. A subgroup analysis was performed with an age matched group of controls as well. Two-tailed t-tests were used for statistical significance. RESULTS: Thirty-nine inpatients underwent VA; 61 levels were augmented. Their average age was 81.7 years. There were 209 patients who were treated nonoperatively for VCF. Their average age was 72.7 years, a significant age difference from the VA group (P < 0.01). The VA patients' average length of stay was 13.8 days, compared to 8.1 days in the medically managed group (P < 0.01). Average total costs were $26,074 in the VA group and $15,507 in the medically managed group (P < 0.01). The daily costs of admission were $2,040 in the VA group and $2,069 in the medically managed group (P = 0.85). The readmission rates related to VCF were 0% in the VA group; 5.2% in the medically managed group; and 7.7% in the age-matched control group. Of those who underwent VA, 43% experienced delays in care related to anticoagulation or medical comorbidities. LIMITATIONS: The study is retrospective and uses billing data as a marker for total cost of care, The study does not account for cost differences between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. CONCLUSION: Inpatient VA can be cost effective as demonstrated by the same daily cost between the VA and medically managed groups. Early identification and consultation can facilitate VA and rapid discharge. Anticoagulation issues and medical comorbidities can delay VA and lengthen hospital stays. Hospital admitted patients with painful osteoporotic VCF who are managed conservatively and discharged are at risk for readmission.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficiency and safety of two systems to treat OVCF: Confidence Vertebroplasty (CV) compared to Sky Kyphoplasty (SK). METHODS: This prospective study included 45 patients with OVCF. Fourteen were treated with CV and 31 with SK. An imaging evaluation using a compression ratio (height of anterior vs. posterior wall) and local kyphotic deformity (Cobb angle) was performed prior to the procedure and 12 months later. Evaluation of pain was carried out using a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: The mean compression repair was 12% in the CV group compared to 25% in the SK group. Mean kyphotic deformity restoration achieved using CV was 41% compared to 67% using SK. In both groups the pain severity was equally reduced by a mean of 43%. CONCLUSIONS: The SK system is technically superior in restoring the vertebral height and repairing the kyphotic deformity, an advantage that was not manifested in pain relief - the most important variable. Both systems have a high level of safety. The cost-benefit balance clearly favors the CV system.",eng,0.0

Forty consecutive patients with painful single level T12 or L1 osteoporotic VCF who had failed conservative management for more than 3 months had 40 single level SKy Bone Expander kyphoplasties performed. Using local anaesthesia with patients in a prone, hyper-lordotic position, a unilateral, percutaneous, intra-pedicular approach was employed. Once correctly positioned, the SKy Bone Expander was expanded, creating a void. It was subsequently contracted, removed and bone cement injected. Pre-kyphoplasty and 12-month post-kyphoplasty radiological and functional outcomes were recorded. Statistical analysis was by Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. Median percentage increase in anterior, middle and posterior vertebral body heights at 12-month post-operative was 51.25% [inter-quartile range (IQR) 17.21-93.22], 52.29% (IQR 26.50-126.17) and 9.84% (IQR 4.94-19.26) respectively, while median percentage decrease in kyphotic angle was 30.77% (IQR 17.06-46.61). There was no significant vertebral body correction loss at 12-month post-operative. Visual analogue score, North American Spine Society and Short Form-36 scores for physical functioning and bodily pain scores improved by medians of 5.0 (IQR 3.0-8.0), 1.45 (IQR 0.68-2.90), 20.5 (IQR 0.0-40.8) and 10.0 (IQR 0.0-20.0) respectively. All P-values were <0.001. There were eight adjacent/remote level VCFs, three cases of cement extravasation and one case of the SKy Bone Expander being unable to be contracted and withdrawn from the vertebral body. It was left in situ. This is the first reported incidence of such a complication. The SKy Bone Expander System appears to be a viable alternative to balloon tamp kyphoplasty. Important technical considerations include proper device positioning within the vertebral body before expansion, single use of devices, familiarity with salvage procedure and injection of bone cement under close image intensifier guidance to prevent cement extravasation.",eng,0.0

The aim of this study was to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns in the affected vertebrae before and after vertebroplasty by determining changes in signal intensity and size and distribution of bone cement within the vertebra at follow-up carried out at 1 week, 6 months and 12 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients were examined using MRI, for a total of 41 treated vertebrae; MRI was performed with a 0.5-Tesla (T) superconductive magnet (SIGNA GE). RESULTS: MRI patterns following vertebroplasty are mainly characterised by the signal produced by the areas surrounding the cement and by the cement itself. There is little effect on the size of the treated vertebra. Acrylic cement appears as an intraspongy focal area of T1 and T2 hypointensity that is mostly oval (34%) or rounded (26.8%); this appearance tends to become stable 6 months after treatment. The area surrounding the cement appears hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, a likely expression of bone marrow oedema; this signal alteration tends to disappear gradually. CONCLUSIONS: In pre- and post-vertebroplasty imaging, MRI is regarded as the reference standard for correct evaluation of both container and content. Awareness of cement changes over time and of the reaction of the surrounding bone tissue is crucial for correct assessment of post-vertebroplasty images.","eng

The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of these procedures for painful vertebral body (VB) fractures in cancer patients. METHODS: The authors reviewed a consecutive group of cancer patients (21 with myeloma and 35 with other primary malignancies) undergoing vertebro- and kyphoplasty at their institution. Ninety-seven (65 vertebro- and 32 kyphoplasty) procedures were performed in 56 patients during 58 treatment sessions. The mean patient age was 62 years (+/- 13 years [standard deviation]) and the median duration of symptoms was 3.2 months. All patients suffered intractable spinal pain secondary to VB fractures. Patients noted marked or complete pain relief after 49 procedures (84%), and no change after five procedures (9%); early postoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores were unavailable in four patients (7%). No patient was worse after treatment. Reductions in VAS pain scores remained significant up to 1 year (p = 0.02, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Analgesic consumption was reduced at 1 month (p = 0.03, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Median follow-up length was 4.5 months (range 1 day-19.7 months). Asymptomatic cement leakage occurred during vertebroplasty at six (9.2%) of 65 levels; no cement extravasation was seen during kyphoplasty. There were no deaths or complications related to the procedures. The mean percentage of restored VB height by kyphoplasty was 42 +/- 21%. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebro- and kyphoplasty provided significant pain relief in a high percentage of patients, and this appeared durable over time. The absence of cement leakage-related complications may reflect the use of 1) high-viscosity cement; 2) kyphoplasty in selected cases; and 3) relatively small volume injection. Precise indications for these techniques are evolving; however, they are safe and feasible in well-selected patients with refractory spinal pain due to myeloma bone disease or metastases.",eng,1.0

INTRODUCTION: The management of patients with vertebral fractures has largely concentrated on the prevention of further fractures by the treatment of underlying osteoporosis, with drug treatment for acute and chronic back pain and the non-pharmacological management of vertebral fractures receiving less attention. DISCUSSION: Emerging evidence suggests that, in addition to reducing the incidence of vertebral fractures, calcitonin, intravenous bisphosphonates and teriparatide may also have a direct effect on bone pain. Targeted analgesia, tailored to individual need is often required in both the acute and chronic phases following vertebral fracture. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have also been approved for use in the management of vertebral fractures and may prove useful in selected patients unresponsive to conventional pain relief. There is some evidence to support the use of individualised tailored exercise programmes aimed at strengthening back muscles to maintain bone density and reduce further fracture incidence. In addition the use of specific orthoses may help to reduce kyphosis, improve mobility and reduce pain. CONCLUSION: Chronic back pain associated with vertebral fracture provides a great challenge to health care professionals and the patient. This demands a combination of options, including not only therapeutic interventions, but also physiotherapy, psychological support and patient education.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To describe a severe vertebroplasty complication, the pulmonary embolism, which proved to be fatal in a patient with many chronic disabilities.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Until 2007, the literature noted that the risk of embolism of polymethylmethacrylate after a percutaneous vertebroplasty counted a small number of pulmonary cement embolism and a smaller number of fatal consequences. The most recent research revealed that the risk of a pulmonary cement embolism ranges from 3.5% to 23% for osteoporotic compression fractures.
METHODS: This study is a case report of an 80-year-old patient with multiple medical comorbid factors, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mild renal failure, osteoporosis, and hepatic cirrhosis. Symptoms of pulmonary embolism developed 1 month after a percutaneous vertebroplasty. An echocardiography report suggested that the cement infiltrated the right atrium and the right pulmonary artery, and this was confirmed by a computed tomographic scan. As the therapy with oxygen and low-molecular-weight heparin failed to solve the thrombus, the patient required a surgical tricuspid annuloplasty and the extirpation of the right atrial and right pulmonary masses.
RESULTS: The course of the operation was complicated by pulmonary infection, and the patient ultimately succumbed to infection/respiratory failure.
CONCLUSION: The presence of intravascular/intracardiac foreign bodies is underreported in literature, but it is quite common in clinical practice. We need to discuss the choice of some non-risk-free interventions such as vertebroplasty in older patients already affected by multiple main disabilities.",English,1.0

Both are reported to be an effective means of pain relief; however, there may be an increased risk of developing subsequent VCFs after such procedures. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and complication profile of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in a single patient series. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A clinical series of 36 patients with VCFs treated by vertebral augmentation procedures was retrospectively analyzed for surgical approach, volume of cement injected, cement extravasation (symptomatic and asymptomatic), the occurrence of subsequent adjacent level fracture, and pain relief. PATIENT SAMPLE: Thirty-six patients with 46 VCFs underwent either kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty after failing conservative therapy. The mean patient age was not significantly different between the kyphoplasty group (70; range, 46-83) and vertebroplasty group (72; range, 38-90) (p=.438). OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were assessed by using self-report measures (a comparative pain rating scale) and physiologic measures (pre- and postoperative radiographs). METHODS: Thirty-six patients with VCFs underwent 46 augmentation procedures (17 patients had 20 fractures treated via kyphoplasty, and 19 patients had 26 fractures treated via vertebroplasty). Seventeen patients in this series underwent kyphoplasty using standard techniques involving bone void creation with balloon tamps, followed by cement injection. Nineteen patients underwent a percutaneous vertebroplasty procedure using a novel cannulated, fenestrated bone tap developed to direct cement anteriorly into the vertebral body to avoid backflow of cement onto neural elements. RESULTS: Pain improvement was seen in >90% of patients in both groups. Mean cement injection per vertebral body was 4.65 mL and 3.78 mL for the kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty groups, respectively (p=.014). Ninety-five percent of the kyphoplasty procedures were performed bilaterally, whereas only 19% of the vertebroplasty procedures required bilateral augmentation (p<.001). There was no cement extravasation resulting in radiculopathy, or myelopathy in either group. Asymptomatic cement extravasation was seen in 5 of 46 (11%) of the total series (3/20 [15%] and 2/26 [7.7%] of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, respectively) (p=.696). Within a 3-month period, there were 5 new adjacent level fractures seen in 3 patients who underwent a kyphoplasty procedure (5/20 [25%]) and none in the vertebroplasty group (p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty appears to offer a comparable rate of postoperative pain relief as kyphoplasty while using less bone cement more often via a unilateral approach and without the attendant risk of adjacent level fracture.",eng,1.0

Intraoperative fluoroscopic images of 198 vertebral levels were reviewed in 137 patients (women, 84; men, 53; mean age, 75.8 +/- 12.5; and those with a diagnosis of osteoporosis, 63%) treated with kyphoplasty between January 01, 2015 and May 31, 2015 at a single center to create a 5-class descriptive system. PMMA spread patterns in the same images were then classified by 2 board-certified radiologists, and a third board-certified radiologist resolved conflicts. A total of 2 primary PMMA spread patterns were identified, namely, acinar and globular, with subtypes of localized acinar, diffuse globular, and mixed, to describe an equal combination of patterns. Interrater reliability using the system was moderate (kappa = 0.47). After resolving conflicts, the most common spread class was globular (n = 63), followed by mixed (n = 58), diffuse globular (n = 30), acinar (n = 27), and localized acinar (n = 20). The spread class after treatment by the 2 most frequent operators differed significantly (n1 = 63, n2 = 70; P < .0001). There was no difference in the spread class between VCF etiologies or vertebral levels. PMMA spread may, therefore, be a modifiable parameter that affects kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty efficacy and adverse events.",eng,0.0

The mean vertebral deformity correction by comparison of the pre- and postoperative Cobb angles was 9.7 degrees. One patient showed cement leakage in the spinal canal without neurological deterioration. The mean postoperative stay was 2.5 days.

However, even in the best treated patients fractures may occur. The most devastating fractures are spine and hip. Traditionally, treating fractures of the spine consisted of bed rest, opioid analgesic medications, and bracing. This resulted in increased risk of side-effects from medication, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, admissions to nursing homes, and death. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty techniques were developed to decrease the detrimental effects of conservative care"" by decreasing or eliminating the pain and stabilizing the fracture. The safety and efficacy of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are similar with several biased opinions in the literature which denotes conflict. Choosing one technique over the other is a physician and/or facility performed preference. There are a small percentage of patients that either vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty does not help. Possibilities could be that not enough cement was used, an adjacent level fracture has occurred, or worsening fracture around the previously treated fracture is causing the pain. For the latter, a repeat vertebral augmentation could be medically necessary. Due to technical constraints, placing an additional kyphoplasty after one has already been accomplished may be technically dangerous and a simpler less costly vertebroplasty technique may be beneficial. This is a case report and review of the literature on the treatment of repeat vertebral augmentation after a previously treated vertebral fracture with kyphoplasty technique. To this date, this is the first article published regarding the use of vertebroplasty technique over a kyphoplasty treated patient.

Symptomatic improvement may require up to 12 months. Treatment includes limited weightbearing and bed rest, oral analgesics, and sacral corsets. Significant mortality and morbidity are associated with pelvic insufficiency fractures. Percutaneous injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) into the fractured ala, sacroplasty, is an alternative treatment for SIF patients. Under fluoroscopic control, 13-G bone trochars are inserted into the fractured ala while the patient is maintained under conscious sedation. Initial reports have documented safe and effective performance of sacroplasty. Yet, these uncontrolled findings do not allow any precision in estimating complication rates or expected outcome. PURPOSE: Assess rates of complications and observe outcomes after sacroplasty in a medium-sized uncontrolled cohort of SIF patients. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A prospective observational cohort study of consecutive osteoporotic SIF patients. PATIENT SAMPLE: Consecutive, osteoporotic patients with symptomatic SIFs electing to enter the study. OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, analgesic utilization, and patient satisfaction. METHODS: Baseline VAS rating, analgesic usage, and duration of symptoms were recorded. Subsequent VAS ratings were assessed within 30 minutes after the procedure, at 2-, 4-, 12-, 24-, and 52-week postprocedure. Analgesic usage and patient satisfaction were assessed at final follow-up. Each procedure was performed under light intravenous conscious sedation using fluoroscopy. Two bone trochars were inserted between the sacral foramen and sacroiliac joint through which 2 to 3 cc of PMMA were injected. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients, 40 females, were treated. The mean age was 75.9 years with a mean symptom duration of 34.5 days. All patients were available at each follow-up interval except one patient who died because of unrelated pulmonary disease before the 4-week follow-up. The mean VAS score at baseline was 8.1 and 3.4 within 30 minutes after the procedure, 2.5 at 2, 2.1 at 4, 1.7 at 12, 1.4 at 24, and 0.8 at 52 weeks. Improvement was statistically significant using a repeated measures single-factor analysis of variance. One case of transient S1 radiculitis occurred but resolved completely with one transforaminal epidural steroid injection. CONCLUSIONS: Sacroplasty for SIF appears to be associated with rapid and sustained pain relief in most patients with few complications. More rigorous trials are warranted to provide definitive evidence of the safety and efficacy of sacroplasty for SIFs.",eng,1.0

Pitzen,2011.0,Balloon kyphoplasty improves back pain but does not result in a permanent realignment of the thoracolumbar spine,10.1055/s-0031-1284415,"INTRODUCTION: Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) has been established as a standard procedure for treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures of the spine in elderly patients, as it results in pain relief for most of the patients. Moreover, BKP may result in a partial realignment of the sagittal shape of the vertebra and the spine. However, it is unclear whether BKP may result in long-term improvement of the sagittal alignment of the spine. The aim of the current study was to investigate if there is a significant loss of correction of the sagittal alignment of the thoracolumbar spine following BKP. METHODS: A prospective, noncontrolled, nonrandomized study, consisting of 71 patients treated for single level osteoporotic compression fracture by BKP at 1 institution and by 1 surgeon, was done. We checked the following radiographic outcome parameters: Beck's ratio, the kyphosis angle of the treated vertebra, the angle of kyphosis including the treated vertebra and the adjacent disc (monosegmental angle), the angle of kyphosis, including the treated segment, the adjacent disc as well as the adjacent vertebra (bisegmental angle). RESULTS: BKP resulted in significant pain relief with a score decreasing from 7.11 to 1.73 on a visual analogue scale immediately after the procedure. The effekt persisted after 1 year with a score of 1.58 VAS points. BKP also led to an improvement of each radiographic outcome parameter immediately after surgery. Beck's ratio was improved from 0.71 to 0.83. The Cobb's angle of the relevant vertebral bodies decreased from 11.4 degrees to 6.8 degrees . Monosegmental and bisegmental kyphosis angles decreased from 8.12 degrees to 4.9 degrees and from 6.9 degrees to 4.5 degrees respectively. Within 1 year, however, there was a significant loss of correction in each radiographic parameter analyzed. Beck's ratio decreased to 0.72, Cobb's angle increased to 10.8 degrees , and the mono- and bisegmental kyphosis angles to 8.8 degrees and 8.3 degrees , respectively.BKP does not result in a permanent realignment of the thoracolumbar spine following treatment of single level osteoporotic compression fractures.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) compared with standard medical treatment (control) in patients with acute/subacute (<3 months) vertebral compression fracture (VCF) due to osteoporosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with a VCF due to osteoporosis are common and will increase in number in an aging population, putting a substantial strain on health care. Selected patients may benefit from stabilizing the fracture with cement through BKP, a minimally invasive procedure. BKP has been reported to give good short-time clinical results, and economic modeling has suggested that the procedure could be cost-effective after 2 years compared with standard treatment. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with back pain due to VCF were randomized to BKP or to control using a computer-generated random list. All costs associated with VCF and cost-effectiveness were reported primarily from the perspective of society. We used EQ-5D to assess quality of life (QoL). The accumulated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs/QALY gained were assessed using intention to treat. RESULTS: Between February 2003 and December 2005, a total of 63 out of 67 Swedish patients were analyzed: BKP (n = 32) and control (n = 31). Societal cost per patient for BKP was SEK 160,017 (SD = 151,083) = euro16,668 (SD = 15,735), and for control SEK 84,816 (SD = 40,954) = euro8835 (SD = 4266), a significant difference of 75,198 (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 16,037-120,104) = euro7833 (95% CI = 1671-12,511). The accumulated difference in QALYs was 0.085 (95% CI = -0.132 to 0.306) in favor of BKP. Cost/QALY gained using BKP was SEK 884,682 = euro92,154 and US $134,043. CONCLUSION: In this randomized controlled trial, it was not possible to demonstrate that BKP was cost-effective compared with standard medical treatment in patients treated for an acute/subacute vertebral fracture due to osteoporosis.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the relationships between these potential influential variables and cement leakage and pain relief at 1 month postoperatively. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted with the pain score reduction and the bone cement leakage as dependent variables and the potential risk factors as independent variables, respectively. The results showed that the independent risk factors for the pain relief were the cement volume injected and fracture age, and for bone cement leakage were the cement volume injected and low-viscosity cement. In conclusion, the present study indicated that there were positive dose-response correlation relationships of cement volume with the incidence of cement leakage and the degree of pain relief after PVP, respectively. Thus, the cement should be injected into the vertebrae as much as possible during the PVP procedure.",eng,1.0

All the patients underwent X-ray examinations after the surgery and according to the position and shape, the cement in the vertebrae were classified into 5 types (I to V), and the volume-cubage index was computed based on the cement volume and vertebral cubage. Age, gender, bone mineral density (BMD), cement distribution index, volume-cubage index, and cement leakage were evaluated in the 2 groups, and the variables with significant differences between the 2 groups were analyzed in Logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: BMD was significantly lower and the rate of cement leakage was significantly higher in the re-fracture group than in the control group (P<0.05). Significant difference was found in cement distribution index between the 2 groups (P<0.05) but not in age, gender, cement volume or volume-cubage index (P>0.05).

The main goal of this technique is to fill the fractured vertebral body with PMMA cement to improve its stability. The efficiency of vertebroplasty on spinal pain related to osteoporotic fractures or the tumorous process has been widely described in the literature. However, the main problem of this percutaneous approach is the risk of cement leakage; to avoid this danger, balloon kyphoplasty was developed. There are two main goals of using balloons: first to reduce the deformity of the fractured vertebral body by inflation and then to fill the cavity created with cement injected without pressure. During the last 8 years kyphoplasty has been used and has shown its efficacy on spinal pain related to osteoporotic fractures, tumorous processes, and myeloma. Reducing the risk of cement leakage was also an opportunity to increase percutaneous technique indications in the treatment of various spinal diseases. These two techniques require appropriate training and are associated with a long learning curve. They must be used in optimal technical conditions, with strict asepsis and a good radioscopic device.

These lesions require decompression surgery with or without spinal stabilization procedures. In this article, we present the preliminary results obtained using open kyphoplasty, a new method of treating vertebral compression disorders. METHODS: Sixteen patients were included in this prospective study, and a total of 17 vertebrae were treated. All of the patients had vertebral compression fractures associated with neurological disorders. The surgical treatment consisted of open kyphoplasty after laminectomy and decompression. Short-segment vertebral osteosynthesis was also performed in patients with pronounced local kyphosis. Pain was rated at clinical assessments, and radiological assessments were performed to determine the restored vertebral height and the correction of any local vertebral kyphosis. RESULTS: Analysis of the results obtained using this method showed that vertebral height was significantly improved (P < 0.001) and local kyphosis was significantly reduced (P < 0.001). The mean operating time was 90 minutes. The neurological status of all patients improved; 14 patients recovered completely from their neurological symptoms. The last 2 patients had associated neurological disease but were able to walk. There were 2 superficial postoperative infections. CONCLUSION: This method for treating severe osteoporotic compression fractures associated with neurological disorders gives successful results and can be used to treat neurological compression fractures while consolidating the vertebral body.

We report in this study the results at 2 years with a percutaneous approach for the treatment of burst fractures. 18 patients were included in this study. All the patients had burst vertebral fractures classified type A3 on the Magerl scale, between levels T9 and L2. The patients' mean age was 53 years (range 22-78 years) and the neurological examination was normal. A percutaneous approach was systematically used and a kyphoplasty was performed via the transpedicular pathway associated with percutaneous short-segment pedicle screw osteosynthesis. The patients' follow-up included CT scan analysis, measurement of vertebral height recovery and local kyphosis, and clinical pain assessments. With this surgical approach, the mean vertebral height was improved by 25% and a mean improvement of 11.28 degrees in the local kyphotic angle was obtained. 3 months after the operation, none of the patients were taking class II analgesics. The mean duration of their hospital stay was 4.5 days (range 3-7 days) and the mean follow-up period was 26 months (range 17-30 months).

Open kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are part of the classic management of this of fracture.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The same procedure was performed in 14 patients during an 18-month period. The average age of the patients was 54 years. All patients suffered severe pain before the surgical procedure (VSA mean: 7). Neurological deficiency was noted in 10 of the 14 patients with this spinal cord compression. Nineteen vertebrae were treated; a short posterior instrumentation was necessary in 11 patients. The average operative time was 90 minutes. Of the patients with neurological deficiency, the clinical status improved after surgery in all. The average VSA of this series 3 days after surgery was 2.

Technical note,10.3171/spi.2007.6.3.284,"OBJECT: Elderly patients in poor general health frequently suffer vertebral body (VB) fractures due to osteoporosis or vertebral metastatic lesions. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty have become the standard treatment for these types of fractures. In certain conditions that cause local kyphosis, such as spinal cord compression due to a metastatic epidural tumor or the shortening of the spinal canal secondary to vertebral compression, the surgical treatment should provide decompression and stabilization during a short intervention. In this study the authors evaluated a surgical technique that frequently combines a same-session surgical decompression, such as a laminectomy, and posterior instrumentation-assisted stabilization during the same open intervention in which the VB is stabilized by kyphoplasty. METHODS: During an 18-month period, the authors treated 18 patients with VB fractures according to this protocol: 14 patients with vertebral metastatic lesions and four with osteoporosis. The patients' mean age was 60 years. All suffered severe pain preoperatively (mean visual analog scale [VAS] score of 7). Fourteen of the 18 patients suffered a neurological deficit. Twenty-three vertebral levels were treated; in 15 patients it was necessary to place posterior instrumentation. The mean duration of the intervention was 90 minutes. Pain in all patients improved 3 days after the intervention, and the mean VAS score decreased to 2. Patients with a neurological dysfunction improved. The mean quantity of injected cement for the kyphoplasty procedure was 7 ml. The mean duration of hospitalization was 7 days. Neuroimaging revealed cement leaks in two cases: one into the disc interspace and one anteriorly into the fractured part of the vertebra. After the intervention, most patients with metastatic lesions underwent radiotherapy. No procedure-related complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: This procedure allows decompression of the spinal cord, consolidation of the VB and thus a stabilization of the vertebral column, and may provide an alternative treatment to invasive VB excision in patients in poor general health.",eng,0.0

To our knowledge, kyphoplasty with polymethylmethacrylate in a patient with type I osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and a vertebral compression fracture has not been reported so far. We report on a 58-year-old patient with type I OI and a vertebral compression fracture at L2 with undislocated posterior vertebral wall and an additional older L1 fracture. Because of severe back pain resistant to conservative therapy over 5 months the indication for percutaneous kyphoplasty was made. Preoperative adjacent endplates of L2 were nearly parallel. Radiologically a minimal loss of height of the L2 vertebra was seen without adjacent fractures at 9 months follow-up. A slight increase of the preoperative kyphotic angle of overlying vertebrae L1 (8.7 degrees/10.3 degrees) and T12 (10.4 degrees/11.0 degrees) was apparent. The visual analogue scale showed decrease of low back pain from 10 to 2 allowing mobilization with a walking frame. Kyphoplasty constitutes a minimal invasive therapeutic alternative in the treatment of vertebral fractures in type I OI and pain, resistant to conservative treatment. Similar to the results of osteoporotic fractures the immediate reduction of pain and stabilization of the fracture in undislocated fragments can be achieved.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the biomechanical characteristics of prophylactic reinforcement and postfracture augmentation of cadaveric vertebrae. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a treatment option for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Short-term results are promising, but longer-term studies have suggested a possible accelerated failure rate in the adjacent vertebral body. Limited research has been conducted into the effects of prophylactic vertebroplasty in osteoporotic vertebrae. This study aims to elucidate the biomechanical differences between the 2 treatment groups. METHODS: Human vertebrae were assigned to 2 scenarios: Scenario 1 simulated a wedge fracture followed by cement augmentation; Scenario 2 involved prophylactic augmentation using vertebroplasty. Micro-CT imaging was performed to assess the bone mineral density, vertebral dimensions, fracture pattern, and cement volume. All augmented specimens were then compressed under an eccentric flexion load to failure. RESULTS: Product of bone mineral density and endplate surface area gave a good prediction of failure strength when compared with actual failure strength of specimens in Scenario 1. Augmented vertebral bodies showed an average cement fill of 23.9% +/- 8.07%. There was a significant postvertebroplasty increase in failure strength by a factor of 1.72 and 1.38 in Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. There was a significant reduction in stiffness following augmentation for Scenario 1 (t = 3.5, P = 0.005). Stiffness of the vertebral body in Scenario 2 was significantly greater than observed in Scenario 1 (t = 4.4, P = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that augmentation of the vertebrae postfracture significantly increases failure load, while stiffness is not restored. Prophylactic augmentation was seen to increase failure strength in comparison to the predicted failure load.

A total of 25 consecutive patients with painful type-A3 amyelic thoracolumbar fractures without neurological deficit were treated by kyphoplasty. Pain was measured using the self-reporting visual analog pain scale (VAS) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 6-month follow-up. Disability was measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 6-month follow-up. The height of the fractured vertebral body, kyphotic angle, and spinal canal compromise were measured preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 6-month follow-up. Relief of pain was achieved 24 hours postoperatively. Mean VAS score decreased from 8.2+/-1.3 preoperatively to 2.8+/-0.8 postoperatively (P<.05), and was maintained at 2.9+/-1.1 at 6-month follow-up. The ODI score varied from 68.2%+/-6.6% preoperatively to 35.3%+/-2.8% postoperatively (P<.05). Improvement was maintained at 6-month follow-up. Postoperatively, the height of anterior vertebrae (Ha) was restored from 61.5%+/-13.9% to 85.3%+/-10.6%, the height of midline vertebrae (Hm) restored from 73.0%+/-19.3% to 83.3%+/-7.4%, the kyphotic angle from 21.7 degrees +/-7.8 degrees to 8.6 degrees +/-6.6 degrees, and the spinal canal compromise from 20.1%+/-4.1% to 17.8%+/-1.3%. At 6-month follow-up, maintenance of the height restoration and kyphotic deformity correction was found. No significant difference was noted in pre- and postoperative spinal canal compromise.

Some articles have been published showing the outcome of vertebroplasty (PV) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), but few comparative studies have been performed. PURPOSE: To compare the effect and safety of PV and BKP in treating osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective comparative study, 38 patients with osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fractures were treated by PV, and 41 patients were treated by BKP from May 2005 to July 2011. The heights of the compromised vertebral body and the kyphotic angles were measured. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to evaluate pain and functional activity, respectively. The occurrence of refracture and cement leakage were determined, and the costs were recorded. RESULTS: The mean VAS and ODI scores significantly improved for both procedures at postsurgical measurements (P < 0.05), and the improvement sustained at the final follow-up. In both groups, there were no significant differences in terms of restoration of the anterior vertebral height and correction of the kyphotic deformity. However, BKP was more effective in restoring the middle vertebral height than PV. Cement leakages were observed in nine (23.7%) treated vertebral bodies in PV group and in three (7.4%) treated vertebral bodies in BKP group, which was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). There were four new osteoporotic vertebral fractures in the PV group and two in the BKP group during the follow-up period. The mean cost in the BKP group (6200 +/- 122.1 USD) was higher than the PV group (2100 +/- 112.5 USD) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both PV and BKP achieved similar improvements in pain and functional outcomes for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fractures. BKP had a significant advantage over PV in terms of the restoration of the middle vertebral height and fewer cement leakages than PV.",eng,0.0

However osteoporotic spinal fractures with middle column compromise are mentioned as a relative contraindication to BKP. Thus we investigated the safety and efficacy of BKP in the treatment of osteoporotic spinal fractures with middle column compromise but without neurological deficit. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 45 patients who suffered osteoporotic fractures with middle column compromise but without neurological deficits were treated by BKP from May 2007 to December 2010. The final follow-ups were finished during the time of July 2011-September 2011. The mean follow-up period was 20.2 months. The height of the compromised vertebral body, the kyphotic angle and spinal canal compromise were measured before surgery, one day after surgery, and at the final follow-up. A visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) were chosen to evaluate pain and functional activity. RESULTS: The mean VAS and ODI scores improved significantly from pre- to post-operation (p<0.05), and this improvement was sustained at the final follow-up. The mean anterior vertebral body height ratio improved from 57.6%+/- 11.8% preoperatively to 86.2%+/- 12.2% postoperatively (p<0.05), so did the mean middle vertebral body height ratio. The kyphotic angle improved from 16.3 degrees +/- 3.7 degrees preoperatively to 9.3 degrees +/- 2.6 degrees postoperatively (p<0.05). At final follow-up, BKP stabilised vertebral height and prevented further kyphotic deformity. While there were no differences in spinal canal compromise between pre-operation and one day after surgery (p>0.05), there was a significant difference from the measurement at the final follow-up (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: BKP is a safe and effective method for osteoporotic spinal fractures with middle column compromise but without neurological deficit.

The trials described a different patient cohort from the one we treat with vertebroplasty. Both enrolled patients had back pain for <or=12 months. This duration of pain was far too long for a vertebroplasty trial, resulting in parallel trials of vertebroplasty on healed fractures. Where a study is needed, it should be comprised of patients with acute osteoporotic compression fractures, particularly those who are hospitalized or bedridden because of the pain of such fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging was not systematically performed before vertebroplasty, and inpatients were excluded. Inpatients with acute fracture pain are the group most likely to respond well to vertebroplasty. Enrolment was a problem in both trials. Randomization in both RCTs took >4 years for completion. We advise that vertebroplasty be offered to patients with recent fractures <8 weeks old who have uncontrolled pain as well as patients progressing to osteonecrosis and the intravertebral vacuum phenomenon (Kummels disease).

METHODS: The clinical data of 65 patients who met the inclusion criteria of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were retrospectively analyzed. According to having intravertebral clefts or not, the patients were divided into 2 groups: cleft group (group A, n=25) and non-cleft group (group B, n=40). There was no significant difference in gender, age, cause of injury, the level of fracture vertebrae, degree of damage, and interval of injury and operation between 2 groups (P > 0.05). All patients were given PVP procedure by unilateral approach. The operation time, the injected volume of bone cement, time to ambulate, complications, and adjacent vertebral re-fracture were recorded. The height of anterior and middle column and the posterior convex Cobb angle of injured spine were measured on the lateral X-ray film in standing position at preoperation and 1, 48 weeks after operation. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score and Oswestry disability index (ODI) system were used to evaluate the pain relief and improvement of daily activity function respectively at preoperation and 1, 4, and 48 weeks after operation. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the operation time and time to ambulate between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The injected volume of bone cement in group B was significantly less than that in group A (t=1.833, P=0.034). Asymptomatic cement leakage occurred in 6 patients (4 in group A and 2 in group B), in group A including 1 case of venous leakage, 2 cases of paravertebral leakage, and 1 case of intradiscal leakage; in group B including 2 cases of venous leakage. No symptomatic pulmonary embolism was observed. The vital sign was stable during operation and postoperatively. All patients were followed up 12-30 months (mean, 18.5 months). No re-fracture of the vertebrae occurred during the follow-up.

Lane,2006.0,Osteoporosis and skeletal fractures,10.1007/s11420-005-0137-8,"Osteoporosis affects millions of individuals worldwide, rendering them susceptible to fragility fractures of the spine, hip, and wrist and leading to significant morbidity, mortality, and economic cost. Given the substantial impact of osteoporosis on both patients and the medical community, it is imperative that physicians improve awareness and knowledge of osteoporosis in the setting of low-energy fractures. In this review, we provide information on effective means of preventing fragility fractures and introduce clinicians to issues pertinent to the patient who suffers an osteoporotic fracture. Prevention of fragility fractures centers around adequate mineral nutrition, including daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation, as well as prescription antiresorptive medications such as bisphosphonates or teriparatide therapy in severe cases, both of which have been shown to decrease future fracture risk. Balance and strength training also play important roles in the management of the osteoporotic patient, particularly following a low-energy fracture, and external hip protectors may be useful for certain patients. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are two minimally invasive techniques that show great promise in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures, although questions regarding long-term biomechanical effects still exist. Traditionally, osteoporosis has been underdiagnosed and undertreated following a low-energy fracture in an elderly patient. Although treatment rates may be improving through public health initiatives, the majority of patients with osteoporosis remain inadequately treated. Perioperative intervention programs that focus on patient education about osteoporosis and treatment options lead to significant increases in intervention and treatment. Reducing the risk of skeletal fractures in patients susceptible to osteoporosis involves improved physician education on the risk factors and management of osteoporosis, as well as informing patients on the significance of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry testing and medical treatment so that they may serve as their own healthcare advocates in this often-undertreated disease.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,S. R. Garfin; M. A. Reilley,2002.0,Minimally invasive treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures,", ","BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Seven hundred thousand osteoporotic compression fractures occur yearly. Approximately 260,000 lead to severe pain, and 150,000 require hospital admissions. Associated with the fractures are increased loss of pulmonary function (90% decreased forced vital capacity per fracture level) and an increase in gastrointestinal complications (early satiety, and therefore malnutrition) and increased mortality (greater than that associated with osteoporotic hip fractures). New treatments available for these painful disorders include kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. The injections of polymethylmethacrylate into the vertebrae (vertebroplasty technique) decrease pain and improve function. Kyphoplasty (percutaneous placement of a balloon tamp to improve height and create a void, and then the filling of this void with cement) improves function, decreases pain and helps realign the spine. PURPOSE: To compare kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, and assess their various merits, treatment indications, and outcomes. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Literature review with presentation of early results of a national, clinical study. METHODS: Literature review for overview. Retrospective chart/patient review for clinical data presented on kyphoplasty. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of individuals treated for painful osteoporotic compression fractures have significant improvement in symptoms and function after kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. Kyphoplasty improves vertebral body height and kyphotic alignment by 50%, if performed within 3 months of the onset of the fracture collapse.

OBJECTIVES: To describe new treatments for painful osteoporotic compression fractures in light of available scientific literature and clinical experience. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Painful vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This relates to pulmonary dysfunction, eating disorders (nutritional deficits), pain, loss of independence, and mental status change (related to pain and medications). Medications to treat osteoporosis (primarily antiresorptive) do not effectively treat the pain or the fracture, and require over 1 year to reduce the degree of osteoporosis. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are new techniques that help decrease the pain and improve function in fractured vertebrae. METHODS: This is a descriptive review of the background leading to vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, a description of the techniques, a review of the literature, as well as current ongoing studies evaluating kyphoplasty. RESULTS: Both techniques have had a very high acceptance and use rate. There is 95% improvement in pain and significant improvement in function following treatment by either of these percutaneous techniques. Kyphoplasty improves height of the fractured vertebra, and improves kyphosis by over 50%, if performed within 3 months from the onset of the fracture (onset of pain). There is some height improvement, though not as marked, along with 95% clinical improvement, if the procedure is performed after 3 months. Complications occur with both and relate to cement leakage in both, and cement emboli with vertebroplasty. CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are safe and effective, and have a useful role in the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures that do not respond to conventional treatments. Kyphoplasty offers the additional advantage of realigning the spinal column and regaining height of the fractured vertebra, which may help decrease the pulmonary, GI, and early morbidity consequences related to these fractures.

Advances in myeloma treatments, yielding improved survival times, have led to an increasing need for effective therapies that improve quality of life. The first randomised trials of vertebroplasty to treat painful osteoporotic crush fractures have cast doubt of its benefit over a placebo procedure, with a proposed rationale that fracture healing over time may account for the non-superiority of the results. However, these findings cannot be extrapolated to myeloma where the pathology is one of progressive bony destruction coupled with failure of new bone formation. In this paper, we present the outcome data for myeloma patients treated at our tertiary referral centre over a 5-year period, focusing on both subjective and objective measures of efficacy and safety. Records were reviewed to extract pain score, function and analgesia pre/post-procedure. Where possible, patients were then contacted directly and asked to assess their benefit by grading change in pain score, analgesia use and mobility. Performance status was assessed using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale. Of the 26 patients treated for painful thoraco-lumbar lesions, 77% reported improved pain score (P < 0.003). Analgesia reduction, better mobility and improved performance status were also seen. Our data support the consideration of vertebroplasty as a first-line treatment for painful myelomatous vertebral disease.

Boriani,2017.0,Elastoplasty as a promising novel technique: Vertebral augmentation with an elastic silicone-based polymer,10.1016/j.aott.2017.01.001,"OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) restores the stiffness and the strength of fractured vertebral bodies, but changes the pattern of the stress transfer. This effect may cause a secondary fracture of the adjacent vertebrae. Elastoplasty has emerged as a new technique to overcome this complication. The aim of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the clinical results of the elastoplasty procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirthy nine patients (9 males, 30 females, 87 spinal levels) were clinically evaluated pre and postoperatively in terms of pain relief, leakage and silicone embolism. The mean age was 67 (range 38-84) years. The mean follow up period was 12,5 months. The patients were evaluated radiologically for the presence of adjacent level fractures postoperatively. Complications were recorded. RESULTS: The mean VAS score decreased from 7,5 to 3,5 during the last follow-up. Symptomatic silicone pulmonary embolism was not encountered in any patients. Leakage was observed in 5 (13%) cases. There was an adjacent level fracture in 1 case and another fracture which was not at the adjacent level in another one. A hematoma occurred in the needle entry site in a patient with trombocytopenia (<70,000). CONCLUSIONS: Elastoplasty is a safe, promising technique in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). Symptomatic silicone pulmonary embolism is not observed. The material's stiffness is close to intact vertebrae. Therefore, elastoplasty may be a good viable option in the treatment of VCFs as it cause less complications and can prevent adjacent level fractures.

This second group presented with back pain and demonstrated tenderness distant from the fracture (n = 5), tenderness lateral to the fracture (n = 4), or no focal tenderness at all (n = 1). All were treated because of edema seen on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and/or increased activity on bone scan. Clinical outcomes were assessed by quantitative measurements of pre- and postoperative levels of pain (11-point scale) and mobility (five-point scale). RESULTS: Pain improvement of three points or greater occurred in 77 of the 85 patients (91%) in group 1 who complied with follow-up and nine of nine such patients (100%) in group 2, with mean postoperative pain levels of 1.82 and 0.33 points, respectively (P =.14). Forty of 45 patients (89%) in group 1 with impaired preoperative mobility reported improvement postoperatively, as did two of three such patients (67%) in group 2. Mean levels of postoperative impaired mobility for groups 1 and 2 were 0.27 and 0.67 points, respectively (P =.27). CONCLUSION: Pain on palpation over the fractured vertebra is not a necessary requirement in selecting patients who will benefit from percutaneous vertebroplasty. Other factors, such as MR evidence of edema or increased uptake on bone scan, should be weighed considerably in the decision to treat a patient.",eng,0.0

Kallmes",2002.0,Relevance of antecedent venography in percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures,", ","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Controversy exists regarding the utility of antecedent venography in percutaneous vertebroplasty. Our purpose was to determine whether antecedent venography improves clinical outcomes and/or decreases extravertebral cement extravasation in these procedures. METHODS: We retrospective reviewed outcomes of consecutive percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures performed at our institution to define two populations, each consisting of 24 patients treated at 42 vertebral levels. Group 1 included patients who underwent antecedent venography, and group 2 included patients treated without venography. Clinical outcomes were assessed with quantitative measurements of pain and mobility. Venograms and postprocedural radiographs were interpreted to evaluate the number of vertebrae with extravertebral cement extravasation, degree of extravasation at each level, and correlation between venography and vertebroplasty. RESULTS: Pain improved in 19 of 20 group 1 patients, compared with 21 of 22 group 2 patients; mean postoperative pain levels were 1.3 and 1.8, respectively (P =.50), on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). All 11 group 1 patients with impaired preoperative mobility reported postoperative improvement, as did all 12 group 2 patients; mean levels of postoperative impaired mobility for groups 1 and 2 were 0.35 and 0.27, respectively (P =.43). Twenty-two of 42 vertebrae treated in group 1 demonstrated extravasation, compared with 28 of 42 in group 2 (P =.266); amounts of extravasation did not differ. Among 22 levels of extravasation in group 1, venograms in 14 showed correlative extravasation. CONCLUSION: Antecedent venography does not significantly improve the effectiveness or safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty performed by qualified, experienced operators.",eng,0.0

Kallmes",2002.0,The therapeutic benefit of repeat percutaneous vertebroplasty at previously treated vertebral levels,", ","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recurrent pain after vertebroplasty is relatively common, usually representing a new fracture at a different vertebral level. In a small cohort described herein, clinical and imaging findings indicated that recurrent pain arose from abnormality of the previously treated level. Our purpose was to demonstrate that repeat percutaneous vertebroplasty performed within the same fractured vertebra can offer therapeutic benefit for patients with recurrent pain after initial treatment. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of consecutive vertebroplasty procedures performed at our institution to define a patient population that underwent repeat vertebroplasty for recurrent pain at previously treated vertebral levels. We identified six such patients over an 8-year period, and clinical outcomes were assessed through quantitative measurements of pre- and postoperative levels of pain and mobility. RESULTS: Initial vertebroplasty resulted in substantial improvement in pain in all six patients. Patients developed recurrent pain between 8 days and 167 days after initial vertebroplasty. After repeat vertebroplasty, five of the six patients reported a reduction of at least 3 points in their rating of pain, with a mean reduction of 6.5 points and a mean postoperative pain level of 3.5 points (11-point scale). Four of six patients reported impaired mobility before repeat vertebroplasty, and all four demonstrated a postoperative improvement in mobility. Mean increase in mobility was 1.50 points, and the mean postoperative mobility impairment was 0.25 points (5-point scale).

We report an unusual case of tuberculous spondylitis diagnosed after percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). A 61-year-old woman presented to our institution complaining of back pain following a fall 7 days before. Radiologic studies revealed an acute osteoporotic compression L1 fracture. The patient denied history of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and there were no signs of infection. The patient was discharged from hospital 4 days after undergoing L1 PKP with a dramatic improvement in her back pain. Two years later, the patient was readmitted with a 1 year history of recurrent back pain. Imaging examinations demonstrated long segmental bony destruction involving L1 vertebra with massive paravertebral abscess formation. The tentative diagnosis of tuberculous spondylitis was made, after a serum T-SPOT. The TB test was found to be positive. Anterior debridement, L1 corpectomy, decompression, and autologous rib graft interposition, and posterior T8-L4 instrumentation were performed. The histologic examination of the resected tissue results confirmed the diagnosis of spinal TB. Anti-TB medications were administered for 12 months and the patient recovered without sequelae. Spinal TB and osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are similar clinically and radiologically. Spinal surgeons should consider this disease entity to avoid misdiagnosis or complications.

Suo,2013.0,Uniextrapedicular kyphoplasty for the treatment of thoracic osteoporotic vertebral fractures,10.3928/01477447-20130724-17,"Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are common and cause pain and disability. Most osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures occur in the lower thoracic and thoracolumbar spine. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty through a transpedicular approach is a classic procedure performed to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. However, due to the slender morphology of the pedicles, small pedicle size, and the angular severity of thoracic kyphosis, performing kyphoplasty in middle and high thoracic levels is technically challenging. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of single-balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of thoracic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures via an extrapedicular approach. Between July 2004 and May 2008, thirty-eight patients with thoracic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty via a unilateral extrapedicular approach. Average patient age was 60.3 years. Symptomatic levels ranged from T4 to T12. All affected vertebrae were identified via physical examination, magnetic resonance imaging, and radiographs. Pain relief, vertebral height restoration, and kyphosis correction were compared pre- and postoperatively using the visual analog scale and radiographs. The operation was successful in all patients. Average injected bone cement volume was 3.2+/-1.4 mL. Mean follow-up was 9.5 months. Visual analog scale pain score improved in 36 of 38 patients postoperatively. Mean visual analog scale pain score was 8.92+/-0.682 preoperatively and 2.40+/-0.31 postoperatively and remained at 2.80+/-0.34 until last follow-up. Mean middle body height correction ratio was 50.9%+/-34.6%. No lateral wedging was found in the coronal alignment of the treated vertebrae. Three (7.9%) patients sustained cement extravasation with no adverse events. Kyphoplasty through a unilateral extrapedicular approach can achieve convergent and proper cement filling in the affected vertebrae to effectively restore stiffness, relieve pain, and correct kyphosis in fractured vertebrae.",eng,0.0

After implantation of an extendable vertebral body replacement (VBR) the two adjacent endplates to the fractured or destroyed vertebra were augmented with bone cement using the anterior approach in 20 patients with short circumferential fusion. All patients were followed up for 2 years clinically and radiographically. X-rays were reviewed for kyphosis, cage subsidence, presence of a solid fusion mass and instrumentation failure. Changes in every day activities (Oswestry Disability Index-ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS), pain score, as well as technique-related complications were examined. The mean amount of kyphosis correction was 12.8 degrees (+/-6.4 degrees ) and changed by only 0.3 degrees (+/-0.4 degrees ) until last follow-up. Pain (VAS) and ODI scores were significantly improved and did not change until last follow-up. In all but two cases, the authors observed solid union with incorporation of the cage. No surgery-related complications were recorded. In one case revision was advised because of non-union due to septic loosening. The augmentation of the adjacent vertebras after anterior VBR provides an enhancement of the interface between cage and vertebra in cases with poor bone quality and in revision surgery.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the numerous treatment options for vertebral compression fractures, a consensus opinion for the management of patients with these factures has not been established. This review is meant to provide an up-to-date overview of the most common treatment strategies for compression fractures and to suggest possible routes for the development of clearer treatment guidelines. METHODS: A comprehensive database search of PubMed was performed. All results from the past 30 years were obtained and evaluated based on title and abstract. The full length of relevant studies was analyzed for level of evidence, and the strongest studies were used in this review. RESULTS: The major treatment strategies for patients with compression fractures are conservative pain management and vertebral augmentation. Despite potential adverse effects, medical management, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcitonin, teriparatide, and bisphosphonates, remains the first-line therapy for patients. Evidence suggests that vertebral augmentation, especially some of the newer procedures, have the potential to dramatically reduce pain and improve quality of life. At this time, balloon-assisted kyphoplasty is the procedure with the most evidence of support. CONCLUSIONS: Based on current literature, it is evident that there is a lack of standard of care for patients with vertebral compression fractures, which is either due to lack of evidence that a procedure is successful or due to serious adverse effects encountered with prolonged treatment. For a consensus to be reached, prospective clinical trials need to be formulated with potential new biomarkers to assess efficacy of treatment strategies.",eng,0.0

In recent preclinical studies, high-viscosity cements were shown to significantly enhance the uniformity of cement filling and decrease the incidence of leakage in cancellous bonelike substrates compared with low-viscosity cements. In this study, the incidence and pattern of cement leakage by using a new high-viscosity cement (Confidence spinal cement system) was compared with that of standard kyphoplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postoperative radiographs of patients treated with either kyphoplasty or Confidence were analyzed for cement leakage by using a stringent and thorough 4-point scale (none, minimal, moderate, or severe). When leakage was observed, the location of the cement leakage was also recorded and described as diskal, venous, paravertebral, or epidural. Sixty-two consecutive patients with 112 treated levels were included in this retrospective review. There were 46 kyphoplasty- versus 66 Confidence-treated levels, which ranged from T3 to L5. RESULTS: The average vertebral collapse reached 27.9 +/- 20.7% in the Confidence group versus 25.0 +/- 19.1% in the kyphoplasty group. There was no or mild leakage in 92% of Confidence and 91% of the kyphoplasty cases (mild, 39% Confidence versus 50% kyphoplasty). Severe leakage was only reported in 1 (2%) Confidence and 1 (2%) kyphoplasty case. In both cases, the severe leakage was found in the disk space. No significant leakage that required any surgical intervention was noticed. CONCLUSIONS: This finding confirms prior observations that highly viscous cements may increase the safety of vertebral augmentation techniques compared with less viscous cements. The high-viscosity Confidence cement results in a leakage rate comparable with that of kyphoplasty.",eng,0.0

Journal Article,B. A. Georgy,2012.0,"Feasibility, safety and cement leakage in vertebroplasty of osteoporotic and malignant compression fractures using ultra-viscous cement and hydraulic delivery system",", ","BACKGROUND: The major complications arising from vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty are related to leakage of cement beyond the confines of the collapsed vertebral body. Traditionally, a liquid (low viscosity) cement is used in most vertebroplasty systems available on the market, coupled with mechanical injection devices or one mL syringes. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety, as well as study cement leakage patterns, in vertebroplasty performed for both osteoporotic and malignant vertebral compression fractures using ultraviscous cement injected by the hydraulic CONFIDENCE Vertebral Augmentation System. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of postoperative images. SETTING: Single center inpatient and outpatient population. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of clinical charts and postoperative X-ray imaging was performed in 122 cases; a total of 214 levels were treated. The study group comprised a total of 163 levels of benign osteoporotic fractures and 51 levels of various malignant lesions. The degree of leakage, seen in postoperative films, was assessed at each treated level using a strict 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe). RESULTS: For benign lesions, there was no leakage in 82 levels (50%), mild venous leakage in 38 levels (23%), moderate venous leakage in 4 levels (2%), mild disc leakage in 28 levels (17%), moderate disc leakage in 7 levels (4%), mild paravertebral leakage in 2 levels (1%), and moderate paravertebral leakage in 2 levels (1%). No severe leakage or epidural leakage were seen. For malignant lesions, there was no leakage in 25 levels (49%), mild venous leakage in 12 levels (24%), moderate venous leakage in 4 levels (8%), mild disc leakage in 7 levels (14%), moderate disc leakage in one level (2%), mild paravertebral leakage in one level (2%), and one level showed a mild epidural leakage (2%). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study, single center. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous cement augmentation in osteoporotic and malignant compression fractures using a highly viscous cement that can be safely controlled and injected via a hydraulic system can be performed safely without significant complications. The leakage rate and patterns were similar in both benign and malignant compression fractures. The use of highly viscous cement may decrease the complication rate in malignant lesions that has been traditionally described to exhibit more cement leakage with low viscosity cement.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,B. A. Georgy,2013.0,Comparison between radiofrequency targeted vertebral augmentation and balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures: addressing factors that affect cement extravasation and distribution,", ","BACKGROUND: Both vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty have been described for treatment of vertebral compression fractures. Vertebroplasty is known for its high leakage rate compared with balloon kyphoplasty. In vitro studies have shown that high-viscosity cements significantly decrease the incidence of cement leakage and increase the predictability of cement fill in cancellous bonelike substrates compared with low-viscosity cements. OBJECTIVE: This study compares the incidence and pattern of cement leakage in cases treated with standard balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) and a novel vertebral augmentation procedure, radiofrequency targeted vertebral augmentation (RF-TVA). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of postoperative radiographs. SETTING: Single center inpatient and outpatient population. METHODS: Two methods of vertebral augmentation were utilized. Conventional bipedicular BKP and RF-TVA, a novel unipedicular technique which uses a navigational osteotome to create targeted, bone sparing cavities and RF energy to deliver an ultra-high viscosity cement at a consistent rate via a remote controlled, automated hydraulic delivery system. Postoperative radiographs of patients treated with the 2 techniques were critically analyzed for the incidence and location of cement leakage. Eighty consecutive patients with 106 treated levels were included. Thirty-five patients with 49 levels in the BKP and 45 patients with 57 levels in RF-TVA group were evaluated. RESULTS: Leakages less than 1-2 mm were not reported since they may not represent any clinical significance. In the BKP group, 6 leakages (12%) were reported (3 discal, 2 venous, one paravaertebral, and no epidural). In the RF-TVA group, a total of 3 leakages (5%) were reported, (one discal, 2 venous, no paravaertebral or epidural). Using contingency analysis for leakage per level, there was a statistical difference for leakage between RF-TVA and standard BKP, P < 0.01. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study, single center. CONCLUSIONS: The RF-TVA technique may provide an approximately 50% reduction in leakage rate when compared to standard BKP. This may be related to the combination of controlled delivery of radiofrequency activated (high viscosity) cement at a fixed, low rate of delivery into site-specific channels created using a navigational osteotome. Additionally, based on the unipedicular access and remotely controlled cement delivery RF-TVA may decrease procedural invasiveness and physician radiation exposure, respectively.INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To compare survivorship after cement augmentation of refractory osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) with traditional inpatient pain management and bracing. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: OVCFs can cause debilitating pain and functional decline necessitating prolonged bed rest and high-dose narcotics. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are cement augmentation procedures used to control pain and restore function in patients with OVCF's that are refractory to conservative treatment. Early mobilization is associated with improved survival after other fractures in elderly patients. METHODS: A university hospital database was used to identify all participants treated with primary diagnosis of OVCF between 1993 and 2006. Chart review and imaging studies were used to confirm demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis, and treatment. Survival time was determined using hospital data, national death indices and patient follow-up. Exact Fisher tests, Mann-Whitney tests, and proportional hazards regression models with Kaplan-Meier plots compared patients treated with cement augmentation with controls treated with inpatient pain management and bracing. Patients with high-energy trauma, tumors or age more than 60 years were excluded. RESULTS: Within the past 12 years, 46 patients treated with cement augmentation and 129 matched controls met inclusion criteria. They did not differ with respect to age, sex, and comorbidities. A significant survival advantage was found after cement augmentation compared with controls (P < 0.001; log rank), regardless of comorbidities, age, or the number of fractures diagnosed at the start date (P = 0.565). Controlling simultaneously for covariates, the estimated hazard ratio associated with cementation was 0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02-0.43; P = 0.002) for year 1, 0.15 (95% CI = 0.02-1.12; P = 0.064) for year 2, and 0.95 (95% CI = 0.32-2.79; P = 0.919) for subsequent follow-up. The number of OVCFs at the start time of treatment did not affect survival benefit of cementation (P = 0.44). CONCLUSION: Cement augmentation of refractory OVCF improves survival for up to 2 years when compared with conservative pain management with bed rest, narcotics, and extension bracing, regardless of age, sex, and number of fractures or comorbidities. Therefore, aggressive management should be considered for refractory OVCFs with intractable back pain.",eng,0.0

Monaco, 3rd",2009.0,"Complete percutaneous treatment of vertebral body tumors causing spinal canal compromise using a transpedicular cavitation, cement augmentation, and radiosurgical technique",10.3171/2009.9.focus09184,"OBJECT: Patients with symptomatic pathological compression fractures require spinal stabilization surgery for mechanical back pain control and radiation therapy for the underlying malignant process. Spinal radiosurgery provides excellent long-term radiographic control for vertebral metastases. Percutaneous cement augmentation using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) may be contraindicated in lesions with spinal canal compromise due to the risk of displacement of tumor resulting in spinal cord or cauda equina injury. However, there is also significant morbidity associated with open corpectomy procedures in patients with metastatic cancer, especially in those who subsequently require adjuvant radiotherapy. This study evaluated a treatment paradigm for malignant vertebral compression fractures consisting of transpedicular coblation corpectomy combined with closed fracture reduction and fixation, followed by spinal radiosurgery. METHODS: Eleven patients (6 men and 5 women, mean age 58 years) with symptomatic vertebral body metastatic tumors associated with moderate spinal canal compromise were included in this study (8 thoracic levels, 3 lumbar levels). Primary histologies included 4 lung, 2 breast, 2 renal, and 1 each of thyroid, bladder, and hepatocellular carcinomas. All patients underwent percutaneous transpedicular coblation corpectomy immediately followed by balloon kyphoplasty through the same 8-gauge cannula under fluoroscopic guidance. Patients subsequently underwent radiosurgery to the affected vertebral body (mean time to treatment 14 days). Postoperatively, patients were assessed for pain reduction and neurological morbidity. RESULTS: There were no complications associated with any part of the procedure. Adequate cement augmentation within the vertebral body was achieved in all cases. The mean radiosurgical tumor dose was 19 Gy covering the entire vertebral body. The procedure provided long-term pain improvement and radiographic tumor control in all patients (follow-up range 7-44 months). No patient later required open surgery. No radiation-induced toxicity or new neurological deficit occurred during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS This treatment paradigm for pathological fractures of percutaneous transpedicular corpectomy combined with cement augmentation followed by radiosurgery was found to be safe and clinically effective. This technique combines minimally invasive procedures that avoid the morbidity associated with open surgery while providing spinal canal decompression and immediate fracture stabilization, and then administering a single-fraction tumoricidal radiation dose.",eng,1.0

Miles,2006.0,Mechanical characterisation of three percutaneous vertebroplasty biomaterials,10.1007/s10856-006-8469-6,"Percutanous vertebroplasty (PVP) is gaining popularity for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. The need of obtaining low viscosity materials for injection through small bore needles and the necessity of visualising the fluid flow during injection have led users to the formulation of a number of ad-hoc recipes aimed at adapting PMMA cements for this use. Industry, on its part, has addressed these requirements by developing specific products for this application. This study aimed at providing a direct comparison of a wide range of mechanical properties between three commercially available biomaterials developed for PVP: two PMMA based materials, Osteopal V (Merck Biomaterial GMBH, Dermstedt, D) and Verterbroplastic (DePuy Acromed, Inc, MA, USA), and a Bis-GMA composite, Cortoss (Orthovita, PA, USA). Cortoss consistently exhibited higher values for compressive strength, bending modulus and shear strength to both Osteopal V and Vertebroplastic. The creep behaviour of Cortoss was also different from that of the two PMMA cements.PVP can take advantage from the development of new injectable biomaterials in response to the problems associated with the use of PMMA in a highly vascularised area such as the vertebral body. In addition careful modulation of the mechanical properties of the material has the potential to further improve the outcome of PVP, possibly reducing the risk of adjacent level fractures associated with the procedure.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in biomechanical stability of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) repaired using an expandable titanium mesh implant, with and without cement, as compared with standard balloon kyphoplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebral augmentation, either in the form of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, is the treatment of choice for some VCFs. Polymethylmethacrylate, a common bone cement used in this procedure, has been shown to possibly cause injury to neural and vascular structures due to extravasation, embolization, and may be too rigid for an osteoporotic spine. Therefore, suitable alternatives for the treatment of VCFs have been sought. METHODS: Individual vertebral bodies from 5 human cadaveric spines (from T4 to L5) were stripped of all soft tissues, and compressed at 25% of the intact height using methods previously described. Vertebral bodies were then randomly assigned to the following repair techniques: (1) conventional kyphoplasty, (2) titanium implant with cement, (3) titanium implant without cement. All vertebral bodies were then recompressed at 25% of the repaired height. Yield load, ultimate load, and stiffness were recorded and compared in these groups before and after treatment. RESULTS: There were no differences in biomechanical data between intact groups, and between repaired groups. In all 3 treatment groups, yield load and ultimate load of repaired vertebrae were similar to that of intact vertebrae. However, the stiffness following repair was found to be statistically less than the stiffness of the intact vertebral body (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: Based on the biomechanical data, the titanium mesh implant with or without cement was similar to polymethylmethacrylate fixation by kyphoplasty in the treatment of VCFs. Avoiding the adverse effects caused by using cement may be the main advantage of the titanium mesh implant and warrants further study.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study performed through examination of patient records, baseline questionnaires, demographic sheets, follow-up questionnaires, reports from telephone follow-up, and pain location diagrams completed before and after percutaneous vertebroplasty. Data were gathered from 350 patient encounters, 686 vertebroplasty procedures, and 288 patients. After determining the prevalence of nonmidline pain, analysis of acquired data was performed to determine the efficacy of vertebroplasty in relieving nonmidline pain. RESULTS: Nonmidline pain was present in 240 of 350 patient encounters. Major symptom areas were the ribs; hip, groin, and buttocks; and legs and thighs. Lesser areas of nonmidline symptoms were the abdomen, shoulders, and waistline. Overall there was improvement in nonmidline pain in 83% of the procedures. CONCLUSION: Most patients presenting for percutaneous vertebroplasty have nonmidline pain. Vertebroplasty reduced or eliminated nonmidline pain in 76-92% of the patients in whom it was reported. Procedures involving lumbar vertebrae tended to be successful less often than others, but even in these patients the procedure was successful in approximately 75%.",eng,0.0

The histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of MM and the postoperative radiological investigation showed a good vertebral body (VB) restoration. No gross neurological deficit was noted and the patient was discharged within a few days after a good recovery. Kyphoplasty is a percutaneous technique utilized by means of a posterior approach for VB restoration from T4 to the fifth lumbar vertebra (L5) in patients with vertebral body compression fractures (VCFs) of osteoporotic, traumatic and neoplastic origin. Anatomic obstacles make the performance of posterior kyphoplasty from T1 to T4 very difficult. To the best of our knowledge no anterior approach for T1 kyphoplasty has been reported in the literature. Our experience gives us the opportunity to emphasize this approach and this technique for the minimally invasive treatment of the VCFs of this segment of the spine.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,"J. B. Gill; M. Kuper; P. C. Chin; Y. Zhang; R. Schutt, Jr.",2007.0,Comparing pain reduction following kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures,", ","BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis with subsequent osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures is an increasingly important disease due not only to its significant economic impact but also to the increasing age of our population. Pain reduction and stabilization are of primary importance with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Although many patients heal with conservative treatment consisting of rest or activity modification, analgesics, and bracing, the management of severe pain compels some patients to seek surgical intervention via 2 procedures: vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Although there is abundant support in the literature for both procedures, there remains debate over which procedure can most successfully reduce patients' perception of pain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the amount of pain reduction using the visual analog scale (VAS) with kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. DESIGN: Meta-analysis METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature was performed to quantify the amount of pain reduction using the visual analog scale (VAS) between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies, 14 vertebroplasty and 7 kyphoplasty, qualified for inclusion representing totals of 1,046 vertebroplasty and 263 kyphoplasty patients treated, respectively. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty resulted in a more than 5 point drop in the VAS in the immediate postoperative period (p<0.00001). Between the two, the difference in early pain relief was not significant. At final follow-up, the long-term VAS was improved for both procedures, but the final follow-up VAS for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty was not significant when compared to the initial postoperative VAS (p=0.25, p=0.38, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The analysis demonstrates that both procedures reduce the amount of pain in the immediate postoperative period by approximately 50%. Both procedures reduce pain in symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures that have failed conservative treatment. Randomized controlled trials are needed to provide definitive data on which procedure is the most effective for vertebral compression fractures.",eng,0.0

Persenaire,2013.0,Subsequent fractures post-vertebral augmentation: analysis of a prospective randomized trial in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures,10.3174/ajnr.A3156,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Two injectable materials for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures, Cortoss and PMMA, were compared in a prospective, randomized study. Our purpose was to analyze the incidence and nature of subsequent fractures following treatment, one of the secondary outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted at 21 US sites by 38 investigators by using Cortoss randomized 2:1 to PMMA in 256 patients blinded to treatment assignment. Inclusion criteria were 1-2 osteoporotic fractures causing significant pain or worsening vertebral collapse on radiographs and visual analog scale pain measuring >/=50 mm. Assessments were conducted pretreatment, on treatment day, and at 7 posttreatment intervals. Imaging studies underwent independent blinded review. Internal and independent monitors, including the FDA, verified data. RESULTS: Of the 256 patients, 45/162 Cortoss-treated (27.8%) and 30/94 PMMA-treated (31.9%) patients experienced new fractures, most within 30-365 days. In patients with 1 acute or subacute fracture and no previous fractures, subsequent fracture incidence was less in patients treated with Cortoss (17.6%) than with PMMA (27.3%). In this subgroup, adjacent fractures occurred in 10.3% of patients treated with Cortoss and 18.2%, with PMMA, a 43.4% lower incidence in the Cortoss group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with PMMA, Cortoss use resulted in fewer subsequent fractures, especially in patients with first fractures. In patients without previous fractures, the subsequent fracture rate was also lower in Cortoss-treated versus conservatively treated patients in other studies. This reduced subsequent fracture rate may be due to differences in the material and mechanical properties of Cortoss compared with PMMA. As finite-element analysis modeling demonstrated, Cortoss restores a more physiologic load transfer through the treated vertebra. Patients treated with Cortoss were less likely to be hospitalized for new fractures.",eng,1.0

The recent introduction of calcium phosphate cement (CPC) that offers, at least theoretically, an osteointegrative capacity, absent in polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), has generated interest for its use in the treatment of traumatic fractures (type A) even in young patients. METHODS: In this study, type A fractures without neurological signs were treated. A total of six male patients, of age between 21 and 55 years (mean age 38 years), were included. Fracture treatment was performed with kyphoplasty with balloon (Kyphon) and injection of calcium phosphate cement for a total of seven procedures. RESULTS: The results were evaluated according to the regional kyphosis angle and the local kyphosis angle. The postoperative X-ray control showed an average improvement of the regional kyphosis angle of 7.4 degrees ; however, this value was reduced by an average of 6.6 degrees after 45 days with regard to the postoperative control. The local kyphosis angle showed an average improvement of 9 degrees at the postoperative control with an average worsening of 9.2 degrees in the control after 45 days.

This technique--with or without metallic implants--might have more widespread indications, if the mechanics of the injection and distribution of the cement dough through cannulated instruments and implants were better understood. This study was performed to investigate injectability of calcium phosphate and acrylic bone cements through implant prototypes, which featured different perforated sleeve designs. Using a custom-made capillary rheometer, the forces needed to inject 10 mL of the cement dough through standard cannulas were measured in the first series of experiments. In the second series, plastic sleeves were attached to the rheometer, simulating the implant. In both series, the dough was injected into ambient laboratory atmosphere, and in the second series, cement distribution was analyzed by means of an optical system. Injection of cement dough through the cannulas required forces between 50 and 400 N in the case of acrylic cements and between 40 and 500 N in case of the calcium phosphate cements. Using different sleeves did not have a significant influence on the distribution of the cement dough around the sleeve. The amount of cement dough injected was reduced when a perforated implant was attached to the cannula. More material was delivered through the proximal holes of the implant, leading to a V-shaped distribution of the cement dough. Among topics to be investigated in future studies is determination of the injectability of cement dough into trabecular bone or bone-like structures.",eng,0.0

It is one of the most common diseases affecting both men and women. The key to treatment is early prevention accompanied by modification of risk factors and impact-oriented exercise, optimal medical management with antiresorptive medications, and addressing the complications of this disease such as compression fractures and spinal deformities. Most osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures can be treated nonsurgically, but new techniques such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are producing good early clinical results with low complication profiles. The surgical treatment of deformities such as kyphosis and scoliosis can be very challenging given the poor bone quality and propensity for instrumentation cutout. The surgical treatment of spinal stenosis in the face of deformity in these patients requires keen surgical planning and a clear identification of the source of the patient's complaints--be it the deformity, the stenosis, or both.

Liaw,2002.0,Advances in surgical treatment of osteoporotic fractures of the spine,", ","INTRODUCTION: To highlight recent advances in the management of osteoporotic compression fractures of the spine. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was conducted from January 1975 to October 2001. Keywords included osteoporotic compression fractures, osteoporosis and spine fractures. RESULTS: Osteoporotic fractures of the spine often cause significant morbidity to the elderly individual. Diagnosis requires a detailed history and physical examination and investigations are usually required to exclude other causes of back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often helpful in excluding other causes of pathologic fracture but may not be confirmatory. Conservative treatment was the traditional approach, but newer percutaneous treatments, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, are safe and simple day surgery procedures which allow for rapid recovery of symptoms and prevention of increasing spinal deformity. Neurological deficit as a result of spinal canal compromise from retropulsed fragments, though relatively uncommon, is well recognised as a cause of significant morbidity and is a major indication for open spinal surgery. Various spinal approaches including anterior or posterior decompression combined with a variety of stabilisation techniques have been reported in the literature. Rehabilitation is often required to improve physical function. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporotic fractures of the spine are a common cause of morbidity in the elderly. Patients who have persistent pain despite conservative treatment require investigation to exclude other pathological causes of fracture. Percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are new techniques that offer much promise in the treatment of these elderly patients. Open surgery may still be required where there is significant neurologic compromise.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: Was an exploratory data analysis for candidate cytokine biomarkers present in the fracture milieu of patients with persistent back pain associated with vertebral compression fracture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lumbar and thoracic compression fractures are common. Little is known about the presence of inflammatory mediators within fractured vertebra in the clinical setting. METHODS: Thirty patients diagnosed with a single thoracic or lumbar compression fracture were treated with single level vertebroplasty. At the time of intervention, needle aspiration was carried out at the fractured level. A multiplexed bead assay was used to assess the presence of 27 different cytokines and inflammatory mediators. A control group consisted of needle aspiration samples of 30 lumbar vertebra from 13 patients with chronic pain but no fracture undergoing open instrumented fusion. RESULTS: Thirty patients with 30 fractures consisted of 23 female and 7 male with a mean age of 77.5 years (SD 13.6; range 42 to 97) and a mean of 3.9 weeks of pain (SD 3.1; range 1 to 12). The highest levels of inflammatory mediators were (in order): IL-1 receptor antagonist, PDGF, RANTES, IP-10, IL-8, and eotaxin. These mediators were present at concentrations>200 pg/mL. Compared with controls with chronic pain, significant differences were present for 4 mediators: TNF, MIP-1b, IL-9, and IL-12.

Recommendations depend on type of fracture, grade of instability, bone quality, and general conditions of the patient. Spontaneous fractures may be considered to be treated different compared to cases with high-velocity trauma.
METHODS: According to the DVO, patients without trauma should first be treated conservatively. However, there is no more strict time protocol of 3 or 6 week conservative treatment before operations may be indicated. Surgical criteria are not yet distinctly defined. For highly unstable fractures (type B and C according to the AO Spine Classification), posterior instrumentation with cement augmented screws and as long construct, respectively, is adequate. Current literature has been analysed for diagnostic and therapeutic protocols.

Buhren,2017.0,Percutaneous vertebral augmentation in fragility fractures-indications and limitations,10.1007/s00068-016-0753-7,"INTRODUCTION: There is still no general consensus about the management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Recommendations depend on type of fracture, grade of instability, bone quality, and general conditions of the patient. Spontaneous fractures may be considered to be treated different compared to cases with high-velocity trauma. METHODS: According to the DVO, patients without trauma should first be treated conservatively. However, there is no more strict time protocol of 3 or 6 week conservative treatment before operations may be indicated. Surgical criteria are not yet distinctly defined. For highly unstable fractures (type B and C according to the AO Spine Classification), posterior instrumentation with cement augmented screws and as long construct, respectively, is adequate. Current literature has been analysed for diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. RESULTS: There is no clear operative concept for burst fractures and classic osteoporotic fractures with dynamic ongoing sintering. Percutaneous vertebral augmentation showed to prevent the fractures from ongoing kyphotic deformity and the patients from painful immobilization.

Journal Article,S. G. Gonzalez; M. D. Vlad; J. L. Lopez; E. F. Aguado,2014.0,Advantageous new conic cannula for spine cement injection,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/BRS.0000000000000459,"STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study to characterize the influence of the cannula geometry on both, the pressure drop and the cement flow velocity established along the cannula.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the new experimental geometry of cannulas can affect the extravertebral injection pressure and the velocity profiles established along the cannula during the injection process.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty procedure is being used to treat vertebral compression fractures. Vertebra infiltration is favored by the use of suitable: (1) syringes or injector devices; (2) polymer or ceramic bone cements; and (3) cannulas. However, the clinical use of ceramic bone cement has been limited due to press-filtering problems. Thus, new approaches concerning the cannula geometry are needed to minimize the press-filtering of calcium phosphate-based bone cements and thereby broaden its possible applications.
METHODS: Straight, conic, and combined conic-straight new cannulas with different proximal and distal both length and diameter ratios were drawn with computer-assisted design software. The new geometries were theoretically analyzed by: (1) Hagen-Poisseuille law; and (2) computational fluid dynamics. Some experimental models were manufactured and tested for extrusion in order to confirm and further advance the theoretical results.
RESULTS: The results confirm that the totally conic cannula model, having proximal to distal diameter ratio equal 2, requires the lowest injection pressure. Furthermore, its velocity profile showed no discontinuity at all along the cannula length, compared with other known combined proximal and distal straight cannulas, where discontinuity was produced at the proximal-distal transition zone.
CONCLUSION: The conclusion is that the conic cannulas: (a) further reduced the extravertebral pressure during the injection process; (b) showed optimum fluid flow velocity profiles to minimize filter-pressing problems, especially when ceramic cements are used; and (c) can be easily manufactured. In this sense, the new conic cannulas should favor the use of calcium phosphate bone cements in the spine.

Kabir,2014.0,PMMA-augmentation of incompletely cannulated pedicle screws: a cadaver study to determine the benefits in the osteoporotic spine,10.3233/thc-140815,"BACKGROUND: Pedicle screw pullout due to poor bone quality, mainly caused by osteoporosis, is a common problem in spine surgery. Special implants and techniques, especially PMMA augmentation, were developed to improve the fixation of pedicle screws. PMMA injection into a pilot hole or through a screw involves the same risks as vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, regardless of the technique used. Especially when using fully cannulated screws anterior leakage is possible. OBJECTIVE: To prove PMMA injection is safe and possible without leakage through an incompletely cannulated screw and also increases pullout forces in the osteoporotic vertebra. METHODS: Incompletely cannulated pedicle screws were tested by axial pullout in human cadavers, divided into osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic groups. Non-augmented and PMMA-augmented pedicle screws were compared. Twenty-five human vertebrae were measured by DEXA and divided into osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic groups. In each vertebra both pedicles were instrumented with the new screw (WSI-Expertise 6x45 mm, Peter Brehm Inc. Germany); the right screw was augmented with a 3 mL PMMA injection through the screw. On each screw axial pullout was performed after X-ray and CT scan. RESULTS: Radiographs and CT scans excluded PMMA leakage. Cement was distributed in the middle and posterior third of the vertebrae. Pullout forces were significantly higher after pedicle screw augmentation, especially in the osteoporotic bone. All augmented pedicle screws showed higher pullout forces compared with the unaugmented screws. CONCLUSIONS: We minimized the risk of leakage by using a screw with a closed tip. On the whole, PMMA augmentation through an incompletely cannulated pedicle screw is safe and increases pullout forces in osteoporotic bone to the level of healthy bone. Therefore the new incompletely cannulated screw can be used for pedicle screw augmentation.",eng,1.0

Although most vertebral compression fractures heal within a few months with conservative therapy, a significant portion fail to improve with conservative treatment and require long-term care, conservative treatment, or both. Fractures that fail conservative therapy are treated with vertebral augmentation procedures (VAPs) such as vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP). Two large randomized clinical trials published in 2009 questioned the efficacy of VP in treatment of VAPs. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate trends in utilization of VP and KP between 2005 and 2010 to capture the impact of the 2009 literature on utilization of VAPs. The study also compares patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes between VP and KP to further delineate the risks of each procedure. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of national utilization rates, clinical outcomes, patient demographics, and patient comorbidities using a large national inpatient database. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 63,459 inpatient admissions from 46 states and more than 1,000 different hospitals were included in the analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of stay (LOS), total direct cost, mortality, postoperative complications. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample database for the period between 2005 and 2010. National Inpatient Sample is the largest publicly available all payer inpatient database in the United States. Patients undergoing VP and KP were identified via corresponding the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision procedure codes. National utilization trends were estimated using weights supplied as part of the National Inpatient Sample dataset. Information on patient comorbidities and demographics was collected. A series of univariate and multivarariate analyses were used to identify statistically significant differences in patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, as well as cost and LOS between patients undergoing VP versus KP. RESULTS: A total of 307,050 inpatient VAPs were performed in the United States between 2005 and 2010. Of those procedures, 225,259 were KP and 81,790 were VP. Kyphoplasty utilization showed an increasing trend between 2005 and 2007, increasing from 27 to 33 procedures per 100,000 capita older than 40 years. During the same time period, VP utilization remained constant at approximately nine procedures per 100,000 capita older than 40 years. After 2007, utilization of both VP and KP decreased. The most precipitous decrease in VAP utilization occurred in 2009. Patients undergoing VP were on average older (76.7 vs. 77.8, p<.0001), more frequently women (74.48% vs. 73.15%, p=.00083), and black (1.77% vs. 1.55%, p=.004059). Patients undergoing VP had on average more comorbidities then those undergoing KP. Patients undergoing VP had a higher rate of postoperative anemia secondary to acute bleeding and higher rate of venous thromboembolic events. Those undergoing KP had a greater rate of cardiac complications; however, this difference was not statistically significant when taking into account patient age and comorbidity burden. Vertebroplasty was associated with higher mortality (0.93% vs. 0.60%, p<.001), longer LOS (6.78 vs. 5.05 days, p<.0001), and lower total cost ($42,154 vs. $46,101, p<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, KP was associated with lower complication rates, shorter LOS, and a higher total direct cost compared with VP. Utilization rates showed a significant decrease since 2009 in both VP and KP, suggesting that both procedures were impacted by the two randomized controlled trials published in 2009 that suggested poor efficacy of VP.",eng,1.0

Qureshi,2011.0,Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty: trends in use in ambulatory and inpatient settings,10.1016/j.spinee.2011.07.002,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are a substantial health concern. Kyphoplasty (KP) and vertebroplasty (VP) are vertebral augmentation procedures (VAPs) used to treat VCFs. PURPOSE: To compare VP and KP patient demographics and evaluate inpatient and outpatient utilization trends. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patient demographics, and inpatient and outpatient utilization trends, from California, New York, and Florida inpatient and ambulatory discharge databases. METHODS: Hospitalizations for VP and KP were identified from California, New York, and Florida inpatient and ambulatory discharge databases from 2005 to 2008. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes for pathologic, dorsal, and lumbar fracture of vertebrae were cross-referenced with ICD-9 procedure codes and Current Procedural Terminology codes to select the population. Patients younger than 40 years or those who underwent both procedures were excluded. RESULTS: The final population contained 61,851 VAPs (35,805 KPs and 26,046 VPs). Kyphoplasty showed increased inpatient and outpatient utilization. Vertebroplasty utilization remained at a low level of 6/100,000 capita. Kyphoplasty patients had more comorbidities than VP patients. In Florida in 2008, radiologists performed most VPs (52.3%) and orthopedists performed the most KPs (35.45%). Postoperative complication rates were significantly different; 0.79% of KPs had cardiac complications versus 0.57% of VPs (p=.0073). Respiratory complications occurred in 0.83% of KPs and 0.49% of VPs (p<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral augmentation procedures have seen a continued increase in use from 2004 to 2008. Use of KP significantly outpaces the use of VP. Reasons for the increasing utilization of KP likely include financial incentives, the specialty performing KP, perceived safety, and effectiveness of vertebral height restoration. Conflicting evidence regarding which procedure is safer warrants further evaluation.",eng,1.0

METHODS: A retrospective, open study of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) was conducted with long-term follow-up. PV with PMMA was carried out between 1990 and 1996 in 40 patients with symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fracture(s) that had not responded to maximum medical therapy. In 1997, each patient was asked to come back to our institution for a physical and spinal X-ray examination. Efficacy was assessed by changes over time in pain on Huskisson's visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Thirty-four vertebrae treated by PV in 25 patients were evaluated with long-term follow-up. The mean duration of follow-up was 48 months (range 12-84 months). Pain assessed by the VAS significantly (P<0.05) decreased from a mean of 80 mm+/-16 (S.D.) before PV to 37+/-24 mm after 1 month and 34+/-28 mm at the time of maximal follow-up. There was no severe complication related to this treatment, and no progression of vertebral deformity in any of the injected vertebrae. However, there was a slight but significantly increased risk of vertebral fracture in the vicinity of a cemented vertebra (odds ratio 2.27, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.56). The odds ratio of a vertebral fracture in the vicinity of an uncemented fractured vertebra was 1.44 (0.82-2.55). CONCLUSION: PV appears to be a safe and useful procedure for the treatment of focal back pain secondary to osteoporotic vertebral fracture when conservative treatment has failed.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and morphologic outcomes as well as follow-up fractures after kyphoplasty of painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures with calcium-phosphate (CaP) cement (group 1) and with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-cement (group 2). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CaP cements seem to be an alternative material for usage in kyphoplasty of vertebral fractures. CaP cements are biodegradable and replaceable by newly formed bone after implantation. Concerns have been raised with regard to the stability of resorbable CaP-cements after implantation into vertebrae post kyphoplasty. Calcibon is a possible CaP cement, which exhibited adequate stability in short-term observations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Kyphoplasty was performed in 40 consecutive patients with primary osteoporosis and painful vertebral fractures, 20 received CaP-cement, 20 were treated with PMMA-cement. All patients received a pharmacological antiosteoporosis treatment (1000 mg calcium, 1000 IU vitamin D3, and oral aminobisphosphonate), pain medication, and physiotherapy. Pain (visual analog scale [VAS]; range, 0-100), mobility (EVOS-score; range, 0-100) and radiomorphologic measurements were assessed at baseline and after 6, 12, and 36 months. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the CaP and PMMA-cement group regarding VAS-scores, EVOS-scores, or height-restoration at any time point. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of vertebral follow-up fractures between both groups during the 3-year follow-up period. CONCLUSION: CaP cement, e.g., Calcibon, is as effective and safe as conventional PMMA-cement with regard to immediate and sustained pain reduction and improvement of mobility after kyphoplasty of patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. CaP cement has the potential of being resorbed and replaced by newly formed bone tissue; thus, it seems to be a promising alternative for PMMA also in younger patients with painful vertebral fractures.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,J. Graham; C. Ahn; N. Hai; B. D. Buch,2007.0,Effect of bone density on vertebral strength and stiffness after percutaneous vertebroplasty,10.1097/BRS.0b013e318133fc73,"STUDY DESIGN: An ex vivo biomechanical study using cadaveric vertebral bodies. OBJECTIVE: To determine how bone mineral density (BMD) affects mechanical strength and stiffness of the vertebral body after vertebroplasty, and to determine how the association between mechanical properties and BMD varies with amount of cement injected. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Adverse events associated with vertebroplasty include cement leakage and adjacent fractures. Understanding effects of bone density and cement volume on mechanical properties may be important clinically to identify the minimum cement volume that will benefit the patient while minimizing risks of adverse events. METHODS: The bone mineral density of 13 vertebral columns from adult white female cadavers was measured with DEXA. Vertebral bodies (n = 126) were assigned to 5 groups based on cement treatment: intact, untreated, 4% fill, 12% fill, and 24% fill. Treated specimens were first loaded asymmetrically to simulate a wedge compression fracture before injection with polymethylmethacrylate cement. Strength and stiffness were measured in axial compression. RESULTS: Only the highest cement dose used (24% fill, 7 mL on average) had an effect on mechanical stiffness or strength. Within this group, stiffness was improved relative to untreated fractures but not restored to prefracture levels, and strength was enhanced beyond intact values. These improvements in stiffness and strength depended significantly on bone density, with highly osteoporotic samples benefitting the least. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that highly osteoporotic patients may receive the least amount of improvement in mechanical properties after vertebroplasty. It is recommended, therefore, that cement volume be restricted to the amount needed for fracture reduction only because there may be a limit to the mechanical benefits that additional cement can offer, depending on patient bone density. Understanding these limitations can potentially minimize risks of adverse events.",eng,1.0

Kallmes,2007.0,INvestigational Vertebroplasty Efficacy and Safety Trial (INVEST): a randomized controlled trial of percutaneous vertebroplasty,10.1186/1471-2474-8-126,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures has historically been limited to several weeks of bed rest, anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications, calcitonin injections, or external bracing. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (the injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebral body) is a relatively new procedure used to treat these fractures. There is increasing interest to examine the efficacy and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty and to study the possibility of a placebo effect or whether the pain relief is from local anesthetics placed directly on the bone during the vertebroplasty procedure. METHODS/DESIGNS: Our goal is to test the hypothesis that patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures who undergo vertebroplasty have less disability and pain at 1 month than patients who undergo a control intervention. The control intervention is placement of local anesthesia near the fracture, without placement of cement. One hundred sixty-six patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures will be recruited over 5 years from US and foreign sites performing the vertebroplasty procedure. We will exclude patients with malignant tumor deposit (multiple myeloma), tumor mass or tumor extension into the epidural space at the level of the fracture. We will randomly assign participants to receive either vertebroplasty or the control intervention. Subjects will complete a battery of validated, standardized measures of pain, functional disability, and health related quality of life at baseline and at post-randomization time points (days 1, 2, 3, and 14, and months 1, 3, 6, and 12). Both subjects and research interviewers performing the follow-up assessments will be blinded to the randomization assignment. Subjects will have a clinic visit at months 1 and 12. Spine X-rays will be obtained at the end of the study (month 12) to determine subsequent fracture rates. Our co-primary outcomes are the modified Roland score and pain numerical rating scale at 1 month. DISCUSSION: Although extensively utilized throughout North America for palliation of pain, vertebroplasty still has not undergone rigorous study. The study outlined above represents the first randomized, controlled study that can account for a placebo effect in the setting of vertebroplasty.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the number of vertebral levels treated during percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures or the number of separate vertebroplasty procedures performed on a given patient affect clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We defined 3 patient populations in our retrospective study. Group 1 included 328 patients who underwent 1 single-level vertebroplasty procedure. Group 2 included 226 patients who underwent a single procedure in which 2 or more vertebral levels were treated. Group 3 included 101 patients who underwent 2 or more separate vertebroplasty procedures. Follow-up was performed between 1 week and 2 years postoperatively. Clinical outcomes were assessed through analysis of quantitative measurements of pre- and postoperative levels of pain with and without activity (0-10) as well as mobility improvement. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used to evaluate the differences among groups. Univariate and chi(2) analyses were performed to show the proportion of underlying diseases in each group.

Methods and preinterventional diagnostics],", ",PURPOSE: Minimal invasive stabilizations represent a new alternative for the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures. Vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty are two methods to enhance the strength of osteoporotic vertebral bodies by the means of cement application. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Vertebroplasty is the older and technically easier method. The balloon kyphoplasty is the newer and more expensive method which does not only improve pain but also restores the sagittal profile of the spine. RESULTS: By balloon kyphoplasty the height of 101 fractured vertebral bodies could be increased up to 90% and the wedge decreased from 12 to 7 degrees. Pain was reduced from 7.2 to 2.5 points. The Oswestry disability index decreased from 60 to 26 points. This effect persisted over a period of two years. Cement leakage occurred in only 2% of vertebral bodies.

Because of the lack of comparative studies, we performed an investigation to describe the mechanical effects and the impact on life quality during a follow-up period of 2 years. METHODS: Patients with nonrecent fractures of vertebral bodies, ongoing bone remodeling, and major kyphotic deformity were treated with minimal invasive stabilization. The median duration of pain was 8 weeks before surgery. Because of the availability of the equipment, 28 patients were nonrandomly assigned to balloon kyphoplasty and 23 patients to vertebroplasty. The follow-up was performed 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: The kyphotic wedge of the vertebral bodies was decreased 6 degrees by balloon kyphoplasty but not by vertebroplasty. With both methods, we found a rapid decrease of pain down to one-half of the preoperative value. A long-lasting effect on pain was found only after balloon kyphoplasty. In the kyphoplasty group, a decrease of the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score was found during the first postoperative year. After 2 years, the ODI was not different from preoperative values in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In nonrecent fractures, the reduction of the kyphotic wedge by balloon kyphoplasty was superior in decreasing pain persisting over a period of 2 years. The ability to improve disability after kyphoplasty was limited to 1 year. In nonrecent fractures, the consequences of age and osteoporosis seem to equalize the effects of the restored sagittal profile on disability but not on pain.",eng,1.0

The spines were then tested in three conditions: 1) intact, 2) after LS (T11-L3), 3) SS (T12-L2) instrumentation with pedicle screws and rods, and 4) short segment instrumentation plus cement augmentation of the fracture level (SSC). LS instrumentation was found to significantly reduce the motion at the instrumented level (T12-L2) as well as the levels immediately adjacent in flexion, extension and lateral bending. Similarly, SSC augmentation was found to significantly reduce the motion compared to intact at T12-L2 but still maintained the adjacent level motion. However, SS instrumentation alone did not significantly reduce the motion at T12-L2 except for left lateral bending.

Briem,2009.0,Sacroplasty in a cadaveric trial: comparison of CT and fluoroscopic guidance with and without balloon assistance,10.1007/s00586-009-1001-1,"Sacral insufficiency fractures can cause severe, debilitating pain to patients concerned. The incidence of this fracture type correlates with the appearance of osteoporosis in the elderly population. A polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement injection procedure called sacroplasty has been recently described as an optional method for the treatment of this fracture type. However, the correct cement placement in the complex anatomical structure of the sacrum is a surgical challenge. The aim of the study is to compare the precision, safety, and radiation exposure of standard multiplanar fluoroscopy and computed tomography (CT) guidance for PMMA application to the sacrum using both balloon-assisted sacroplasty and conventional sacroplasty. A controlled experimental investigation in a human cadaver trial has been performed. Two imaging and two application modalities to monitor percutaneous PMMA injection to the sacrum were examined. The application forms were randomized from side to side of the pelvis. We found less cement extravasation in the CT-guided groups, but also a significant higher radiation exposure (P < 0.05) by using CT guidance. The conventional fluoroscopy-guided sacroplasty revealed the shortest procedure time (incision to closure time) of all treatment groups (P < 0.01). These findings show no difference regarding cement extravasation between ballon-assisted and conventional sacroplasty. Further, in comparison to fluoroscopy-assisted technique, the CT-guided cement injection seems to decrease the risk of cement extravasation, irrespective of the use of an additional balloon assistance. However, we have to consider a greater radiation exposure using CT guidance. Further investigations will proof the suitability in the normal course of clinical life.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the actual trial was to compare the rate of cement leakage by quantitative volumetry comparing viscosity-controlled and non-viscosity-controlled vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a widespread safe and effective technique in the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures and vertebral metastatic lesions. However, cement leakage has been identified as a problem of this technique. The leakage rates are reported to range from 7% to 90%. The main influence factor for leakage has been demonstrated to be cement viscosity. Assessment of appropriate injection viscosity is highly subjective and observer dependent. Viscosity-controlled vertebroplasty (Vertecem system) has been developed to objectively measure cement viscosity before injection. It introduces a viscosimeter to measure the actual cement viscosity before injection into the vertebra, and therefore may prevent leakages resulting from low-viscosity cement injections. Despite more than 800 Pubmed citations on PVP, there is only 1 report on distinct measurement of cement leakage by semiquantitative volumetry. METHODS: A total of 111 vertebrae in 68 patients, in which PVP was performed for osteoporotic fractures, were included. Thirty-seven patients (76 operated vertebrae) were assessed prospectively using the viscosity-controlled vertebroplasty. The results were compared with a retrospective group of 31 patients (35 operated vertebrae) undergoing PVP without using a viscosimeter. RESULTS: : There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the applied volume of cement per fractured vertebra (P=0.73). The frequency of cement leakage in viscosimete-assisted vertebroplasty was 42.1% and 58.3% in the historic group. Cement leakage into the basivertebral vein (type B), was detected in 6.6% with and in 11.1% without viscosimetry. CONCLUSIONS: The use of viscosity-controlled vertebroplasty led to a decrease in the leakage rate from 58.3% to 42.1%. Leakage into the basivertebral vein with the risk of compression of nerval structures was reduced to almost 50% when viscosimetry was performed. It revealed to be a helpful tool for more unexperienced surgeons to assess the appropriate viscosity for vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

Kallmes,2014.0,Racial and health insurance disparities of inpatient spine augmentation for osteoporotic vertebral fractures from 2005 to 2010,10.3174/ajnr.A4044,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are frequently utilized in the treatment of symptomatic vertebral body fractures. While prior studies have demonstrated disparities in the treatment of back pain and care for osteoporotic patients, disparities in spine augmentation have not been investigated. We investigated racial and health insurance status differences in the use of spine augmentation for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2005 to 2010, we selected all discharges with a primary diagnosis of vertebral fracture (International Classification of Diseases-9 code 733.13). Patients who received spine augmentation were identified by using International Classification of Diseases-9 procedure code 81.65 for vertebroplasty and 81.66 for kyphoplasty. Patients with a diagnosis of cancer were excluded. We compared usage rates of spine augmentation by race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander) and insurance status (Medicare, Medicaid, self-pay, and private). Comparisons among groups were made by using chi(2) tests. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was fit to determine variables associated with spine augmentation use. RESULTS: A total of 228,329 patients were included in this analysis, of whom 129,206 (56.6%) received spine augmentation. Among patients with spine augmentation, 97,022 (75%) received kyphoplasty and 32,184 (25%) received vertebroplasty; 57.5% (92,779/161,281) of white patients received spine augmentation compared with 38.7% (1405/3631) of black patients (P < .001). Hispanic patients had significantly lower spine augmentation rates compared with white patients (52.3%, 3777/7222, P < .001) as did Asian/Pacific Islander patients (53.1%, 1784/3361, P < .001). The spine augmentation usage rate was 57.2% (114,768/200,662) among patients with Medicare, significantly higher than that of those with Medicaid (43.9%, 1907/4341, P < .001) and those who self-pay (40.2%, 488/1214, P < .001).

Kallmes,2016.0,Outcomes of vertebroplasty compared with kyphoplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011714,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many studies demonstrate that both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are superior to conservative therapy in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the outcomes of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, which included prospective non-randomized, retrospective comparative, and randomized studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Web of Science databases for studies of kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty from 1 January 1990 to 30 November 2014 and compared the following outcomes: procedure characteristics, pain and disability improvement, complications and anatomic outcomes. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing pain outcomes based on the risk of bias. RESULTS: 29 studies enrolling 2838 patients (1384 kyphoplasty and 1454 vertebroplasty) were included. 16 prospective non-randomized studies, 10 retrospective comparative studies, and 3 randomized controlled studies were included. No significant differences were found in mean pain scores between the two groups postoperatively (2.9+/-1.5 kyphoplasty vs 2.9+/-1.7 vertebroplasty, p=0.39) and at 12 months (2.7+/-1.8 kyphoplasty vs 3.2+/-1.8 vertebroplasty, p=0.64). No significant differences were found in disability postoperatively (34.7+/-7.1 kyphoplasty group vs 36.3+/-7.8 vertebroplasty group, p=0.74) or at 12 months (28.3+/-16 kyphoplasty group vs 29.6+/-13.9 vertebroplasty group, p=0.70). Kyphoplasty was associated with lower odds of new fractures (p=0.06), less extraosseous cement leakage (p<0.01), and greater reduction in kyphotic angle (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was found between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in short- and long-term pain and disability outcomes. Further studies are needed to better determine if any particular subgroups of patients would benefit more from vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in the treatment of vertebral body compression fractures.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,X. H. Gu; H. L. Yang; Z. Zhang,2009.0,[Transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the selective treatment of osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures in vitro],", ","OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of using transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty for aged osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures with an in vitro model. METHODS: Simulated osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures were created in 11 vertebral bodies. The burst fractures without obvious canal occupation were confirmed by spiral CT before the procedure. This operation involved the percutaneous insertion of two inflatable bone tamps into a fractured vertebral body transpedicularly under fluoroscopic guidance. Inflation of the bone tamp elevated the endplates, restored the vertebral body height, while created a cavity to be filled with bone cement. Preoperative and postoperative heights were measured, preoperative and postoperative sagittal diameter of vertebral canals were measured, and the repaired vertebral bodies were compressed to determine strength and stiffness values. The cement distribution and extravasation was evaluated by spiral CT after the procedure. RESULTS: The transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty resulted in the significant restoration of the vertebral body height. The mean vertebral body heights was (20.73 +/- 1.37) mm before operation and (24.82 +/- 1.61) mm after operation (P < 0.01). Preoperative and postoperative sagittal diameter of vertebral canals were similar (P > 0.05). The cement distribution was regular, and the extravasation into spinal cannula was found in one case. The preoperative strength was significantly larger than the postoperative strength, whereas the postoperative stiffness was significantly less than the preoperative stiffness (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty is an effective way to treat aged osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures without obvious canal occupations and neurologic deficit in vitro. The procedure can increase strength and restore height of aged osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures. Cement distribution and vertebral canal stenosis can be avoided.",chi,0.0

METHODS: Twenty patients with a mean age of 73.6 years (range 65-85 years) who sustained fresh thoracic or lumbar osteoporotic VCFs without neurological deficits underwent minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation combined with PVP. Visual analog scale pain scores were recorded, and the Cobb angles and the central and anterior vertebral body (VB) heights were measured on the lateral radiographs before surgery and immediately, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: The patients were followed up for an average of 26 months (range 24-30 months) after sugery. The visual analog scale score was found to be significantly decreased; from 7.3 +/- 1.3 before surgery to 1.2 +/- 0.7 immediately after surgery and to 0.7 +/- 0.7 (p < 0.001) at the end of follow-up. The Cobb angle was 17.0 degrees +/- 4.3 degrees before surgery and 6.4 degrees +/- 3.6 degrees immediately after surgery. The central VB height that was 44.5% +/- 7.6% before surgery increased to 74.6% +/- 6.4% of the estimated intact central height immediately after surgery (p < 0.001). The anterior VB height increased from 50.7% +/- 7.4% before surgery to 82.5% +/- 6.7% of the estimated intact anterior height immediately after surgery (p < 0.001). There were no significant changes in the results obtained over the follow-up time period. There was no occurrence of new fracture in surgically treated or adjacent vertebrae in these patients.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with metastatic spinal tumors and malignant vertebral compression fractures were treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty and interventional tumor removal. Insertion of a 14-gauge needle and guidewire into the vertebral body was followed by sequential dilation of the track with working cannulae until the last cannula reached the anterior portions of the pedicle. Interventional tumor removal was performed with marrow nucleus rongeurs, and 5-10 mL of cement was injected into the treated vertebra. Outcome data (visual analog scale score, Oswestry disability index score, and Karnofsky performance scale score) were collected preoperatively; 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure; and every 6 months thereafter until death. RESULTS: The overall clinical assessment at the last follow-up evaluation showed that pain was completely resolved in 23 patients, decreased in six patients, and unimproved in two patients, yielding a pain relief rate of 94%. The average preoperative visual analog scale score was 7.2, which decreased to 2.4 at 1 month, 1.9 at 6 months, and 1.6 at 1 year and was maintained at 1.3 at the follow-up evaluations performed after more than 1 year. Statistically significant improvement in Oswestry disability index and Karnofsky performance scale scores was also seen between the preoperative evaluation and every follow-up assessment postoperatively (p<0.001).

But some studies showed the recurrent fracture of a previously operated vertebra or adjacent vertebral fracture after PVP or PKP. The purpose of this study was to compare minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation (MIPS) and PVP with PVP to evaluate its feasibility and safety for treating acute thoracolumbar osteoporotic VCF and preventing the secondary VCF after PVP. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with a mean age of 74.5 years (ranging 65 ~ 87 years), who sustained thoracic or lumbar fresh osteoporotic VCFs without neurologic deficits underwent the procedure of PVP (group 1, n = 37) or MIPS combined with PVP (group 2, n = 31). Visual analog scale pain scores (VAS) were recorded and Cobb angles, central and anterior vertebral body height were measured on the lateral radiographs before surgery and immediately, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: The patients were followed for an average of 27 months (ranging 24-32 months). The VAS significantly decreased after surgery in both groups (P < 0.005). The central and anterior vertebral body height significantly increased (P < 0.005), and the Cobb angle significantly decreased (P < 0.05) immediately after surgery in both groups. No significant changes in both the Cobb angle correction and the vertebral body height gains obtained were observed at the end of the follow-up period in group 2. But the Cobb angle significantly increased (P < 0.005), and the central and anterior vertebral body height significantly decreased (P < 0.005) 2 years after surgery compared with those immediately after surgery in group 1, and there were five patients with new fracture of operated vertebrae and nine cases with fracture of adjacent vertebrae.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and six patients with a total of 117 osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) were enrolled in our study. According to the time of kyphoplasty, they were divided into two groups: group 1 (early operation group, who received the operation within 14 days after fracture, n=46) and group 2 (delayed operation group, who received the operation between 15 and 28 days after fracture, n=71). Preoperative and postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were compared 3 days after surgery within each group and between the two groups. The radiographic outcomes were evaluated by the restoration rate (RR) of the treated vertebrae. The outcome of cement leakage was assessed after surgery using X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans. Leaks of cement were classified into three types: those via the basivertebral vein (type B), via the segmental vein (type S) and through a cortical defect (type C). RESULTS: The mean VAS and ODI scores decreased significantly from pre-surgery to post-surgery in each group, as did the RR (p>0.05). There was no significant difference postoperatively on VAS and ODI scores (p>0.05) between the two groups. However, significant differences were observed postoperatively on RR (p=0.045) and vertebrae with leakage (p=0.038). In addition, there was a significant difference on leakage site of type C between the two groups (p=0.032). CONCLUSION: Both early and delayed operations of kyphoplasty can achieve satisfactory clinical and radiographic outcomes for osteoporotic VCFs. The risk of cement leakage during kyphoplasty will decrease obviously in delayed operation; so delayed operation, perhaps 2 weeks after fracture, is more safe and optimal than early operation as far as cement leakage is concerned, especially for vertebrae with cortical defects. But early operation of kyphoplasty is more effective in vertebral height restoration.",eng,0.0

The management of spinal metastasis remains complex, including medical therapy (corticosteroids, chemotherapy), radiotherapy and surgical treatment, or the recent percutaneous mini-invasive approach. The target of all these treatments is to improve the quality of life of patients affected by this type of lesion. Diagnosis of spinal metastasis and then its treatment should be based on the combination of different elements: clinical evaluation, CT, MRI and nuclear medicine patterns, considering the age of the patient, known primary tumour, location of the lesions, single/multiple lesions, pattern of morphology (border, matrix, expansile character, soft tissue extension), density or signal intensity, oncologic instability and expectancy of life.

In routinely performed follow-up CT scans we observed considerable areas of demineralization in CPC processed vertebrae in several patients. To rule out infections or inflammations histological examinations were planned for these patients. METHODS: Ten patients (23-54 years; six men) with significant demineralization areas in CT scans after CPC balloon kyphoplasty were selected. Punch biopsies from these areas were taken in local anesthesia using a biopsy needle. One half of the specimen was decalcified and embedded in paraffin, and sections were examined histologically using hematoxylin and eosin, Van Gieson, and trichrome staining. The second half of the specimen was cast directly in methyl methacrylate and sections were examined by Paragon and von Kossa/Safranin staining. Stained slides were viewed under light microscopy. RESULTS: Bone-punch specimens were taken at 17.5 months (mean) after BKP with CPC. In most cases, the cement was well surrounded by newly formed lamellar bone with very tight connections between the cement and new bone. Unmineralized areas were observed sporadically at the cement surface and adjacent to the implant. There were no pronounced signs of inflammation or osteolysis of adjacent bone. No complications were observed during or following patients' biopsy procedures. CONCLUSIONS: CPC demonstrated good biocompatibility and osseointegration in clinical use, with no evidence of inflammation or osteonecrosis. Demineralized areas in CT scans could be a result of remodeling of the cancellous bone in vertebral bodies.",eng,0.0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of using high-viscosity bone cement via bilateral percutaneous vertebroplasty in treating patients who have osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with intraosseous vacuum phenomena.Twenty osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture patients with intraosseous vacuum phenomena, who received at least 2 months of conservative treatment, were further treated by injecting high-viscosity bone cement via bilateral percutaneous vertebroplasty due to failure of conservative treatment. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by determining the anterior vertebral compression rates, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores at 1 day before the operation, on the first day of postoperation, at 1-month postoperation, and at 1-year postoperation.Three of 20 patients had asymptomatic bone cement leakage when treated via percutaneous vertebroplasty; however, no serious complications related to these treatments were observed during the 1-year follow-up period. A statistically significant improvement on the anterior vertebral compression rates, VAS scores, and ODI scores were achieved after percutaneous vertebroplasty. However, differences in the anterior vertebral compression rate, VAS score, and ODI score in the different time points during the 1-year follow-up period was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).Within the limitations of this study, the injection of high-viscosity bone cement via bilateral percutaneous vertebroplasty for patients who have osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with intraosseous vacuum phenomena significantly relieved their back pains and improved their daily life activities shortly after the operation, thereby improving their life quality. In this study, the use of high-viscosity bone cement reduced the leakage rate and contributed to their successful treatment, as observed in patients during the 1-year follow-up period.",eng,1.0

Li,2010.0,[Selective treatment of aged osteoporosis thoracolumbar vertebrae burst fracture with balloon kyphoplasty],", ","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and the value of balloon kyphoplasty in treating aged osteoporosis thoracolumbar vertebrae burst fracture. METHODS: Between January 2003 and January 2008, 36 thoracolumbar vertebrae burst fracture patients were treated. There were 15 males and 21 females with an average age of 65.4 years (range, 59-72 years). Fourteen cases had no obvious history of trauma, 19 had a history of slight trauma, and 3 had a history of severe trauma. Forty vertebral bodies were involved, including 1 T7, 3 T9, 8 T10, 10 T12, 9 L1, 7 L2, and 2 L4. All patients displayed local pain and osteoporosis by bone density measurement with no neurological symptom of both lower limbs. Balloon kyphoplasty through unilateral (31 cases) or bilateral (5 cases) vertebral pedicles with polymethylmethacrylate was performed at the injection volume of (3.46 +/- 0.86) mL per vertebral body. Before and after operation, the anterior height and posterior height of fractured vertebral body and the sagittal displacement were measured. RESULTS: Two cases had intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage; 1 case had no remission of waist-back pain and pain was released after symptomatic treatment. All 36 patients were followed up 2.3 years on average (range, 1.5-4.0 years). No cement leakage was found with good diffusion of cement on X-ray film. The restoration of the height of vertebral bodies was satisfactory without nerve compression symptoms and other complications. The Visual Analogue Score at last follow-up (2.34 +/- 1.03) was significantly lower than that of preoperation (6.78 +/- 1.21), (P < 0.05). The compressive percentage of anterior height (19.80% +/- 1.03%) of fractured vertebral body after operation was significantly lower than that before operation (25.30% +/- 2.50%), (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in posterior compressive percentage and sagittal displacement between pre- and post- operation (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on roentgenographic scores, balloon kyphoplasty is selectively used to treat aged osteoporosis thoracolumbar vertebrae burst fracture, and the radiographic and clinical results were satisfactory.",chi,0.0

However, there is clinical uncertainty over optimal management. This study aimed to examine the safety and effectiveness of surgical management for treatment of VCFs with osteopenia compared with non-surgical treatment. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search through electronic databases from inception to June 2014, with no limits on study data or language. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treatment of patients with VCFs due to osteopenia were considered. Primary outcomes were pain and adverse effects. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled mean difference (MD) or risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Sixteen reports (11 studies) met the inclusion criteria, and provided data for the meta-analysis with a total of 1,401 participants. Compared with conservative treatment, surgical treatment was more effective in reducing pain (short-term: MD -2.05, 95% CI -3.55 to -0.56, P=0.007; mid-term: MD -1.70, 95% CI -2.78 to -0.62, P=0.002; long-term: MD -1.24, 95% CI -2.20 to -0.29, P=0.01) and disability on the Roland-Morris Disability score (short-term: MD -4.97, 95% CI -8.71 to -1.23, P=0.009), as well as improving quality of life on the Short-Form 36 Physical Component Summary score (short-term: MD 5.53, 95% CI 1.45 to 9.61, P=0.008) and the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis score (short-term: MD -5.01, 95% CI -8.11 to -1.91, P=0.002). Indirect comparisons between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty found no evidence that the treatment effect differed across the two interventions for any outcomes assessed. Compared with the sham procedure, surgical treatment showed no evidence of improvement in pain relief and physical function. Based on these two comparisons, no significant difference between groups was noted in the pooled results for adverse events. CONCLUSION: Compared to conservative treatment, surgical treatment was more effective in decreasing pain in the short,mid and long terms. However, no significant mid- and long-term differences in physical function and quality of life was observed. Little good evidence is available for surgical treatment compared with that for sham procedure. PV and BK are currently used to treat VCFs with osteopenia, with little difference in treatment effects. Evidence of better quality and from a larger sample size is required before a recommendation can be made.

METHODS: Twelve patients (10 females and 2 males) who underwent revision surgery after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty were included. In 4 cases, vertebroplasty was done for two or more levels. Six cases with kyphoplasty were included. Through the retrospective review of the radiographic studies and medical record, we analyzed the etiology of the revision surgery.

The average time to the revision surgery after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty was 15 months. Infection (4 cases) and progressive kyphosis with collapse (8 cases) were the causes for the revision. A solid pattern of inserted bone cement and bone resorption around the cement were noted in the all cases with progressive collapse and kyphosis. CONCLUSIONS: Infection, misdiagnosis and progressive kyphosis were causes of the revision surgery after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. A solid pattern of accumulation of bone cement and peri-cement bone resorption might be related with the progressive collapse.",eng,1.0

However, complications related to these procedures have been increasingly reported. We describe a case of bone cement dislodgement following cement augmentation procedure for osteoporotic spinal fracture by reviewing the patient's medical records, imaging results and related literatures. A 73-year-old woman suffering back and buttock pain following a fall from level ground was diagnosed as an osteoporotic fracture of the 11th thoracic spine. Percutaneous kyphoplasty was performed for this lesion. Six weeks later, the patient complained of a recurrence of back and buttock pain. Radiologic images revealed superior dislodgement of bone cement through the 11th thoracic superior endplate with destruction of the lower part of the 10th thoracic spine. Staged anterior and posterior fusion was performed. Two years postoperatively, the patient carries on with her daily living without any significant disability. Delayed bone cement dislodgement can occur as one of complications following bone cement augmentation procedure for osteoporotic spinal fracture. It might be related to the presence of intravertebral cleft, lack of interdigitation of bone cement with the surrounding trabeculae, and possible damage of endplate during ballooning procedure.",eng,1.0

Group 1 consisted of 39 patients, in whom there was no associated intravertebral cleft, whilst group 2 comprised 12 patients with an intravertebral cleft. The Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were recorded prospectively. The radiological evidence of kyphotic deformity, vertebral height, leakage of cement and bone resorption around the cement were studied retrospectively, both before and after operation and at the final follow-up. The ODI and VAS scores in both groups decreased after treatment, but the mean score in group 2 was higher than that in group 1 (p = 0.02 (ODI), p = 0.02 (VAS)). There was a greater initial correction of the kyphosis in group 2 than in group 1, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, loss of correction was greater in group 2. Leakage of cement was seen in 24 (41.4%) of 58 vertebrae (group 1, 32.6% (15 of 46); group 2, 75% (9 of 12)), mainly of type B through the basal vertebral vein in group 1 and of type C through the cortical defect in group 2. Resorption of bone around the cement was seen in three vertebrae in group 2 and in one in group 1. There were seven adjacent vertebral fractures in group 1 and one in group 2. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is an effective treatment for osteoporotic compression fractures with or without an intravertebral cleft. Nonetheless, higher rates of complications related to the cement must be recognised in patients in the presence of an intravertebral cleft.",eng,1.0

Cusick,2005.0,Treating osteoporotic and neoplastic vertebral compression fractures with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty,10.1089/jpm.2005.8.931,"BACKGROUND: Compression fractures are common in patients with osteoporosis and cancer. In particular, vertebral compression fractures are crippling, and pose an additional risk of cord compression. Although a number of nonmedical options such as bracing and exercise programs may help these patients, the combination of constant, severe pain and spinal instability was until recently almost invariably synonymous with painful gradual deterioration and a poor quality of life. Vertebroplasty, and more recently kyphoplasty, are minimally invasive procedures that aim at limiting or reversing painful collapse of the vertebrae, while providing stability to the treated segment of the spine. As these new options are highly effective and involve minimal risk, it is important that physicians be familiar with them. OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the demographics of vertebral compression fractures, both osteoporotic and neoplastic, the technical aspects of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, and current results and outcomes. RESULTS: Pain relief rates in excess of 90% have been reported with both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures. Procedural complication rates should be very low, in the 1%-2% range at most with proper technique. CONCLUSIONS: Until the advent of vertebroplasty, almost no effective therapeutic option could be offered to patients suffering from neoplastic or osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, which are relatively common and often crippling. The technical feasibility of these procedures is high, the risk low, and the effectiveness high. Therefore, it is important that physicians consider vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty as viable and strong options.",eng,0.0

Most likely, pain relief is because of stabilization of microfractures. The biomechanical effects of vertebral fracture and subsequent vertebral augmentation therapy, however, are topics for continued investigation. Altered biomechanical stresses after treatment may affect the risk of adjacent fracture in an osteoporotic patient; that risk may be different after vertebral augmentation with cavity creation (balloon assisted vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) when compared with vertebral augmentation without cavity creation (vertebroplasty). Polymethyl methacrylate cement used in these procedures may have an important effect on the load transfer and disk mechanics, and therefore, the variables of cement volume, formulation, and distribution should also be evaluated. Finally, the question of whether prophylactic treatment of adjacent intact levels is indicated must be considered.",eng,0.0

Under local anesthesia Kypho-X vertebra expander was inserted into the vertebral body and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement was filled. Then the patients were followed up for 6 months (6-24 months) by using the visual analog scale, Oswestry disability index (ODI), and the vertebra height and kyphosis were analyzed. RESULTS: All patients underwent the procedure safely. Except for two cases with complication of para-vertebra cement leakage no other complication occurred. The average surgery time was 55 min. All patients became able to get up of bed 2 days and discharged 7 days postoperatively and continued to be protected by hard prosthesis for two weeks more. The average score of VAS was 8.7 before the operation, and then gradually decreased, to 3.2 and 2.7 1 and 4 weeks postoperatively, and became 2.1 at the last follow-up (all P < 0.05). The average ODI score was 72.3 before the operation, and then gradually decreased to 48.6 and 28.9 1 week and 4 weeks postoperatively, and became 22.4 at the last follow-up (all P < 0.05).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 2001 till 2005, seventeen patients were operated on because of unstable type II (according to Effendi) hangman's fractures. The patients were treated either with transoral C2-C3 discectomy with plate-cage stabilization or with posterior direct pars screw repair. The plate-cage group (n=9) comprised patients with a mean age of 34 years, and the average follow-up was 42 months. The screw repair group (n=8) included patients with a mean age of 27 years, and the average follow-up was 28 months. X-rays and computed tomography of the spine were performed before the surgery. X-rays were also performed 2 or 3 days after the surgery, during the 6th week after the surgery as well as at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months thereafter. Fusion and stability of C2 were confirmed on flexion-extension X-rays 6 months after the surgery. RESULTS: In all patients C1-C2 motion was preserved and bone fusion with good cervical spine alignment was achieved. In the plate-cage group, an extension of the head that is needed to reduce flexion types of fracture can cause technical difficulties with the correct plate-cage installation because of interference of the jaw and tongue in the operative field. One patient of the group experienced a chronic infection which was resolved by plate-cage removal. Patients in the screw repair group healed uneventfully without complications. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior transoral plate-cage stabilization is indicated for type II fracture with extension displacement and posterior direct pars screw repair for flexion displacement. Nevertheless, posterior direct pars screw repair seems to be safer, cheaper and more technically feasible.",eng,1.0

Their prevalence can be expected to increase with the ageing population. Until recently, only conservative management has been available to alleviate pain and improve mobility. Originally developed in the 1980s to treat vascular malformation in the spine, vertebroplasty offers an interventional method for improving symptoms of vertebral compression fractures. Percutaneous vertebroplasty involves stabilisation of the fractured vertebral body using cement which is introduced via a needle under image guidance. Kyphoplasty is a more recent development in which a balloon is inflated within the fractured vertebral body in order to correct any loss of height before cement stabilisation. There is a lack of major randomised controlled trials on either procedure at present, but evidence of their safety and efficacy is increasing, suggesting that both are more effective than conservative management, with low risk of complications.",eng,0.0

In addition, the relationship between the location and distribution pattern of inserted cement and site of subsequent fractures was investigated. RESULTS: Among 33 subsequent fractures, we found 13 cranial AVFs, 7 caudal AVFs, and 13 remote fractures. The incidence rate of AVFs was 7.3% of 273 patients.

Of 7 caudal AVFs (Group 2), 7 were superior (100%). In 13 remote fractures (Group 3), 10 were superior, 1 was inferior, 2 were overall (76.9%, 7.7%, and 15.4%, respectively). In AVFs, bone marrow edema appeared mainly toward injected cement (P = 0.005). When injected cement made a solid mass rather than interdigitation, the occurrence rate of cranial AVFs was high (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Bone marrow edema of AVFs appeared significantly toward the previous injected cement. This phenomenon supports the idea that the biomechanical effect of injected cement is one of the causative factors which affect the occurrence of AVF after percutaneous vertebroplasty. In particular, when injected cement forms a solid mass rather than interdigitation, the risk of cranial AVF may increase.",eng,1.0

Chung,2005.0,Extrapedicular approach of percutaneous vertebroplasty in the treatment of upper and mid-thoracic vertebral compression fracture,", ","PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical outcome of the extrapedicular approach of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for upper and mid-thoracic vertebral compression fractures in patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Extrapedicular vertebroplasty was performed in painful compression fractures at T4-T8 levels. The assessment criteria were changes over time in visual analog scale (VAS) and mobility score. We evaluated the volume of cement injected, the size of needle required, and complications. RESULTS: Procedures were performed in 27 patients with a total of 34 affected vertebral bodies. Early (within a week) and one year later, clinical follow-ups showed that pain intensity had decreased by 50% one day after operation and later by 70-80%. Mobility scores of all patients were improved immediately after the procedure. Average volume of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) per vertebral body was 3.8 +/- 1.2 ml. Leakage of PMMA occurred in one vertebral level (intradiskal space), but did not cause clinical complications. CONCLUSION: PVP of upper and mid-thoracic spine with an extrapedicular approach is an efficient and safe procedure for treating painful thoracic vertebral compression fracture under a cautious patient selection and meticulous technical procedure.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Clinical data were collected from 120 patients who had L3, L4 or L5 percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) performed from 2008 to 2012 at the single institute. L4 or L5 PVP patients were classified into group 1 and group 2 was for L3 PVP patients. Medical records were retrospectively investigated at 1 month after PVP. Long term follow-up results were obtained at a median value of 22 months after PVP. RESULTS: 75% of the patients in group 1 were not associated with traumatic events, 71% presenting with leg radiating symptoms and 46% requiring an additional decompressive surgery, more often than those in group 2. These differences are statistically significant (p<0.05). The short term medical record review demonstrated that only 73% of patients in group 1 were ameliorated with regard to back motion pain, whereas those in group 2 reported 87.7% rates of amelioration in identical category (p<0.05). The long term follow up confirmed a significantly worse outcome in group 1, with only 55.7% of patients reporting amelioration in their pain or functional status, but 71.7% rate of amelioration in group 2. CONCLUSION: The OCFs at the L4 or L5 level have different clinical characteristics from those at upper levels of the lumbar spine.",eng,1.0

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised controlled trials comparing VP with KP to reach a relatively conclusive answer. METHODS: We searched computerised databases comparing efficacy and safety of VP and KP in osteoporotic fractures. These trials reported pain relief (Visual Analogue Scale), disability (Oswestry disability score) and complications (i.e., cement leakage, incident fractures) as the primary outcome. RESULTS: Eight studies involving 848 patients were identified. The outcome showed that VP is more effective in the short-term (no more than seven days) pain relief. Kyphoplasty had a superior capability for intermediate-term (around three months) functional improvement. As for long-term pain relief and functional improvement, there is no significant difference between these two interventions. Consistently, both interventions have similar risk for subsequent fracture and cement leakage. CONCLUSION: Thus considering the higher cost of the KP procedure, we recommend VP over KP for the treatment of osteoporotic VCFs.",eng,0.0

Main effect sizes were vertebral fracture rates reported in terms of hazard ratio (HR) for time-to-event data or relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcome. Our results do not support the hypothesis that vertebroplasty contributes to increased risk of subsequent vertebral fracture, neither adjacent nor total vertebral fracture. INTRODUCTION: Vertebroplasty has been implicated in significant changes in vertebral strength, vertebral shape, and consequently increased risk for subsequent vertebral fracture, especially the adjacent level. Here, we further tested the hypothesis whether new-onset vertebral fracture is a natural result of osteoporosis or consequence of cement augmentation. METHODS: Relevant literatures were retrieved using PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), supplemented by a hand-search of the reference lists of selected articles. Eligible studies assessed whether increased morbidity of subsequent vertebral fracture is associated with vertebroplasty. Main effect sizes were vertebral fracture rates reported in terms of hazard ratio (HR) for time-to-event data or relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcome. Random-effects model was used to account for clinical or methodological heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS: Thirteen studies with a number of 2,551 individuals (1,631 in vertebroplasty group and 920 in control group) were suitable for this meta-analysis. In trials that reported adjacent vertebral fracture as time-to-event data (two trials, n = 328), we found a similar incidence of vertebral fracture in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) group compared to conservative therapy (HR 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 1.26; P = 0.18). In trials that reported overall vertebral fracture as time-to-event data (three trials, n = 704), vertebroplasty was associated with a slightly increased but non-significant risk for vertebral fracture (HR 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 2.00; P = 0.65). The outcome was further confirmed in the secondary meta-analysis of studies that reported vertebral fracture as dichotomous data. Subgroup analysis according to study design revealed no difference either. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the hypothesis that vertebroplasty contributes to increased risk of subsequent vertebral fracture, neither adjacent nor total vertebral fracture. However, adequately designed randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm the present findings.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To determine the malignancy rate and histology in bone biopsies obtained during PVP for VCF. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF) affect approximately 20% of postmenopausal women and can lead to long-term disability. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a minimally invasive procedure, primarily used in patients with severe pain after VCF. Even with a thorough clinical examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and blood samples, some fractures maybe caused by an underlying malignant disease. METHODS: 144 consecutive patients underwent PVP for painful VCF, at the Center for Spine Surgery and Research, Middelfart Hospital. All patients had bone biopsies obtained during the PVP, and these biopsies were sent to the Department for Pathology at Vejle Sygehus for histologic diagnosis. RESULTS: About 144 patients were included in this study. The majority of the biopsy specimens (137, 95.1%) were acceptable for histological diagnosis. One hundred and twenty nine (89.6%) biopsies showed no signs of malignancy. Seven (4.9 %) were positive for malignancy. One biopsy was positive for MGUS. Seven (4.9 %) of the biopsies were unsuitable for histologic diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our study shows an incidence of unsuspected malignancy in biopsies during PVP of 4.9%. Conservative treatment with analgesics and brace can potentially delay diagnosis and treatment of underlying malignant disease. We recommend biopsy during PVP as a standard procedure, to insure not to overlook any underlying malignancy despite the MRI-scan, blood analysis, and clinical examination being inconspicuous.",eng,1.0

Ito,2010.0,Nationwide survey of current medical practices for hospitalized elderly with spine fractures in Japan,10.1007/s00776-009-1411-2,"BACKGROUND: The status of hip fracture incidence and treatment is well known through nationwide surveys in Japan. However, there have been no similar studies on spine fractures. Therefore, we investigated current medical practices for them. METHODS: Altogether, 1200 hospitals were randomly selected for the survey with consideration of region and hospital characteristics. Questionnaire items included the number of hospitalized spine patients, imaging test implementation, type of conservative treatment, use of open surgery and vertebroplasty, and the number of these procedures performed in 2005. RESULTS: Responses were received from 473 hospitals. On the day of response, there were 14 372 hospitalized orthopedic patients (average 32.8/hospital). Among them were 1403 spine fracture patients (3.1/hospital), accounting for 13.5% of orthopedic patients. Of them, 91.9% received conservative treatment. The mean percentage of spine fracture patients who were hospitalized was 39.5%. The most reliable imaging test was said to be magnetic resonance imaging. Casting or bracing was used in most of the institutions. The most common analgesic treatment was oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Open surgery and vertebroplasty were conducted for spine fractures in the elderly at 26.5% and 16.3% of hospitals, respectively. In these hospitals, 624 and 257 patients underwent open surgery and vertebroplasty, respectively, in 2005. CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, more than 90% of elderly patients hospitalized with spine fractures received conservative treatment. Surgical treatment, either open surgery or vertebroplasty, was performed at 30% of the hospitals. This study provides basic data that will contribute to planning improvements in spinal fracture treatment in the elderly.",eng,0.0

During initial positioning of transpedicular vertebroplasty needles in a 73-year-old woman, we encountered unexpected ease of needle advancement resulting in progression of the needle through the anterior cortex of the thoracic vertebral body. The transpedicular needle advanced into the mediastinum and, presumably, the adventitia of the descending thoracic aorta.

This procedure is gaining popularity in the United States. Over 1000 patients had been treated by the end of 2000. However, kyphoplasty is costly (chiefly because the balloon is disposable) and has not been evaluated in carefully designed studies.

The principle is innovative and the procedure deserves further investigation as a potentially effective means of correcting loss of vertebral height.

Journal Article,P. Hardouin; F. Grados; A. Cotten; B. Cortet,2001.0,Should percutaneous vertebroplasty be used to treat osteoporotic fractures? An update,", ","Acrylic cement vertebroplasty is being increasingly used to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), although no controlled studies supporting this trend have been published. Vertebroplasty remains controversial as a treatment for osteoporotic fractures because it is a local response to a systemic disease and because the pain caused by osteoporotic fractures usually subsides within a few days or weeks. Current data suggest that pain severity may decrease by half, on average, in 90-100% of patients. Although vertebroplasty is usually well tolerated, serious neurological complications have been reported in a few patients. The most common adverse event is nerve root pain, usually caused by leakage of the cement into the intervertebral foramen. Whether vertebroplasty is followed by an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures in the adjacent vertebras remains unclear. Resorbable cements are being developed and may provide better results than the acrylic cements used today. At present, acrylic cement vertebroplasty to treat osteoporotic VCFs is appropriate in only a minority of patients selected carefully by a multidisciplinary team including a rheumatologist.",eng,0.0

There are no data regarding the cost of prophylactic vertebral augmentation adjacent to long lumbar fusions compared with the costs of performing revision fusion surgery for patients suffering with this complication. PURPOSE: To perform a cost analysis of prophylactic vertebral augmentation for prevention of proximal junctional acute collapse after multilevel lumbar fusion. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review and cost analysis. PATIENT SAMPLE: All female patients older than 60 years undergoing extended lumbar fusions were reviewed to establish the incidence of proximal junctional acute collapse. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost estimates for two-level vertebroplasty, two-level kyphoplasty, and revision instrumented fusion were calculated using billing data and cost-to-charge ratios. METHODS: Cost comparisons of prophylactic vertebral augmentation versus extension of fusion for patients suffering from proximal junctional acute collapse were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight female patients older than 60 years underwent lumbar fusions from L5 or S1 extending to the thoracolumbar junction (T9-L2). Fifteen of the 28 patients had prophylactic vertebroplasty cranial to the fused segment. Proximal junctional acute collapse requiring revision surgery occurred in 2 of the 13 patients (15.3%) treated without prophylactic vertebroplasty. None of the 15 patients undergoing cement augmentation experienced this complication. Assuming a 15% decrease in the incidence of proximal junctional acute collapse, the estimated cost to prevent a single proximal junctional acute collapse was $46,240 using vertebroplasty and $82,172 using kyphoplasty. Inpatient costs associated with a revision instrumented fusion averaged $77,432. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic vertebral augmentation for the prevention of proximal junctional acute collapse may be a cost effective intervention in elderly female patients undergoing extended lumbar fusions. Further efforts are needed to determine more precisely the incidence of proximal junctional acute collapse and the effects of various risk factors on increasing this incidence, as well as methods of prevention.",eng,0.0

Multiple clinical treatment options are found in literature. Augmentation techniques are promising to reduce treatment-related morbidity. In recent years, there have been an increasing number of reports about extended indication for augmentation techniques. However, biomechanical evaluations of these techniques are limited. METHODS: Nine thoracolumbar osteoporotic spinal samples (4 FSU) were harvested from postmortem donors and immediately frozen. Biomechanical testing was performed by a robotic-based spine tester. Standardized incomplete burst fractures were created by a combination of osteotomy-like weakening and high velocity compression using a hydraulic material testing apparatus. Biomechanical measurements were performed on specimens in the following conditions: 1) intact, 2) fractured, 3) bisegmental instrumented, 4) bisegmental instrumented with vertebroplasty (hybrid augmentation, HA) and 5) stand-alone vertebroplasty (VP). The range of motion (RoM), neutral zone (NZ), elastic zone (EZ) and stiffness parameters were determined. Statistical evaluation was performed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples (p = 0.05). RESULTS: Significant increases in RoM and in the NZ and EZ (p < 0.005) were observed after fracture production. The RoM was decreased significantly by applying the dorsal bisegmental instrumentation to the fractured specimens (p < 0.005). VP reduced fractured RoM in flexion but was still increased significantly (p < 0.05) above intact kinematic values. NZ stiffness (p < 0.05) and EZ stiffness (p < 0.01) was increased by VP but remained lower than prefracture values. The combination of short segment instrumentation and vertebroplasty (HA) showed no significant changes in RoM and stiffness in NZ in comparison to the instrumented group, except for significant increase of EZ stiffness in flexion (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Stand-alone vertebroplasty (VP) showed some degree of support of the anterior column but was accompanied by persistent traumatic instability. Therefore, we would advocate against using VP as a stand-alone procedure in traumatic fractures. HA did not increase primary stability of short segment instrumentation. Some additional support of anterior column and changes of kinematic values of the EZ may lead one to suppose that additive augmentation may reduce the load of dorsal implants and possibly reduce the risk of implant failure.",eng,1.0

There still are many controversies regarding the treatment of this fracture. The therapeutic spectrum ranges from conservative to invasive operative methods with attendant morbidities. The minimal-invasive technique of kyphoplasty has established itself as a common treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and is associated with a low complication rate. The aim of this study is to evaluate the functional and radiological results after kyphoplasty of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures type A3.1, A3.2 and A3.3, who were treated with kyphoplasty, were included in this study. The clinical outcome was measured at follow up with a neurological assessment, the visual analogue pain scale (VAS), the Oswestry Disability Score (ODI) and the SF-36 Health Survey. The radiological measurements, performed on preoperative, postoperative and follow up radiographs, included the sagittal index, the wedge angle and the modified Cobb angle of Daniaux. RESULTS: 26 patients with 23 A3.1, one A3.2 and five A3.3 fractures were treated between 2004 and 2007, including five patients with multiple vertebral fractures. At follow up the Oswestry Disability Score (26.2%) and the SF-36 score (60.1%) assessed a moderately limitation of functional outcome and quality of life without any neurological deficits. Radiological measurements showed a postoperative height restoration and reduction of kyphosis, but at follow up a secondary loss of correction except in five cases. Six minor ventrocranial cement leakages without further clinical consequence were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that kyphoplasty is a safe and feasible method for the treatment of burst fractures. It allowed the correction of the kyphosis, stabilisation of the facture, pain reduction and early mobilisation.",eng,0.0

Journal Article,R. E. Harvey; D. F.

However, few studies have assessed discharge disposition as a reflection of VP efficacy in the inpatient population. The purpose of this study was to compare patient disposition status before and after VP and determine what relationship exists between the treatment and patient discharge status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of inpatients who underwent consultation for consideration of spinal augmentation for treatment of painful vertebral compression fractures. We gathered data concerning patients' demographics, living arrangements before hospitalization, discharge disposition, quantitative and qualitative pain levels, and length of hospital stay before and following VP. RESULTS: Ninety inpatients underwent VP, 73 (81%) of whom lived independently at home before hospitalization. Of these 73 patients, 31 (42%) returned home after discharge, 9 (12%) returned home with home health care assistance, and 32 (44%) were sent to skilled nursing facilities. Six (7%) of the 90 patients resided in assisted-living centers before hospitalization; all of these patients were discharged to assisted-living or skilled nursing facilities. Eight (9%) of the 90 patients resided at skilled nursing centers before hospitalization, and all returned to nursing centers after their hospital stay. Discharge disposition was not significantly associated with preoperative pain levels at rest or with activity (P = .76 and P = .23, respectively) or with postoperative pain levels at rest or with activity (P = .08 and P = .25, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that patients undergoing VP as inpatients are often discharged to rehabilitation centers rather than home, irrespective of their status before hospitalization or their pre- and postoperative pain levels.",eng,0.0

Journal Article,J. Hatgis; M. Granville; R. E. Jacobson,2017.0,Evaluation and Interventional Management of Pain After Vertebral Augmentation Procedures,10.7759/cureus.1061,"INTRODUCTION: A small subset of patients who underwent successful vertebral compression fracture (VCF) augmentation procedures may develop subsequent pain requiring spinal injections. In a retrospective analysis, we determined whether the pain was related to the original fracture site or to another area within the lumbar or thoracic spine. The pain occurred either at the same/adjacent level and/or non-adjacent level as the VCF. Interventional treatments primarily targeted the facet joints, specifically in the form of facet joint blocks and/or radiofrequency ablation to the medial branches. The pattern of facet injections relative to the original fracture level was studied. Additionally, the elapsed time between the vertebral augmentation and the subsequent interventional blocks was also evaluated. METHODS: A total of 56 patients sustained VCFs. 12 of these patients underwent interventional procedures after vertebral augmentation procedures. The level(s) of same/adjacent level and non-adjacent level pain were determined via physical examination and/or imaging studies. These levels were subsequently treated with interventional procedures primarily focused on the facet joints. The time period of the injections varied from two weeks status post-vertebral augmentation to as late as 304 weeks (5.8 years) status post-vertebral augmentation. RESULTS: We performed 25 vertebral augmentation procedures on these 12 patients. 15 lumbar, eight lower thoracic, and two mid-thoracic VCFs were augmented. 9/14 cases of blocks included those performed at non-adjacent levels, whereas 5/14 cases of blocks were performed only at the same and/or adjacent levels as the VCF. For the events in which thoracic VCFs were augmented, 6/7 (or 86%) had developed non-adjacent level pain in areas of the lumbar spine. The time from vertebral augmentation procedure to subsequent pain procedure ranged from two weeks to five plus years. The average time elapsed was 83 weeks. Only one case required blocks performed within the first six weeks after vertebral augmentation. In this case, the blocks included those at non-adjacent levels. A total of 4/12 cases (33%) had a block within 12 weeks of the original vertebral augmentation procedure. Lumbar spine imaging showed that at least 9/12 patients had pre-existing significant lumbar pathology at the time of fracture treatment. This may have contributed to the later development of pain. CONCLUSION: Pain after a successful vertebral augmentation is typically non-acute (i.e., beyond six weeks). Mechanisms other than the primary VCF are usually responsible for non-adjacent level pain, which are present a majority of the time on reviewing the patients' diagnostic studies. These mechanisms usually take many weeks to develop and subsequently elicit pain that requires additional interventional pain procedures. In our study, the pain is usually related to the pre-existing degenerative spondylosis and stenosis rather than the fracture site. This study shows that the facet joints in closely related lumbar degenerative changes are the cause of pain in this patient group. These procedures should be explored with pain after vertebral augmentation, especially in those patients with known or suspected spinal degeneration and/or poor biomechanics.",eng,1.0

This is especially seen in patients with previous or concurrent lumbar VCFs and also in a subgroup that had lumbar stenosis or hip arthroplasty. The altered biomechanics due to associated lumbar stenosis or hip arthroplasty lead to increased mechanical stress on already weakened and deficient sacral alae, which are more vulnerable to osteoporotic weakening than other parts of the sacrum. MATERIALS & METHODS: We studied an overall population of patients with VCF seen clinically and separated the patients into the following groups: patients not previously treated, patients treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty at one or more levels, and patients diagnosed with sacral fractures and treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. We wanted to see if a pattern existed among the patients who had sacral symptoms, were diagnosed with sacral insufficiency fractures, and subsequently underwent sacroplasty. RESULTS: In a review of 79 consecutive patients, over a 24-month period, with VCF who underwent surgical treatment, there were 10 patients who also had sacral insufficiency fractures. Four of the patients had sacral insufficiency fractures without VCF. None of the patients with sacral insufficiency fractures were on treatment for osteoporosis at the time of diagnosis. The following symptoms indicated SIF: lower sacral pain (n = 10), buttock pain (n = 7), lateral hip pain (n = 5), and groin pain radiating to the thigh (n = 4). The average time to diagnose SIF was two months after the onset of pain. CONCLUSIONS: Sacral insufficiency fractures are a frequent cause of both acute and chronic pain; however, they are often missed by the majority of physicians. The frequency of undetected sacral fractures is high. This is due to a number of potential pitfalls, which include both subjective and objective reasons: the patient presenting with vague symptoms, the physician only performing a physical examination of the lumbar spine, and the physician ordering the inadequate standard lumbosacral radiographs, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as automatically relating the pain and other symptoms to preexisting MRI findings that are very commonly found in the elderly population. All of these pitfalls lead to SIFs being overlooked.",eng,1.0

The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate clinical pain score improvement and bone healing following vertebroplasty with a novel bi-phasic ceramic cement. Twenty patients were prospectively treated for compression fractures in a single center in the USA with the injectable bi-phasic ceramic bone substitute. Statistical comparison of pain scores was made during a 12 month follow-up retrospectively against a matched cohort of patients treated with PMMA vertebroplasty by the same neuroradiologist (HPH) in the same setting. The bone remodeling material was also evaluated with histology in a New Zealand white rabbit model. The bi-phasic material demonstrated a pre-operative mean VAS score of 8.5 (+/- 1.6) with a significant post-operative pain relief mean VAS score of 1.8 (+/- 2.5) after one week, which was maintained throughout the 12 month follow-up period. These data are in line with the pain scores for the PMMA treated cohort. CT scans six and 12 months after surgery with the bi-phasic cement showed healing of the osteoporotic fractures. In the rabbit model, histology with the study material showed evidence of incorporation, new bone growth and bone healing in a cancellous bone defect. Both the clinical results and the histologic evidence of bone healing and new bone growth support the application of this new bioinjectable material as an alternative to the use of PMMA for vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) treatment options, with an emphasis on reoperation, complications, costand overall healthcare resource use between 2005 and 2009 in the United States. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Options for the treatment of VCFs include conservative management, kyphoplasty, and vertebroplasty. The cost-effectiveness of surgical intervention for VCF has been criticized, and some suggest their outcomes to be similar to placebo. METHODS: Patients 18 years of age and older who developed a VCF were identified and separated into three treatment cohorts: vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and non-surgical. Propensity score matching was performed to match patients between cohorts. Main outcomes assessed included reoperation, complications, healthcare resource use and associated cost. Outcomes were compared at three separate time intervals (patients at index hospitalization; patients with at least 2-year follow-up data; and those with at least 4-year follow-up data). RESULTS: Twenty thousand seven hundred forty patients were identified with VCFs, yielding 7,290 after propensity score matching. The mean age of the patients was 78+/-12 years; and 5,507 (75.5%) were female. All reoperation rates ranged from 6%-17%, while complication rates ranged from 7%-10%, which did not differ significantly among the three cohorts at all follow-up periods. Overall costs were noted to be significantly greater in both the kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty groups at 1-year follow-up, not at 2-year and 4-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that the treatment of a VCF patient will likely be associated with similar long-term operative and comp{Hazzard, 2014 #766}lication rates regardless of treatment modality.",eng,1.0

We conducted a clinical controlled trial to investigate the effect and outcomes of this technique in such patients. METHODS: Forty-three patients over 65 years old with thoracolumbar burst fractures without nerve injuries were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to treatment with simple PKP (control group, n = 22) or percutaneous short-segment pedicle screw internal fixation with PKP (treatment group, n = 21). The patients were followed for at least 2 years postoperatively and were assessed with regard to clinical and radiological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly with use of visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire. Radiological outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of Cobb kyphosis angle and loss of kyphosis correction. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to preoperative indices. The treatment group had better VAS scores and greater postoperative improvement on the ODI compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Postoperative kyphosis angle correction in the treatment group was superior to that in the control group, and loss of correction postoperatively was significantly less (P < 0.05). In the control group, two patients suffered refractures of the injured vertebra postoperatively and one had a fracture in the adjacent vertebra. No postoperative complications needing management were noted in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with simple PKP, percutaneous internal fixation with PKP is a valuable surgical option for the treatment of selected elderly patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.",eng,0.0

METHODS: From Junary 2009 to Febuary 2011, 60 patients (70 vertebrae) with osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture were included. All patients were treated by bilateral transpedicular balloon kyphoplasty combined with postural reduction, including 10 males and 50 females aged from 59 to 90 years old with an average of 72.1 years old. In ordinary osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture group, there were 38 patients (44 vertebrae) including 7 males and 31 females aged from 59 to 87 years old with an average of (71.8+/-6.1) years old. There were 6 patients with two vertebral fractures, 1 vertebra in T9, 5 vertebrae in T10, 7 vertebrae in T11, 13 vertebrae in T12, 9 vertebrae in L1, 4 vertebrae in L2, 4 vertebrae in L3, 1 vertebra in L4. While in severe osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture group, there were 22 patients (26 vertebrae) including 3 males and 19 females aged from 63 to 90 years old with an average of (72.6+/-7.2) years old. There were 4 patients with two vertebral fractures, 1 vertebra in T9, 2 vertebrae in T10, 3 vertebrae in T11, 9 vertebrae in T12, 6 vertebrae in L1, 3 vertebrae in L2, 2 vertebrae in L3. Operative time, volume of bone cement injection, and vertebral height and changes of Cobb angle before and after operation were observed and compared. Postoperative average recovery rate of vertebral height and correct degree of Cobb angle were caculated and compared, VAS scoring were used to evaluate therapeutic effect. RESULTS: All operations were completed sucessfully, and pain were relieved at 72 h after operation. All patients were followed up from 6 to 13 months with an average of 10.1 months. Postoperative vertebral height, Cobb angle and VAS score were improved better than that of before operation (P<0.05). Operative time in ordinary group was shorter than severe group, while volume of bone cement injection was more than that of severe group. Average recovery rate of vertebral height and correct degree of Cobb angle in ordinarty group was better than that of in severe group (P<0.05). There was no significant differences between two groups in VAS scores before and after operation (P> 0.05). Three cases (3 vertebrae) ocurred bone cement leakage in ordinarty group, while 5 cases (5 vertebrae) ocurred bone cement leakage in severe group, and there was no meaning between two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty could receive satisfied curative effect in treating ordinary and servere patients with osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture, but recovery of vertebral height and correct degree of Cobb angle in ordinary gourp was better than that of in servere group.",chi,0.0

METHODS: Twenty patients who suffered from nonadjacent thoracolumbar fractures were treated by short segmental pedicle screw fixation for burst fracture and by percutaneous vertebroplasty for compression fracture. X-rays, CT and MRI scans were conducted using the same protocol before and after surgery and during follow-up. Pre-and post-operative American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) grades, fusion of fracture sites, visual analog scale (VAS) of back pain, and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were accessed. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for an average period of 12 months. The sagittal profile of the thoracolumbar spine was restored satisfactorily. No patient had neurologic deterioration after surgery, and 9 patients with incomplete lesions improved postoperatively by at least one ASIA grade. The fusion rate was 100%. The average VAS of back pain was 7.6 preoperatively and 3.2 postoperatively. The average ODI was 72.5 preoperatively and 35.5 postoperatively.

METHODS: From September 2006 to August 2010, 19 consecutive patients sustained osteoporotic thoracolumbar severe burst fractures with or without neurologic deficit and were included in this prospective study. All patients underwent short pedicle screw fixation and vertebroplasty. Segmental kyphosis, AVBHr and PVBHr, and Canal compromise were calculated on radiographs pre-operatively, post-operative and at final follow up. VAS, ODI and SF-36 were calculated pre-operatively and at final follow up. RESULTS: Mean operative time was 70.8 min (range 60~100 min) and mean blood loss was 92 ml (range 60~160 ml). The mean duration of their hospital stay was 4.5 days (range 3-7 days). The operative incisions were healing well. Average follow up time was 40.1 months (range 24~72 months). The AVBHr was corrected from preoperative (48.1 +/- 6.8) % to postoperative (94.1 +/- 1.7) % (P < 0.001). The PVBHr was corrected from preoperative (62.7 +/- 4.8) % to postoperative (92.8 +/- 1.8) % (P < 0.001). Canal compromise was corrected from preoperative (37.3 +/- 5.8) % to postoperative (5.9 +/- 2.3) % (P < 0.001). The segmental kyphosis was corrected from preoperative (20.6 +/- 5.3) degree to postoperative (2.0 +/- 3.2) degree (P < 0.001). VAS scores were reduced from preoperative 7.21 +/- 0.86 to 2.21 +/- 0.98 at final follow up (P < 0.001). SF-36 Bodily pain was reduced from preoperative 75.31 +/- 13.85 to 13.74 +/- 13.24 at final follow up (P < 0.001), and SF-36 Role Physical was reduced from preoperative 59.21 +/- 26.63 to 19.74 +/- 22.94 at final follow up (P < 0.001). The ODI scores were reduced from preoperative 81.68 +/- 4.44 to 15.37 +/- 5.54 at final follow up (P < 0.001). All 4 patients with partial neurological deficit initially had improvement. Cement leakage was observed in 3 cases (two anterior to vertebral body and one into the disc without sequela). There were no instances of instrumentation failure and no patient had persistent postoperative back pain.

Li,2008.0,Repeat vertebroplasty for unrelieved pain at previously treated vertebral levels with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures,10.1097/BRS.0b013e318166955f,"STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was performed in patients with a repeat percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) at the vertebral levels previously undergoing vertebroplasty. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose of this study is to examine if a repeat PV is effective on pain-relief at the vertebral levels previously undergoing vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although pain-relief is usually high with the treatment of PV in the painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, there are still about 5% to 22% of such patients experiencing no improvement on pain after PV. A repeat PV at the same vertebrae previously treated with PV may be an option for these patients without a pain-relief. METHODS: Out of 334 procedures of PV in 242 patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures from October 2000 to June 2006 in our institute, 15 vertebrae in 15 patients with unrelieved pain in 4 to 32 days after an initial PV were treated with a repeat vertebroplasty. The clinical outcomes were assessed by measurements of visual analog scale, and the imaging features were analyzed pre- and postprocedure. RESULTS: The mean volume of Polymethylmethacrylate injected in each vertebra was 4.0 mL (range, 1.5-9 mL) in the repeat PV. During the first month of follow-up after repeat PV in this series, a mean visual analog scale scores of the pain level was reduced from 8.6 (range, 7-10) preprocedure to 1.67 points (range, 0-4) postprocedure, with a mean reduction of 6.93 points (range, 4-8). Complete and partial pain relief were reached in 11 (73%) and 4 patients (27%), respectively in a mean follow-up of 15 months. No serious complications related to the procedures occurred, but asymptomatic Polymethylmethacrylate leakage around vertebrae was demonstrated on radiograph or computed tomography in 2 patients. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this series suggest that repeat PV is effective at the same vertebral levels in patients without pain-relief who underwent previous PV. Absent or inadequate filling of cement in the unstable fractured areas of the vertebral body may be responsible for the unrelieved pain after the initial PV.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Retrospective review was conducted on 45 consecutive patients with 53 symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas associated with chronic pain (all cases) or paralysis caused by spinal cord compression (1 case) or vertebral compression fractures (3 cases) treated with PVP at our institution to define two populations. Group A consisted of 27 vertebral hemangiomas in 23 patients who underwent intraosseous venography before injection polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Group B consisted of 26 vertebrae in 22 patients who underwent injection PMMA without prior venography. CT was done 1 to 3 days after PVP to observe PMMA distribution in vertebrae and whether leakage. Clinical outcomes, included pain relief, leakage of PMMA, volume of PMMA injected, expense and X-ray exposure times in each vertebral body, were compared in the two groups by using chi(2) or t test.
RESULTS: No significant difference was seen between the groups with respect to age, sex, the number of treated vertebrae, or preprocedural degrees of pain. The successful rate of technique of PVP was 100%. The mean volume of PMMA injected in each vertebra was 3.96 ml. CR, PR and NR was obtained respectively 84.5%, 13.3% and 2.2% during 6 months to 5 years of follow-up expect one case had unrelieved pain in group A. At 6 months after PVP, 22 cases (95.7%) in group A and 22 cases (100%) in group B achieved adequate pain relief (P = 0.323). 6 vertebrae (6/27) in group A and 2 vertebrae (2/26) in group B with asymptomatic leakage of PMMA were demonstrated by CT (P = 0.140). The mean volume of PMMA injected in each vertebra was 3.70 ml in group A and 4.23 ml in group B (P = 0.157). The mean expense of each vertebra was 7.24 x 10(3) in group A and 5.84 x 10(3) in group B (P = 0.000), the mean decreases were 1.4 x 10(3) in group B than group A. The mean X-ray exposure times on each vertebral body was 13.28 minutes in group A and 8.78 minutes in group B (P = 0.000), the mean decreases were 4.5 minutes in group B than group A.
CONCLUSIONS: PVP is an effective and safe procedure for treating symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas. Prior intraosseous venography does not significantly improve the effectiveness or safety of PVP for vertebral hemangiomas performed by qualified, experienced operators, on the other hand, it increases the expense and X-ray exposure times of PVP.",Chinese,0.0

However, its long-term effectiveness and safety for use in the treatment of symptomatic Schmorl's nodes (SNs) refractory to conservative treatment is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To present a case series with PVP for symptomatic SNs not responding to conservative therapy and assess the effectiveness and safety for such treatment with long-term follow-up. To present a review of the literature regarding SNs and treatment options. STUDY DESIGN: Single center retrospective observational study. SETTING: This study consists of patients from a large academic center in China. METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2013, 11 patients suffering from symptomatic SNs that were refractory to medical or physical therapy, underwent PVP procedures in our department. All patients had a definitive diagnosis of SNs by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). The visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed preoperatively at 4 hours, at one month, and every 6 months postoperatively during the long-term (mean: 58.0 months) follow-up period.

METHODS: From August 2007 to August 2010, 22 old patients with thoracolumbar fractures were treated with pedicle screw at the fracture level and vertebroplasty via paraspinal approach. There were 14 males and 8 females, ranging in age from 60 to 71 years (mean, 64.6 years). The time from injury to surgery varied from 1 to 4 d (mean,2.7 d). All the patients suffered from single thoracolumbar fractures and located at T11 in 2 cases, at T12 in 5 cases, at L1 in 11 cases and at L2 in 4 cases. According to the Denis fracture classification, there were 6 compression fractures and 16 burst fractures. The mean preoperative load-sharing classification of spine fractures was 5.4 score. The mean preoperative thoracolumbar injury classification and scoring was 5.2. Based on the ASIA neurologic grading system, preoperative neurological function was grade B in 2 cases,grade C in 3 cases, grade D in 7 cases and grade E in 10 cases. The neurological function, vertebral central and anterior height, kyphotic angle of the vertebral fractures by radiographs and visual analog scale were calculated pre-operatively, post-operatively and at the last follow-up. RESULTS: Median operating time was 60.8 min (ranged from 50 to 95 min) and median blood loss was 84 ml (ranged from 50 to 130 ml). The operative incisions were healed well. The duration of follow-up averaged 21.6 months (ranged from 12 to 48 months). The anterior vertebral body height was corrected from preoperative (52.3 +/- 10.3) % to postoperative (6.1 +/- 4.2) % and (6.8 +/- 5.4) % at the last follow-up. The central vertebral body height was corrected from preoperative (38.9 +/- 11.2) % to postoperative (8.3 +/- 4.7) % and (9.4 +/- 4.5)% at the last follow-up. The Cobbs angle of the injured vertebral segment was corrected from preoperative (19.5 +/- 9.5) degrees to postoperative (4.3 +/- 4.1) degrees and (6.2 +/- 4.7) degrees at the last follow-up. The VAS scores reduced from preoperative 8.56 +/- 0.88 to post-operative 3.48 +/- 0.91 and 3.20 +/- 0.92 at the last follow-up. The postoperative neurologic function of all 22 patients improved 1 to 2 degrees except 10 patients of grade E. There were no instances of instrumentation failure and no patient had persistent postoperative back pain. CONCLUSION: The pedicle screw at the fracture level and vertebroplasty via paraspinal approach has the advantages of less invasive and blood loss, and could prevent the development of kyphosis and offers improvement of the spinal cord function. Furthermore, it could decrease the risks of postoperative back pain and the failure of instrumentation.",chi,0.0
Journal Article,X. He; H. Li; Y. Meng; Y. Huang; D. J. Hao; Q. Wu; J. Liu,2016.0,Percutaneous Kyphoplasty Evaluated by Cement Volume and Distribution: An Analysis of Clinical Data,", ","BACKGROUND: Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) could achieve rapid pain relief for older patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Bone cement in PKP was the key factor keeping the stabilization of the vertebral body. However, the same amount of cement can distribute differently in a vertebral body and can thereby result in different surgery outcomes. Therefore, the volume and distribution of bone cement should be considered as 2 distinct variables to evaluate the effectiveness of PKP. OBJECTIVES: On the basis of comparing surgery outcomes between patients with different recovery states measured by visual analog scores (VAS) and exploring the relationships among bone cement, surgery outcomes, and degrees of pain relief, the objective of the study is to determine the best combination of cement volume and cement distribution for PKP. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: There were 220 patients with 220 vertebra who received PKP in our hospital from January 2011 to January 2013. According to the different pain relief degrees, patients were divided into 2 groups. The epidemiological data, surgical outcomes, and complications were compared between the 2 groups. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to analyze the diagnostic value of bone cement on patient recovery state. A correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationships between bone cement and surgery outcomes. Moreover, logistic regression was also used to assess the safety of cement injection. RESULTS: There were 77 recuperators and 143 non-recuperators in our study. There were no differences in epidemiological data between the 2 groups. However, the surgery duration, cement volume, cement distribution, restoration rate of vertebral height, and improvement of kyphotic angle in the recuperator group were all higher than those in the non-recuperator group. The area under the ROC curve of cement distribution as a predictor of pain relief was better than that of cement volume (0.77 vs. 0.65, P < 0.05). Cement distribution had a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 84% when it was at 0.49. Cement volume had a sensitivity of 49% and a specificity of 82% when it was at 3.80 mL. All patients were then divided into 4 parts based on the 2 values. Extensive cement distribution (more than or equal to 0.49) was discovered to noticeably increase the recuperative rate both for a small cement volume (less than 3.80 mL) and a large cement volume (more than or equal to 3.80 mL). A small cement volume with an extensive distribution had the same recuperative effect as a large cement volume with a confined distribution (x(2) = 2.880, P = 0.090). When the cement volume was constant, cement distribution was positively correlated with the restoration rate of vertebral height and improvement of the kyphotic angle (r(2) = 0.207, P < 0.01; r(2) = 0.159, P = 0.02), but cement distribution was not a risk factor for cement leakage or adjacent vertebral fractures (OR = 35.760, 95%CI: 0.096 - 13291.207, P > 0.05; OR = 0.051, 95% CI: 0.011 - 1.032, P > 0.05). Although a large cement volume may contribute to the restoration of vertebral height (r(2) = 0.153, P < 0.05), it was found to be a risk factor for adjacent vertebral fractures (OR = 1.733, 95% CI: 1.158 - 2.595, P < 0.05). LIMITATIONS: The distribution of cement in fractured vertebra was not calcuated accurately. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of cement distribution is better than that for cement volume in relieving patient pain. A cement distribution above 0.49 with a small cement volume should be suggested for PKP. An extensive cement distribution can improve the kyphotic angle and vertebral height effectively, and it does not cause cement leakage or adjacent vertebral fractures.

Journal Article,X. He; Y. Meng; Y. Huang; D. Hao; Q. Wu; J. Liu,2017.0,Factors Affecting Delayed Union of Vertebral Fractures Following Percutaneous Kyphoplasty,", ","BACKGROUND: Although percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) could achieve rapid pain relief for the elderly with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF), some patients still had risks of suffering vertebrae delayed union which led to persisting pain and vertebral collapse. Preventing the delayed vertebral union could reduce the further morbidities and medical costs for patients with OVCF after PKP. OBJECTIVES: To explore the factors involved in delayed vertebral union after PKP in patients with OVCF. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: All data were from Hong-Hui hospital in Xi'an. METHODS: There were 580 patients treated using single-segment PKP between January 2011 and January 2012. Demographics, clinical data, types of vertebral fracture, and surgical data were collected to analyze the factors associated with delayed vertebral union after PKP. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (5%) experienced delayed vertebral union. Univariate analyses showed that preoperative bone mineral density (BMD), cement consumption, intravertebral cleft, restoration rate of vertebral height, and improvement in kyphotic angle were associated with delayed union of vertebrae after PKP (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative BMD (odds ratio (OR) = 0.452, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.207 - 0.987, P = 0.046), intravertebral cleft (OR = 9.156, 95% CI: 3.712 - 22.585, P < 0.001), and restoration rate of vertebral height (OR = 2.731, 95% CI: 1.622 - 4.599, P < 0.001) were independently associated with delayed union of vertebrae. LIMITATIONS: A multi-center study is recommended to confirm our findings and explore the factors related to vertebrae delayed union. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative BMD, intravertebral cleft, and restoration rate of vertebral height could be factors independently associated with delayed union of vertebrae after PKP in patients with OVCF.Key words: Percutaneous kyphoplasty, delayed union, osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.",eng,0.0

Since non-surgical management of these fractures has limited effectiveness, vertebral augmentation procedures are gaining acceptance in clinical practice for pain control and fracture stabilization. The objective of this analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty compared with non-surgical management for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in patients with cancer.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of health economic studies to identify relevant studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty with non-surgical management for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in adults with cancer. We also performed a primary cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the clinical benefits and costs of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty compared with non-surgical management in the same population. We developed a Markov model to forecast benefits and harms of treatments, and corresponding quality-adjusted life years and costs. Clinical data and utility data were derived from published sources, while costing data were derived using Ontario administrative sources. We performed sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of the results. In addition, a 1-year budget impact analysis was performed using data from Ontario administrative sources. Two scenarios were explored: (a) an increase in the total number of vertebral augmentation procedures performed among patients with cancer in Ontario, maintaining the current proportion of kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty; and (b) no increase in the total number of vertebral augmentation procedures performed among patients with cancer in Ontario but an increase in the proportion of kyphoplasties versus vertebroplasties.
RESULTS: The base case considered each of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty versus non-surgical management. Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty were associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $33,471 and $17,870, respectively, per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The budgetary impact of funding vertebral augmentation procedures for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in adults with cancer in Ontario was estimated at about $2.5 million in fiscal year 2014/15. More widespread use of vertebral augmentation procedures raised total expenditures under a number of scenarios, with costs increasing by $67,302 to $913,386.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the use of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty in the management of vertebral compression fractures in patients with cancer may be a cost-effective strategy at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds. Nonetheless, more widespread use of kyphoplasty (and vertebroplasty to a lesser extent) would likely be associated with net increases in health care costs.",English,1.0

Conservative strategies, including bed rest, bracing, and analgesic use, can be ineffective, resulting in continued pain and progressive functional disability limiting mobility and self-care. Surgery is not usually an option for cancer patients in advanced disease states because of their poor medical health or functional status and limited life expectancy. The objectives of this review were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous image-guided vertebral augmentation techniques, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, for palliation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search for studies on vertebral augmentation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures published from January 1, 2000, to October 2014; abstracts were screened by a single reviewer. For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Owing to the heterogeneity of the clinical reports, we performed a narrative synthesis based on an analytical framework constructed for the type of cancer-related vertebral fractures and the diversity of the vertebral augmentation interventions.
RESULTS: The evidence review identified 3,391 citations, of which 111 clinical reports (4,235 patients) evaluated the effectiveness of vertebroplasty (78 reports, 2,545 patients) or kyphoplasty (33 reports, 1,690 patients) for patients with mixed primary spinal metastatic cancers, multiple myeloma, or hemangiomas. Overall the mean pain intensity scores often reported within 48 hours of vertebral augmentation (kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty), were significantly reduced. Analgesic use, although variably reported, usually involved parallel decreases, particularly in opioids, and mean pain-related disability scores were also significantly improved. In a randomized controlled trial comparing kyphoplasty with usual care, improvements in pain scores, pain-related disability, and health-related quality of life were significantly better in the kyphoplasty group than in the usual care group. Bone cement leakage, mostly asymptomatic, was commonly reported after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Major adverse events, however, were uncommon.
CONCLUSIONS: Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty significantly and rapidly reduced pain intensity in cancer patients with vertebral compression fractures. The procedures also significantly decreased the need for opioid pain medication, and functional disabilities related to back and neck pain. Pain palliative improvements and low complication rates were consistent across the various cancer populations and vertebral fractures that were investigated.",English,0.0
Journal Article,R. P. Heaney,2003.0,Advances in therapy for osteoporosis,", ","The current status of detection and treatment of osteoporosis is reviewed. Despite substantial advances in the past ten years, most patients with osteoporotic fractures are still not being treated for the underlying bony cause of the fracture, and most people at risk for fracture are not being offered known protective regimens. The foundation of any therapeutic program is adequate nutrition--specifically protein, calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D. Current anti-resorptive agents reduce vertebral fracture risk by 30% to 50% and teriparatide, a newly approved anabolic agent, reduces risk by up to 80+%. Effective treatments for chronic bony pain that occurs in some patients with spine fractures is affored by two minimally invasive procedures, kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. Some of these chronically painful fractures represent instances of previously unrecognized non-union, and in them low-pressure vertebroplasty produces prompt and lasting relief. Fracture risk reductions with current anti-resorptive agents are at least twice as great as can be explained by drug effects on bone mass. Moreover, risk is reduced within a few months of starting therapy. These observations focus attention on bone remodeling and point to the need for improvement of biomarker technology, since it seems likely that reduction in remodeling activity underlies much of the fracture risk reduction and can therefore be used to monitor therapy.",eng,0.0

Osteolytic compression fractures from spinal metastasis are also becoming more frequently seen because of the longer life expectancy from improvements in chemotherapy. Percutaneous vertebroplasty with PMMA has been shown to be an efficient procedure to treat pain due to these fractures. It is a minimally invasive procedure performed under local anesthesia and sedation. Injection of PMMA provides immediate stability when it hardens, and permits the patient to ambulate without pain. Appropriate patient selection is the key to clinical success. However, this procedure must be treated with respect, and has to be performed by physicians with the necessary training. Otherwise, increased pain, paralysis, and even death may occur from this seemingly innocuous procedure. In this article, I will deal with the background issues of osteoporotic and osteolytic vertebral compression fractures, patient selection, surgical technique, complications, and review of current literature on vertebroplasty.

METHODS: Questionnaires were emailed to 31 institutions performing percutaneous vertebroplasty across Canada. RESULTS: Twenty-three (74.2%) completed surveys were returned, representing data from 1516 vertebroplasties performed by 66 radiologists and surgeons. Preoperative routine imaging and screening practice varies widely. The majority of respondents perform PVP under conscious sedation; however, an anaesthetist is present in only 22% of institutions. Biplane fluoroscopy is used in 43.5% of practices. The preference for unipedicular or bipedicular injection varies: in 7 institutions, a unipedicular approach is used in at least 80% of cases. Patients receive a follow-up by the screening physician in 65.2% of institutions. There were 4 complications requiring treatment. Venous and intradiscal extravasation rates were 20.8% and 25.3%, respectively; however, the vast majority of these were clinically insignificant. CONCLUSION: PVP complication rates reported in our Canadian survey compare favourably with those in the published literature. The number of PVPs performed annually in the institutions surveyed appears small, relative to the figures from the United States. The prevalence of osteoporosis and incidence of vertebral compression fractures in Canada is increasing as the population ages, and demand for PVP is likely to rise significantly in the coming years.",eng,0.0

The injection of cement ensures rapid stabilization of the vertebra and prevents further sintering. This also results in pain improvement. Nonetheless, based on two placebo-controlled trials, this treatment approach has been called into question. However, these studies did not take the technical aspects of the treatment into consideration, and it appears probable that the amount of filler material chosen was too small so that the treatment group also received placebo. Furthermore, it is likely that mostly older fractures were treated so that the effect can no longer be expected to be as pronounced.

The outcome of the procedure is favorable in 84% of patients with a significant pain decrease (from 7.6 to 2.7 VAS). More impressive is the subjective report of the patients about better posture and increased force in their back, allowing them to become more active again.

The surgical technique is similar to the treatment of osteoporotic fractures; however, there is definitely a higher risk for cement leakage and the clinical outcome is not as predictable as in osteoporotic fracture treatment. It is important to realize that cement injection per se has no impact on the tumor itself, but provides stability to the vertebral body.

Little is known about the influence of morphological parameters of the bone on the properties of the bone-cement composite. Furthermore, although generic finite element (FE) models have been suggested as a way to compute the values of these properties, their accuracy has not been established. In the experimental part of this study, we tested bovine cancellous bone and three different polymethylmethacrylate bone cements and determined six quasi-static uniaxial compressive properties of bone-cement composite specimens and 10 morphological parameters of the bone. For the FE work, we used two simulations, one being muFE and the other unit cell FE. In conclusion, we found that (1) for composite specimens, that relative contribution of the cement to the overall response of the composite increases with increasing cement stiffness; (2) the anisotropy ratio is the bone morphological property that exerts the most significant influence on the experimentally obtained compressive properties of the bone-cement composites determined; (3) the accuracy of the computed compressive properties of the composites ranged from low to high, depending on simulation method used. The largest errors, however, can partially be explained by difference in boundary conditions between the experimental testing and the simulation techniques. The lattermost finding points to the potential for simplified FE models being incorporated into automatic material mapping schemes in whole bone vertebra FE simulations.

METHODS: The electronic database maintained by the Departments of Neurosurgery and Anesthesiology-Pain Management at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center was searched for patients who underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty between January 2001 and July 2003. The criteria defining a contraindicated procedure were based on a review of the literature. Group I consisted of patients who did not undergo a contraindicated vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, whereas Group II consisted of patients who underwent one of these procedures even though it may have been considered contraindicated. There were 53 patients with fractures at 132 levels who met the criteria for the study.

INTRODUCTION: PVP using polymethylmethacrylate has become a popular treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. Recollapse of the same vertebrae after PVP has rarely been reported. This study was undertaken to investigate the incidence, characteristics, and predisposing factors associated with recollapse of the same vertebrae after PVP. METHODS: Eleven patients (seven females and four males; mean age, 69.91 +/- 5.49 years), out of a total of 343 patients, developed recollapse of the same vertebra after PVP. The 11 patients who developed recollapse comprised the recollapse group"", while the remaining 332 patients comprised the ""well-maintained group"". RESULTS: Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the incidence of osteonecrosis was significantly higher in the recollapse group than the well-maintained group (p < 0.05). The degree of re-expansion of the compressed vertebral body after PVP was significantly higher in the recollapse group than in the well-maintained group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The most important predisposing factor for recollapse was pre-operative osteonecrosis. Recollapse was not related to trauma. Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with osteonecrosis or pseudoarthrosis has been regarded as a relative indication for PVP; however, the findings of this study suggest that this disease category may be a relative contraindication for PVP.""",eng,1.0

We performed percutaneous vertebroplasty using CaP cement in a 69-year-old woman with L2 compression fracture and an 80-year-old man with L1 compression fracture. Follow-up radiologic studies for both cases showed that heterotopic ossifications had developed around the CaP-augmented vertebral bodies and that the cemented vertebral bodies had recollapsed. Also, subsequent vertebral compression fractures had occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that heterotopic ossification may be complications of vertebroplasty with CaP. Therefore, we strongly recommended that the patients who undergo a vertebroplasty with CaP need strict observation.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To assess for at least 2 years the radiological and clinical outcomes of patients who underwent polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) vertebroplasty to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with avascular necrosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recently, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with avascular osteonecrosis have been treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty. However, there have been no previous multiyear, clinical, and radiological studies of the results of vertebroplasty in the vertebral body with noninfected avascular osteonecrosis. METHODS: Thirty patients were followed for at least 2 years after vertebroplasty. We retrospectively reviewed several parameters, including visual analogue scale score, Oswestry Disability Index, compression ratio, kyphotic angle, injection pattern of PMMA (interdigitation and solid mass), and morphological changes of the PMMA-cemented vertebral bodies. RESULTS.: The vertebral height and kyphotic angle were significantly corrected after vertebroplasty. However, the restored vertebral height recollapsed (P < 0.05), and the kyphotic angle became aggravated (P < 0.05) during the 2 years or longer of postoperative follow-up. Visual analogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index were significantly decreased at postoperative day 1. However, visual analogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index were significantly increased at 24 months postoperatively. There were 4 kinds of morphological changes of the injected PMMA-cemented vertebral body, including heterotopic ossification, fusion with the adjacent vertebral body, bone cement fragmentation and migration, and development of a radiolucent line around the PMMA mass in the vertebral body. CONCLUSION: After vertebroplasty, the compression and kyphosis of avascular necrotic vertebral bodies progressed continuously for 2 years or longer. Vertebroplasty may not provide sufficient stability. Therefore, we strongly recommend that strict observation and follow-up be used after vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the correlation between level-specific preoperative bone mineral density and subsequent vertebral fractures. We also identified factors associated with subsequent vertebral fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Complications of cement augmentation of the spine include subsequent vertebral fractures, leading to unnecessary morbidity and more treatment. Ability to predict at-risk vertebra will help guide management. METHODS: We studied all patients with osteoporotic compression fractures who underwent cement augmentation in a single institution from November 2001 to December 2010 by a single surgeon. Association between level-specific bone mineral density T-scores and subsequent fractures was assessed. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify significant factors associated with subsequent vertebral fractures. RESULTS: 93 patients followed up for a mean duration of 25.1 months (12-96) had a mean age of 76.8 years (47-99). Vertebroplasty was performed in 58 patients (62.4%) on 68 levels and kyphoplasty in 35 patients (37.6%) on 44 levels. Refracture was seen in 16 patients (17.2%). The time to subsequent fracture post cement augmentation was 20.5 months (2-90). For refracture cases, 43.8% (7/16) fractured in the adjacent vertebrae. Subsequently fractured vertebra had a mean T-score of -2.860 (95% confidence interval -3.268 to -2.452) and nonfractured vertebra had a mean T-score of -2.180 (95% confidence interval -2.373 to -1.986).

A T-score of -2.6 or lower gives no additional predictive advantage. After multivariable analysis, age (P = 0.049) and loss of preoperative anterior vertebral height (P = 0.017) are associated with refracture.

Therefore, any surgical procedure must account for these circumstances. In cement-augmented vertebrae, both the overall stability and load transfer to the adjacent structures are influenced by a variety of factors. This has been demonstrated by different findings regarding volume, special characteristics, choice of approach and application, as well as distribution of the cement within the vertebral body. Independent of the well-known good clinical results, these features leave the discussion regarding the most appropriate form of cement-augmenting technique open. In cases where implants are required, there are increasing data to allow for an appropriate choice of stabilizing devices to fit the biomechanical demands in poor bone quality. Thereby, multilevel instrumentation, additive stabilization techniques, cement-augmented pedicle screws and adapted implant designs ensure and increase patient safety. However, regardless of the procedure chosen to stabilize the osteoporotic spine, reconstruction of the column profile appears to be of pre-eminent importance.",ger,0.0

Three hundred sixteen patients with 486 treated VCFs were included in the study according to the inclusion criteria. Patients were kept in regular follow-up using a standardized questionairre before, 1 day, 7 days, 6 months, and 1 year after, and, further on, on a yearly basis after VTP. The incidence of secondary symptomatic VCF was calculated, and anatomical distribution with respect to previous fractures characterized. Mean follow-up was 8 months (6-56 months) after VTP. Fifty-two of 316 (16.4 %) patients (45 female, 7 male) returned for treatment of 69 secondary VCFs adjacent to (35/69; 51%) or distant from (34/69; 49%) previously treated levels. Adjacent secondary VCF occurred significantly more often compared to distant secondary VCF. Of the total 69 secondary VCFs, 35 of 69 occurred below and 27 of 69 above pretreated VCFs. Of the 65 sandwich levels generated, in 7 of 65 (11%) secondary VCFs were observed. Secondary VCF below pretreated VCF occurred significantly earlier in time compared to VCF above and compared to sandwich body fractures. No major complication occurred during initial or follow-up intervention. We conclude that secondary VCFs do occur in individuals after VTP but the rate found in our study remains below the level expected from epidemiologic studies. Adjacent fractures occur more often and follow the cluster distribution of VCF as expected from the natural history of the underlying osteoporosis. No increased rate of secondary VCF after VTP was observed in this retrospective analysis. In accordance with the pertinent literature, short-term and also midterm clinical results are encouraging and provide further support for the usefulness and the low complication rate of this procedure as an adjunct to the spectrum of pain management in patients with severe midline back pain due to osteoporotic spine fractures.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients with painful osteoporotic (57) or malignant (18) vertebral fractures were treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty under fluoroscopic control. Prior to cement injection, osseous phlebography was performed, with 247 phlebographic studies included in the retrospective correlation with radiographic and CT images. Clinical results were assessed by standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: In 69/75 (92 %) patients, pain and mobility improved and medication needed for pain control decreased significantly after vertebroplasty. Two clinically apparent complications occurred. The results of osseous phlebography prompted correction of the needle position in 34/247 (14 %) of the procedures and cancellation of the cement injection in 19/247 (8 %). No complications occurred related to osseous phlebography. CT was superior to conventional radiography in detecting extra-osseous cement leakage (106/247 by CT vs. 63/247 by conventional radiography). The cement leakage was asymptomatic in 104/106 (98 %) cases for the duration of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Osseous phlebography prior to percutaneous vertebroplasty had a significant impact on the procedure in our retrospective study and was able to predict the cement distribution in the majority of cases.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential benefits of vertebroplasty as a preventative treatment. To evaluate the effects of cement volume and bone mineral density on the mechanics of augmented intact vertebral bodies.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many studies have been undertaken to examine the effects of augmentation procedures such as vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty on fractured vertebral bodies. However, the role of such procedures as a prophylactic or interventional tool has not been well studied. This approach may be of clinical interest due to the high occurrence of secondary compression fractures and potentially altered biomechanics following an isolated vertebroplasty procedure.
METHODS: Nonfractured osteoporotic vertebrae were measured to calculate volume and DEXA scanned to obtain bone mineral density information. Randomly selected specimens were injected with 10% and 20% bone cement by volume or left unfilled to serve as controls. After radiographs and noted cement leakage, specimens were subjected to destructive compression testing.
RESULTS: It was found that the injection of 20% bone cement by volume in the lumbar levels resulted in a statistically significant 36% strength increase as compared with the unfilled controls regardless of density levels. However, in the upper thoracic vertebrae there was no significant difference between the strengths of the three groups. Additionally, injection of 20% bone cement frequently resulted in extravasation through vascular channels or into the spinal canal.
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of 20% bone cement by volume results in a significant increase in the compressive strength of intact lumbar vertebrae, however upper thoracic vertebrae do not demonstrate a similar strength improvement. There was no difference in the stiffness of the vertebrae injected with cement regardless of location. Bone mineral density (BMD) may play a role in the magnitude of the strength increase, with lower BMD specimens realizing a relatively greater strength improvement. Cement leakage was frequently noted with 20% cement injection, especially in the specimens with higher BMD. The location of the cement did not appear to have an effect on the loading behavior of the bone but should be controlled to minimize the chance of cement escaping into the spinal canal.",English,0.0

An interdisciplinary concept],10.1007/s00132-004-0669-5,"BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures frequently complain of pain and a loss of function and mobility. Such fractures are associated with an increased mortality. The common treatment with bed rest, bracing or osteosynthesis does not lead to satisfying results. With two new surgical techniques, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, an internal stabilisation of osteoporotic vertebral fractures is possible. METHODS: All patients were treated by kyphoplasty. With a minimal invasive dorsal approach, an inflatable bone tamp is placed in the fractured vertebral body. This tamp can restore the vertebral body height and create a cavity, which is filled with bone cement under low pressure. The advantage of kyphoplasty compared to vertebroplasty is the restoration of the vertebral height and a decreased cement leakage rate. We performed a prospective, interdisciplinary study with a follow-up of 12 months. We treated 192 vertebral fractures in 102 patients. Augmentation was performed with polymethylmethacrylate in 138 cases and with a new injectable calcium phosphate-cement in 54 vertebral bodies. Outcome data were obtained with two different spine-scores and by the radiomorphometric evaluation of x-rays before and after treatment. RESULTS: We noticed a significant improvement in pain and function in 89% of the patients. All patients showed a regain of vertebral height of on average 17%. In 7% of all treated vertebral bodies, we noticed cement leakage, which was, however, far below the rates published for vertebroplasty (20-70%). There were two complications, bleeding due to an unknown coagulopathy and a violation of the myelon by malpunction. CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty is a reliable and minimally invasive method for stabilizing fractured osteoporotic vertebral bodies. Improvement of pain and function and a regain in height of the treated vertebral body can be accomplished.",ger,0.0

Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between the pre-procedural imaging factors and pain relief using Pearson's chi-squared test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Complete pain relief was obtained in 45.5% of patients. An intravertebral cleft larger than half the height of the fractured vertebral body (FVB) was a significant key factor in the complete pain relief group after 3 months. Further, >/=40% of the spinal canal occupied by bony fragments of the FVB was related to incomplete pain relief.

Hirsch,2011.0,The use of vertebral augmentation and external beam radiation therapy in the multimodal management of malignant vertebral compression fractures,", ","BACKGROUND: Vertebral augmentation (VA) techniques such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are increasingly performed minimally invasive procedures for osteoporotic or malignant compression fractures (MCFs) and involve injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement directly into a compressed vertebral body. OBJECTIVE: This article will evaluate the efficacy of VA in relieving fracture-related pain. We also intend to identify procedural and clinical variables that could potentially influence outcomes in this population. In the subset of patients with cancer who received both external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and VA, we will assess the impact of the treatment sequence on pain outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis of 201 cases of patients with cancer and MCFs who underwent one or more vertebral augmentation procedures at our institution between 2003 and 2009. The majority of cancers represented were multiple myeloma, metastatic lung cancer, and metastatic breast cancer. The primary outcome measure was pain relief, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale and a 4-point pain scale. SETTING: We present an institutional experience at an academic medical center of 201 cases of MCFs. METHODS: We compiled an institutional database of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty cases using paper and electronic medical records. Our data collection methodology has been previously reported and includes variables such as procedure dates, gender, age, type of malignancy, fracture etiology, history of cancer treatment, type of procedure performed, vertebral level treated, the number of levels treated per procedure, complications, and follow-up information on pain response. The updated dataset incorporates new variables including information on pain medications and standardized questionnaires such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). RESULTS: In the 201 cases of MCFs, a total of 316 vertebral levels were treated with either vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Follow-up data on pain relief was available for 190 out of 201 cases (95%). Among this subgroup, 168 cases (88%) with MCFs responded. Thirty-nine percent (39%) of the time patients experienced complete pain resolution. In only 4% of cases did patients report worsening of their fracture-related pain post-procedure. There was no difference in pain outcomes with regard to sequencing of EBRT and VA. LIMITATIONS: One of the limitations of our analysis is that it did not evaluate the effect of pain improvement or resolution before and after EBRT alone and on activities of daily living in the majority of patients. However, one of the main goals of this analysis is to address previous limitations. We attempt to standardize outcome measures by using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). CONCLUSION: A multimodality approach for the management of MCFs includes VA procedures. The majority of patients with MCFs have excellent palliation with this approach. In patients who receive both EBRT and VA, the sequence in which they are given does not affect pain improvement outcomes.",eng,1.0

Hirsch,2009.0,Polymethylmethacrylate and radioisotopes in vertebral augmentation: an explanation of underlying principles,", ","We recently reported a novel concept for combining radioactive isotope technology with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement used for vertebral augmentation and have advocated that pain physicians become aware of this new concept when treating malignant compression fractures. The use of vertebral augmentation for malignant compression fractures is steadily increasing, and the goal of this novel approach would be to stabilize the fractured vertebral body while also controlling proliferation of the tumor cells in the vertebral body that caused the vertebral fracture. This approach would therefore provide mechanical stabilization of the fractured vertebral body at the same time as direct targeting of the cancer cells causing the fracture. For our analysis, we investigated six specific radioisotopes with regard to physical and biologic properties as they would interact with PMMA and local bone metastatic disease, taking into consideration anatomical, biological and physical characteristics. The radioisotopes investigated include beta emitting (plus and minus) sources, as well as low energy and mid-energy photon sources and are: P-32, Ho-166, Y-90, I-125, F-18, and Tc-99m. We review the advantages and disadvantages of each radioisotope. In addition, this paper serves to provide pain physicians with a basic background of the biologic principles (Biologically Effective Dose) and statistical modeling (Monte Carlo method) used in that analysis. We also review the potential complications when using radioactive sources in a clinical setting. Understanding the methodologies employed in determining isotope selection empowers the practitioner by fostering understanding of this presently theoretical treatment option. We believe that embedding radioisotopes in PMMA is merely a first step in the road of local treatment for symptomatic local lesions in the setting of systemic disease.",eng,0.0

Torner,2001.0,Comparison of the biomechanics of hydroxyapatite and polymethylmethacrylate vertebroplasty in a cadaveric spinal compression fracture model,", ","OBJECT: Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) has long been used in the stabilization and reconstruction of traumatic and pathological fractures of the spine. Recently, hydroxyapatite (HA), an osteoconductive, biocompatible cement, has been used as an alternative to PMMA. In this study the authors compare the stabilizing effects of the HA product, BoneSource, with PMMA in an experimental compression fracture of L-1. METHODS: Twenty T9-L3 cadaveric spine specimens were mounted individually on a testing frame. Light-emitting diodes were placed on the neural arches as well as the base. Motion was tracked by two video cameras in response to applied loads of 0 to 6 Nm. The weight-drop technique was used to induce a reproducible compression fracture of T-11 after partially coring out the vertebra. Load testing was performed on the intact spine. postfracture, after unilateral transpedicular vertebroplasty with 7 to 10 ml of PMMA or HA, and after flexion-extension fatiguing to 5000 cycles at +/- 3 Nm. No significant difference between the HA- and PMMA cemented-fixated spines was demonstrated in flexion, extension, left lateral bending, or right and left axial rotation. The only difference between the two cements was encountered before and after fatiguing in right lateral bending (p < or = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the same angular rigidity can be achieved using either HA or PMMA. This is of particular interest because HA is osteoconductive, undergoes remodeling, and is not exothermic.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,A. Hiwatashi; T. Moritani; Y. Numaguchi; P. L.

The purpose of this study was to document the frequency and degree of changes in vertebral body height after vertebroplasty. METHODS: The heights of 85 vertebral bodies in 37 patients were measured before and after vertebroplasty. In addition, one adjacent vertebral body was measured in each patient as a control. Twenty-six patients had compression fractures in the thoracic spine, and 24 patients had compression fractures in the lumbar spine. Vertebroplasty was performed with a bilateral transpedicular approach by injecting polymethylmethacrylate, under biplane fluoroscopic control. Measurements were performed on preoperative MR images and on postoperative CT sagittal reformations. Anterior, central, and posterior vertebral body height measurements were obtained in the midsagittal plane. RESULTS: The average increase in vertebral body height was 2.5 mm anteriorly, 2.7 mm centrally, and 1.4 mm posteriorly. Thirteen of 85 treated vertebrae remained unchanged. All control vertebral bodies also remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Vertebral body height often increases during vertebroplasty.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of preoperative MRI for predicting such cement leakage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement of informed consent. We studied preoperative MRI of 46 vertebroplasty patients (107 vertebral bodies). Endplate cortical defect, abnormal T2 hyperintensity in adjacent disk space, intravertebral cleft, degree of compression, and wedge angle were correlated to the incidence of cement leakage into the adjacent disk. Patient age, sex, and location of treated vertebral body were also evaluated. We used logistic regression analysis and Fisher's exact probability test to analyze the association between cement leakage and these observations. RESULTS: Cortical defect in the endplate of the treated vertebral body, abnormal T2 hyperintensity in the adjacent intervertebral disk, and absence of intravertebral cleft were associated with cement leakage into the disk space (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant association between cement leakage into the disk and degree of compression, wedge angle, location of treated vertebral body, patient age, or sex (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cement leakage into an adjacent disk is more common when there is a cortical defect in the endplate and increased T2 signal in the adjacent disk and is less common if there is an intravertebral cleft.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was not required because the donors had registered in and consented to an anatomic gift program prior to their death. Thirty-seven vertebrae were harvested from four donated cadavers of elderly female individuals (mean age, 82 years; age range at death, 73-87 years). The vertebrae were dissected free of the surrounding muscles and imaged with multi-detector row CT. Compression fractures were induced, and the vertebrae were again imaged. The vertebrae were randomized to be treated with kyphoplasty (n = 19) or vertebroplasty (n = 18) and were then imaged at multi-detector row CT. The anterior, central, and posterior vertebral body heights and wedge angles were measured in the midsagittal plane of the reformatted images. The amount of cement injected was determined by weighing the vertebrae before and after treatment. The statistical significance of changes in vertebral body height, wedge angle, and weight with the two treatment techniques was evaluated with the independent t test or Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The increase in vertebral height was greater with kyphoplasty than with vertebroplasty (5.1 mm vs 2.3 mm, respectively; P < .05). The original vertebral height was restored in 93% of vertebrae with kyphoplasty and in 82% with vertebroplasty (P < .05). There was a greater decrease in wedge angle with kyphoplasty than with vertebroplasty (3.1 degrees vs 1.6 degrees, respectively); however, this difference was not significant (P > .05). There was no significant difference in the amount of cement injected with kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty (P > .05).

The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics of patients with new fractures after vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five consecutive patients were treated with vertebroplasty for painful osteoporotic compression fractures at our institution. The charts and radiographic studies of all patients were retrospectively reviewed. Special attention was paid to patient age and sex, imaging studies, long-term use of steroid medication, and treatment for osteoporosis. We used logistic regression analysis and the Fisher exact test for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were treated with vertebroplasty at one time and did not develop new fractures, whereas 20 patients returned with new fractures. Sixteen of 55 patients had been on steroid medication. The incidence of subsequent vertebral compression fractures after vertebroplasty in patients on long-term steroid therapy was 69% (11/16), compared with 23% (9/39) in those with primary osteoporosis (ie, those who were not on steroid therapy). There was a statistically significant association between use of steroids and new fractures (P<.01).

Westesson,2007.0,Vertebroplasty for osteoporotic fractures with spinal canal compromise,", ","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty can aggravate spinal canal narrowing, especially in patients with preoperative retropulsion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in spinal canal dimension during percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic fractures with retropulsion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed all cases of osteoporotic vertebral fractures treated with vertebroplasty. Twenty-one patients (25 vertebrae) had a retropulsed fragment that compromised the dimension of the spinal canal on preoperative imaging. We measured the degree of retropulsion before and after vertebroplasty to evaluate changes in spinal canal dimension. We also evaluated pain, neurologic status, vertebral body height, and wedge angle. RESULTS: Mean retropulsion was 4.2 mm before and 4.4 mm after vertebroplasty. There was no statistically significant difference (P = .32). Mean increase in vertebral body height was 2.6 mm anteriorly, 1.7 mm centrally, and 0.3 mm posteriorly. Mean decrease in wedge angle was 4.7 degrees. There were statistically significant improvements in height and wedge angle (P < .01). None of our patients developed new symptoms during vertebroplasty or thereafter. Twenty of 21 patients (95%) showed partial or complete immediate pain relief, whereas 1 patient did not improve. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty can be performed safely in patients with spinal canal compromise. This procedure can reduce pain, increase vertebral body height, and decrease wedge angle without worsening of retropulsion.",eng,0.0

The purpose of this study was to compare restoration of vertebral body height and wedge angle and cement leakage with kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in osteoporotic compression fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients (57 vertebrae) were treated with kyphoplasty, and 66 patients (124 vertebrae) were treated with vertebroplasty. Cement leakage into the disk space and paravertebral soft tissues or veins was analyzed on immediate postoperative CT scans. The height and wedge angle were measured before and after treatment and analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test and chi(2) test. RESULTS: Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty both improved vertebral body height and the wedge angles (P < .05). However, these differences were not statistically significant when the 2 techniques were compared (P > .05). There were 18% of the kyphoplasty group and 49% of the vertebroplasty group that showed cement leakage into the paravertebral soft tissues or veins (P < .01). Cement leakage into the disk space occurred in 12% of the kyphoplasty group and in 25% of the vertebroplasty group (P < .01). However, no complications related to cement leakage were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty achieved the same degree of height restoration and improvement of the wedge angle. Kyphoplasty resulted in less cement leakage into the disk space and paravertebral soft tissues or veins than vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of cone-beam CT for evaluation before and after vertebroplasty. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 22 consecutive patients (15 women and seven men) with osteoporotic compression fractures (51 vertebrae). Cone-beam CT and 64-MDCT were performed before and after percutaneous vertebroplasty. Multiplanar reformations of the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes were obtained. We evaluated the presence of cortical defects, vacuum phenomena in adjacent disks, and cement leakage, and we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of cone-beam CT compared with MDCT. RESULTS: All 75 cortical defects in 51 vertebrae seen on MDCT were also observed on cone-beam CT (100% sensitivity and specificity). Vacuum phenomena were detected in 33 of 86 (38.4%) adjacent disk spaces on MDCT and in 29 on cone-beam CT (84.8% sensitivity, 98.1% specificity, and 93.0% accuracy). Cement leakage was noted at 17 disk spaces, 15 paravertebral soft tissues, and 12 veins on MDCT. All cement leakages were correctly identified on cone-beam CT.

The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate preoperative multidetector row CT (MDCT) for the prediction of subsequent fractures after vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 26 consecutive patients (18 women and 8 men) with osteoporotic compression fractures (58 vertebrae). A 64-section MDCT with multiplanar reformation was obtained 1 day before the procedure. Subsequent MR imaging was used to evaluate new fractures at least 3 months after treatment on a routine basis or if there was recurrent pain. We used logistic regression analysis with MDCT findings and clinical data for statistical evaluation according to the location of new fractures. RESULTS: Subsequent fractures were noted at 14 adjacent vertebrae (12.1%) in 13 patients and at 14 remote vertebrae in 6 patients (23.1%). Subsequent fractures in adjacent vertebrae tended to occur in small vertebrae before treatment (P < .05). Steroid medication and low CT value in nonfractured vertebrae were associated with subsequent fractures in remote vertebrae (P < .05). Further collapse of the treated vertebral bodies was noted in 10 patients (11 vertebrae [19.0%]) without specific findings (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The small size of the treated vertebrae may relate to subsequent fractures in adjacent vertebrae.

The number and age of the patients, number of treated vertebrae, pre- and postoperative outcome of pain and complications of the different studies were assessed and analyzed. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is an efficient technique with low complication rates and a significant reduction in pain. It rapidly improves the mobility and quality of life of patients with vertebral compression fractures.

Twenty consecutive patients underwent standard PVP procedures under fluoroscopic control. Immediate postprocedure evaluation of the implant distribution in the angio suite (BV 3000; Philips, The Netherlands) was performed using rotational acquisitions (typical parameters for the image acquisition included a 17-cm field-of-view, 200 acquired images for a total angular range of 180 degrees ). Postprocessing of acquired volumetric datasets included multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), maximum intensity projection (MIP), and volume rendering technique (VRT) images that were displayed as two-dimensional slabs or as entire three-dimensional volumes. Image evaluation included lesion and implant assessment with special attention given to implant leakage. Findings from rotational acquisitions were compared to findings from postinterventional CT. The time to perform and to postprocess the rotational acquisitions was in all cases less then 10 min. Assessment of implant distribution after PVP using rotational image acquisition methods and volumetric reconstructions was possible in all patients. Cement distribution and potential leakage sites were visualized best on MIP images presented as slabs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standardized four-view radiographs obtained during 363 vertebroplasties in 181 treatment sessions in 152 patients were reviewed (121 patients with osteoporotic fractures, 30 with malignant disease, and one with hemangioma). Four types of PMMA leakage and other potential predictors (patient age and sex, treated region, number of vertebral levels injected, preprocedural pain, PMMA volume per vertebra) were related to postprocedural pain response and midterm outcome after vertebroplasty. chi2 and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistical analysis. The mean follow-up period was 8.8 months (range, 1-24 months). RESULTS: At the time of discharge after the procedure, pain was absent after 106 of the 181 sessions (58.5%), better after 50 (27.6%), and the same after 25 (13.8%). In 258 of the 363 treated vertebral levels, at least one type of leakage was found. None of the evaluated factors were related significantly to postprocedural pain response, including PMMA leakage. Pain response at midterm outcome was strongly related to postprocedural treatment success, however (P <.001). CONCLUSION: Small to moderate amounts of PMMA may escape from the vertebral body with no significant effect on therapeutic success. Immediate postprocedural pain relief is the best predictor of midterm clinical outcome after vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

The results were compared to our own experience in 22 patients treated in 2002. RESULTS: Over the past decade, vertebroplasty has increasingly been performed for the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures. In good correlation with our own results, all authors reported a significant improvement of pain immediately after treatment and a reduction of pain of up to 90% within 24 h after vertebroplasty. Furthermore, a significant reduction in the use of analgetics and a substantial improvement of functional status has been described in recent studies.

This article addresses indications, patient preparation, technical requirements and approach as well as possible complications of percutaneous vertebroplasty. TECHNIQUE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a technique consisting in an injection of bone cement into a vertebral body under imaging guidance. This procedure is performed to relief pain and support the mechanical stability in partially collapsed vertebral bodies. RESULTS: In the management of spinal compression fractures secondary to osteoporosis, myeloma, osteolytic metastases and aggressive hemangiomas, percutaneous vertebroplasty yields analgesic effect, and provides additional fortification in weakened segments of the vertebral column. Contraindications include major bleeding disorders, radicular pain and pain caused by compression of the myelon. DISCUSSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty results in prompt pain relief and rapid rehabilitation. In experienced hands, using correct technique, pv is a safe and effective procedure for treating pain, caused either by osteoporotic or malignant vertebral compression fractures.",ger,0.0

Bone mineralization density distribution (BMDD) was assessed in trabecular bone of acute, single-level compression fractures of the spine at various stages of fracture repair using quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI). The grading of the repair stage was performed by histological methods. From 20 patients, who underwent either kyphoplasty (n=18) or vertebroplasty (n=2), a vertebral bone biopsy was taken prior to cement augmentation. Six patients took bisphosphonates (BP) prior to fracture. Three study groups were formed: N1=early-, N2=late-healing and B=BP treatment at late healing stage. In general, all groups had an altered BMDD when compared to historical normative reference data. Mean matrix mineralization (CaMean) was significantly (p<0.001) lower in all groups (N1: -5%, N2: -16%, and B2: -16%). In N2, CaMean was -13.1% (p<0.001) lower than N1. At this stage, deposition of new bone matrix and/or formation of woven bone are seen, which also explains the more heterogeneous matrix mineralization (CaWidth). Moreover, BP treatment (B2) led to a significant reduction in CaWidth (-28.5%, p<0.001), when compared to N2. Bone tissue from vertebrae with acute compression fractures reveals a large variation in matrix mineralization depending on the stage of repair. Bisphosphonate treatment does affect the mineralization pattern of tissue repair. The low mineralization values found in early stage of repair suggest that altered bone material properties may play a role in the occurrence of fragility fractures of the spine.",eng,0.0

Hirsch,2004.0,Balloon kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fracture using a unilateral balloon tamp via a uni-pedicular approach: technical note,", ","OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty, like percutaneous vertebroplasty is a therapeutic intervention for painful osteoporotic vertebral body compression fracture. The procedure involves placement of bilateral inflatable balloon tamps in the fractured vertebral body via a bilateral transpedicular or bilateral extra-pedicular approach. We describe performance of balloon kyphoplasty using a unilateral, single, balloon tamp via a unilateral transpedicular approach. The advantages of a unilateral approach are reducing the risk, albeit low, of pedicle fracture, medial transgression of the pedicle and/or transgression into the spinal canal, nerve injury, cement extravasation along the cannula tract, and spinal epidural hematoma. Additionally, operative and anesthesia time is reduced, as well as the costs of balloon tamps, cannulas, and needles. CASE ILLUSTRATION: An 83-year-old woman with osteoporosis presented with severe lower thoracic back pain which occurred when she bent over to lift a heavy box. The pain was reproducible on palpation of the T-11 spinous process. A spine MRI with STIR (short tau inversion recovery) sequence demonstrated a subacute T-11 vertebral body compression fracture with associated edema. A T-11 balloon kyphoplasty was performed using a unilateral inflatable balloon tamp via a unilateral transpedicular approach. The patient reported immediate relief of pain and improvement of visual analog score (VAS) for pain from preoperative 10 to postoperative 2. She was able to ambulate postoperatively whereas preoperatively she was inhibited by pain. CONCLUSION: Balloon kyphoplasty can be performed using a unilateral balloon tamp via a unilateral pedicular approach.

Currently, a new training modality, an augmented reality simulator for minimally invasive spine surgeries, is going to be developed. An important step in investigating this simulator is the accurate establishment of artificial tissues. Especially vertebrae and muscles, reproducing a comparable haptical feedback during tool insertion, are necessary. Two artificial tissues were developed to imitate natural muscle tissue. The axial insertion force was used as validation parameter. It appropriates the mechanical properties of artificial and natural muscles. Validation was performed on insertion measurement data from fifteen artificial muscle tissues compared to human muscles measurement data. Based on the resulting forces during needle insertion into human muscles, a suitable material composition for manufacturing artificial muscles was found.""",eng,0.0

Therefore, new low-modulus cements have been developed; however, there are currently no studies assessing the biomechanical aspects of vertebroplasty with these cements in an ex vivo non-prophylactic model. In this study, we induced wedge fractures through eccentric uniaxial compression to single whole-vertebrae, before and after augmentation with either standard or low-modulus cement. Compressive strength and stiffness of individual vertebrae were measured, on 19 samples from metastatic spines and 20 samples from elderly, osteopenic spines. While both cement types increased the strength of both the metastatic (+34% and +63% for standard and low-modulus cement, respectively) and the elderly vertebrae (+303% and +113%, respectively), none of them restored the initial stiffness of metastatic specimens (-51% and -46%, respectively). Furthermore, low-modulus cement gave a lower total stiffness (-13%) of elderly specimens whereas standard cement increased it above initial levels (+17%). Results show that vertebroplasty with low-modulus cement could provide restoration of the initial stiffness while increasing the strength of fractured elderly vertebrae and hence represent a treatment modality which is closer to pre-augmented behaviour. Also, this study indicates that stiffness-modified cement needs to be optimised for patient/pathology specific treatment.",eng,0.0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate preoperative MRI scans for such risk factors.
METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed 136 patients (aged 43-93 years; 234 vertebral bodies) with osteoporotic compression fractures. All patients underwent both MRI and PVP. There were 28 men (20.59%) and 108 women (79.41%). Age, gender, bone mineral density (BMD) score, endplate cortical disruption, abnormal T2-weighted hyperintensity in adjacent discs, presence of Kummell's disease, linear body fracture with extension to endplate, level of treated vertebral body and injected cement volume were considered risk factors for intradiscal cement leakage.
RESULTS: Of the 234 vertebral bodies, 55 bodies from 42 patients with no endplate cortical disruption showed no adjacent intradiscal cement leakage. Of 179 bodies from 95 patients with endplate cortical disruption, 54 (30.17%) showed intradiscal cement leakage. Of the other possible risk factors, abnormal T2 hyperintensity in adjacent discs was significantly related to intradiscal cement leakage (P = 0.016). The other possible factors (age, gender, BMD score, Kummell's disease, linear body fracture extending to the endplate, level of treated vertebral body and injected cement volume) were not related to intradiscal cement leakage.
CONCLUSION: There was no adjacent intradiscal cement leakage without endplate cortical disruption. Abnormal T2 hyperintensity in adjacent discs may be related to intradiscal cement leakage, but only in the presence of endplate cortical disruption. Also, not having Kummell's disease did not prevent intradiscal cement leakage. Thus, given these circumstances, careful cement injection is needed to reduce intradiscal cement leakage.

Kim,2006.0,The biomechanical evaluation of calcium phosphate cements for use in vertebroplasty,10.3171/spi.2006.4.2.154,"OBJECT: The authors evaluate the biomechanical properties of vertebral bodies (VBs) stabilized with calcium phosphate (CaP) cements for use in vertebroplasty in comparison with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). METHODS: In the first phase of the study, 73 VBs (T3-L2; thoracic region [T3-8] and thoracolumbar region [T9-L2]) were collected from seven fresh human cadavers. Compression tests were performed before and after vertebroplasty using PMMA (compression strength 80 MPa) and three kinds of CaP cements-CaP1 (5 MPa), CaP2 (20 MPa), and CaP3 (50 MPa). The authors compared the maximal compression loads (MCLs) and stiffness before and after vertebroplasty in each of the four cement groups. In the second phase of the study, 18 paired spinal units (PSUs) were collected from three fresh human cadavers, and the authors injected two types of cement selected from the first phase of the study into the lower level of six PSUs. They compared the MCLs of the untreated and two treated groups (there were six PSUs in each type of group) to analyze the tendency of inducing compression fractures in the upper level of the PSUs. The MCLs of the PMMA-injected vertebrae were significantly increased after vertebroplasty. The MCL levels of the CaP3-injected vertebrae and the CaP2-injected thoracolumbar vertebrae were decreased from those of untreated vertebrae without being significant. The MCLs of CaP1-injected vertebrae and CaP2-injected thoracic vertebrae were significantly decreased after vertebroplasty. The stiffness of all cement groups was decreased after vertebroplasty compared with initial stiffness, significantly so in all three thoracic CaP groups. In the second compression test with PSUs, the MCLs of the CaP2- and CaP3-injected PSUs were not significantly different from those of the untreated control PSUs. CONCLUSIONS: The CaP3-injected vertebrae restored the MCLs of human vertebrae closer to their initial levels than the PMMA-injected vertebrae did. The CaP2- and CaP3-injected PSUs showed no tendency to induce compression fractures in adjacent VBs.",eng,1.0

Lordoplasty has been reported as an alternative, cost-effective, minimally invasive, percutaneous cement augmentation technique with good restoration of vertebral body height and alignment. The authors report on its clinical and radiological midterm results. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of patients treated with lordoplasty from 2002 to 2014. Inclusion criteria were clinical and radiological follow-up evaluations longer than 24 months. Radiographs were accessed regarding initial correction and progressive loss of reduction. Complications and reoperations were recorded. Actual pain level, pain relief immediately after surgery, autonomy, and subjective impression of improvement of posture were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS Sixty-five patients (46 women, 19 men, age range 38.9-86.2 years old) were treated with lordoplasty for 69 vertebral compression and insufficiency fractures. A significant correction of the vertebral kyphotic angle (mean 13 degrees ) and segmental kyphotic angle (mean 11 degrees ) over a mean follow-up of 33 months (range 24-108 months) was achieved (p < 0.001). On average, pain was relieved to 90% of the initial pain level. In 24% of the 65 patients a second spinal intervention was necessary: 16 distant (24.6%) and 7 adjacent (10.8%) new osteoporotic fractures, 4 instrumented stabilizations (6.2%), 1 new adjacent traumatic fracture (1.5%), and 1 distant microsurgical decompression (1.5%). Cement leakage occurred in 10.4% but was only symptomatic in 1 case. CONCLUSIONS Lordoplasty appeared safe and effective in midterm pain alleviation and restoration of kyphotic deformity in osteoporotic compression and insufficiency fractures. The outcomes of lordoplasty are consistent with other augmentation techniques.",eng,0.0

RESULTS: Various studies have shown higher failure rates in osteoporotic patients, most probably due to reduced bone quality and a poor bone-screw interface. Augmentation of pedicle screws with bone cement, such as polymethylmethacrylate or calcium based cements, is one valid option to enhance fixation if required. CONCLUSIONS: Crucial factors for success in the use of augmented screws are careful patient selection, a proper technique and choice of the ideal cement augmentation option.",eng,0.0

Technical note,10.3171/spi.2006.5.5.461,"The authors describe a new vertebroplasty technique for the treatment of chronic painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). A urinary balloon catheter is introduced into the vertebral body (VB) via a bilateral transpedicular approach and inflated with contrast medium to obtain sufficient space for endoscopic observation. The granulation tissue occupying the VB is then removed using a punch or curette inserted through one pedicle, with the guidance of an endoscope introduced through the contralateral pedicle. After endoscopic resection of granulation tissue in the fractured VB, vertebroplasty is performed by injecting calcium phosphate cement (CPC) into the VB. Fourteen patients in whom chronic painful VCFs were diagnosed underwent surgery involving the aforementioned technique. In all cases, intractable pain and ambulatory function improved after surgery, and there were no significant systemic complications. On radiological evaluation in eight cases in which the follow-up period exceeded 1 year, the mean height of the fractured VB improved from 38% of that of adjacent intact VBs to 85%. Although a slight loss of correction was routinely observed at 1 month postoperatively, an additional loss of VB height was not noted up to 1 year later. Bone formation was commonly seen along the anterior wall of the involved vertebrae in all cases. Vertebroplasty involving the endoscopic removal of granulation tissue proved to be an efficacious procedure for the treatment of chronic painful VCFs. The osteoconductive capacity of CPC facilitated callus formation and ultimately restoration of vertebral bone structure.",eng,0.0

Treatment of this condition remains a challenge. Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures can be managed with various approaches, but each has limitations. In this study, we compared the clinical outcomes obtained using short-segment fixation with intravertebral expandable pillars (I-VEP) to those obtained with percutaneous kyphoplasty in patients who had suffered vertebral compression fractures. METHODS: The study included 46 patients with single-level osteoporotic thoracolumbar fractures. Twenty-two patients in Group I underwent short-segment fixation with I-VEP and 24 patients in Group II underwent kyphoplasty. All patients were evaluated pre- and postoperatively using a visual analogue scale, anterior height of the fractured vertebra, and kyphotic angle of the fractured vertebra. The latter 2 radiological parameters were measured at the adjacent segments as well. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of gender or fracture level, but the mean age was greater in Group II patients (p = 0.008). At the 1-year follow-up, there were no significant differences in the visual analogue scale scores, anterior height of the fractured vertebra, or the value representing anterior height above the fractured vertebra and kyphotic angle below the fractured vertebra, after adjusting for the patients' gender, fracture level, and age. When considered separately, the anterior height below the fractured vertebra was significantly higher and the kyphotic angle above the fractured vertebra was significantly smaller in Group I than in Group II (p = 0.029 and p = 0.008, respectively). The kyphotic angle of the fractured vertebra was significantly smaller in Group II than in Group I (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In older individuals with vertebral compression fractures, kyphoplasty restored and maintained the collapsed vertebral body with less kyphotic deformity than that induced by short-segment fixation with I-VEP. Short-segment fixation with I-VEP was more effective in maintaining the integrity of adjacent segments, which prevented the domino effect often observed in patients with osteoporotic kyphotic spines.",eng,0.0

The mainstay of management for symptomatic vertebral compression fractures is targeted medical therapy, including analgesics, bed rest, external fixation, and rehabilitation. However, anti-inflammatory drugs and certain types of analgesics can be poorly tolerated by elderly patients, and surgical fixation often fails due to the poor quality of osteoporotic bone.

The visual analogue scale (VAS), the vertebral height, and the Cobb angle were determined before operation, and at 3 days and 6 months after operation. In group A, there were 6 males and 36 females aged 59-93 years (76.5 years on average) with an average disease duration of 7 days (range, 3 hours to 21 days); 27 segments of thoracic vertebrae and 31 segments of lumbar vertebrae were involved, including 15 segments at mild degree, 38 segments at moderate degree, and 5 segments at severe degree according to degree classification system of compression fractures of Zoarski and Peh. In group B, there were 9 males and 34 females aged 54-82 years (75.3 years on average) with an average disease duration of 7 days (range, 1 hour to 20 days); 26 segments of thoracic vertebrae and 35 segments of lumbar vertebrae were involved, including 21 segments at mild degree, 36 segments at moderate degree, and 4 segments at severe degree according to degree classification system of compression fractures of Zoarski and Peh. There were no significant difference (P > 0.05) in sex, age, affected site, degree, and disease duration between 2 groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in operative time, blood loss, or injected cement volume between 2 groups. No serious complication or death occurred in 2 groups. Cement leakage was observed in 4 cases (9.5%) of group A and in 5 cases (11.6%) of group B. The VAS scores after operation significantly decreased in 2 groups (P < 0.01). At 3 days and 6 months after operation, the VAS scores in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (P < 0.05). The postoperative compression rates of affected vertebral body in 2 groups significantly decreased (P < 0.01). The compression rates of affected vertebral body at 3 days and 6 months after operation, and the height recovery rate at 3 days after operation in group A were superior to those in group B (P < 0.05).

Typically the procedure involves placement of bilateral Sky Bone Expanders in the fractured vertebral body via a transpedicular approach. We describe performance of SKy""phoplasty using the Disc-O-Tech Sky Bone Expander (Disc-O-Tech Medical Technologies, Herzliya, Israel, and Monroe Township, New Jersey) via a unilateral transpedicular approach. The advantage of a unilateral approach is that it reduces the risks associated with large-bore needle placement. These risks include pedicle fracture, medial transgression of the pedicle or transgression into the spinal canal, nerve injury, cement leakage along the cannula tract, and spinal epidural hematoma. Additionally, using a unilateral approach reduces operative time and costs.

There were no significant differences in the improvement of visual analog scale, Cobb angle, anterior height ratio of the injured vertebra between manipulative reduction combined with PKP and simple PKP (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Compared with simple PVP, manipulative reduction combined with PVP may result in more clinical efficacy on the improvement of Cobb angle and anterior ratio of the injured vertebra. And compared with simple PKP, manipulative reduction combined with PKP has no obvious advantages on the improvement of visual analog scale, Cobb angle, anterior height ratio of the injured vertebra. However, the number and quality of the literatures, may resulted in the effect of mistrust, so more large sample and high-quality RCTs are needed in future.",chi,0.0

METHODS: Fifteen patients (24 vertebrae) underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty and 15 (18 vertebrae) received percutaneous kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The postoperative recovery of the anterior vertebral body height, visual analogue scale (VAS) and locomotor activity before and after the operations were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: All the patients were available for the follow-up lasting for 3-15 months (average 7 months). In the vertebroplasty group, the VAS score decreased from 8.68 preoperatively to 1.74 postoperatively and to 1.13 at the final follow-up. The VAS score in the kyphoplasty group decreased from 8.62 preoperatively to 1.72 postoperatively and to 1.21 at the final follow-up. Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty were effective in improving the anterior vertebral body height, but kyphoplasty showed a better effect. None of the patients developed serious complications associated with the operations.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on 195 vertebrae in 142 patients with painful OVCFs treated with vertebroplasty in our hospital from May 2007 to June 2012. The scores of visual analogue scale (VAS) were recorded and the heights of vertebral bodies and Cobb angles were measured in the mid-sagittal plane of the reformatted images at 64-detector row CT during the period of follow-up. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) distribution in vertebrae and whether leakage was observed on CT within 3 days after PVP. The changes in VAS, heights of vertebral bodies and Cobb angles were compared between the cases with and without leakages. RESULTS: The successful rate of technique of PVP was 100%. The mean volume of PMMA injected in each vertebra was (4.5 +/- 1.1) ml and (6.0 +/- 1.2) ml respectively in thoracic and lumbar. The mean follow-up was (17 +/- 6) months. Asymptomatic leakages of PMMA were demonstrated by CT in 38 patients with 43 vertebrae (22.1%). The average decrease in VAS was 5.25 and 1.12 respectively in 24 hours and a month after PVP. The changes in VAS respectively at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and more than 1 year after procedure were not significantly different.In postoperative 3 days, the average increase in height of vertebral body was 1.55 mm anteriorly and 1.38 mm centrally, the average reduction in Cobb angle were 2.37 degrees . The heights and Cobb angles of vertebral bodies between in 3 days and in more than 1 year after PVP were not significantly different. The scores of VAS and the changes in vertebral body heights and Cobb angles between the patients with or without cement leakages were not significantly different during the period of follow-up. CONCLUSION: PVP is an effective treatment for patients with painful OVCFs that provides immediate and sustained pain relief, increases in the heights of vertebral bodies injected in cement and keeps stable radiological progression within at least 1 year after PVP. Asymptomatic cement leakages around vertebrae have no influence on pain relief and vertebral stability in this group of patients.",chi,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the histopathologic findings of 2 retrieved specimens from failed vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty using PMMA cement has been commonly used to treat debilitating back pain from compression fracture, angiomas, and metastatic cancer. However, there was concern about the unpredictable future results with PMMA cement. The histopathologic changes were rarely reported. METHODS: There were 2 PMMA augmented and 3 nonaugmented fractured vertebral bodies retrieved for histopathologic study. Between the 2 groups, we compared the findings of bone necrosis, foreign body reaction, fibrotic wall formation, and neovascularization. RESULTS: Bone necrosis was noted in the periphery of PMMA cement, which was surrounded by fibrotic tissues. In contrast, no fibrotic wall formation could be found in the nonaugmented control group. Foreign body reaction was only noted in PMMA augmented cases, and neovascularization was only noted in the control cases. CONCLUSION: PMMA cement might not be as bioinert as we considered. Therefore, the long-term safety of vertebroplasty should be further evaluated.",eng,0.0

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 148 patients who had undergone PKP or PVP between March 2006 and October 2013 in Peking University People's Hospital was conducted. In the study, 29 patients with 42 refractured vertebra and 119 patients without refracture were included. All the patients were observed for a time of (34.4+/-26.8) months. Clinical, imaging and procedure related factors (gender, age, height, weight, body mass index, the level of the injured vertebra, the time interval between the procedure and the refracture, the level of the refractured vertebra, the bone cement volume injected, performed PKP or PVP,performed unilateral or bilateral, the percentage of anterior vertebral height restoration, the correction of the Cobb angle, cement diffusion, bone mineral density, presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, history of fractures of the whole body, anti-osteoporosis treatment, cement leakage) for each group were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: Of all the patients,16 (55.17%, 16/29) had refractures in the adjacent vertebra, and 13 (44.83%, 13/29) had refractures in the nonadjacent vertebra. Refractures within 3 months accounted for 31.03% (9/29) of all the refractures, and within 1 year accounted for 55.17% (16/29). Both older age (P=0.027, HR=1.051, 95% CI=1.006-1.098) and a history of fractures of the whole body (P=0.012, HR=0.386, 95% CI=0.184-0.812) were statistically significant as the independent risk factors for predicting refractures.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty in hyperextension for osteoporotic Kummell disease. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out on data from downstream balloon kyphoplasty treatments in hyperextension for 18 patients with osteoporotic Kummell disease. All cases were single-segment disease affecting T5 (1 case), T7 (1 case), T8 (2 cases), T11 (6 cases), T12 (4 cases), L1 (2 cases), L2 (1 case), or L4 (1 case). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry bone mineral density values ranged from -2.8 to -5.8 SD. The sagittal Cobb angle of the involved segment was measured before and after the operation and the final follow-up also included a visual analog pain score (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) after comprehensive efficacy assessment. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 12-36 months, with an average of 15.8 months. Patients showed lower back pain relief and improvement in daily life activities. The kyphosis Cobb angle improved from 32.60+/-3.82 degrees before surgery to 7.60+/-1.68 degrees after surgery, and VAS and ODI scores significantly improved from 8.7+/-0.96 points and 88.6+/-3.76% to 2.6+/-0.32 points and 28.6+/-2.67%, respectively.

A meta-analysis,10.1007/s11999-014-3745-0,"BACKGROUND: An osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture is a common condition in elderly people, especially women. The percutaneous kyphoplasty is an effective treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Controversy remains regarding whether a unilateral or a bilateral approach is superior, and to our knowledge, there have been no large studies comparing these two approaches, therefore a meta-analysis synthesizing the data on this question is warranted. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked the following questions: (1) Is there evidence to suggest a benefit in clinical outcome as assessed by the VAS and Oswestry Disability Index of a unilateral kyphoplasty or bilateral kyphoplasties? (2) Are the complications associated with the two approaches different? (3) Do the procedures result in different kyphosis angle reduction or anterior vertebral height restoration? (4) Is the surgical time for the procedures different? METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge MEDLINE (January 1980 to June 2013), and reference lists of eligible prospective studies. The levels of the evidence and recommendations were assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system. Five studies encompassing 253 patients met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The short- and long-term clinical outcomes as assessed by the VAS and Oswestry Disability Index showed no differences between unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasties (p = 0.41, p = 0.60 for VAS; p = 0.10, p = 0.36 for Oswestry Disability Index). There were no differences in complications such as cement leakage and adjacent vertebral fractures associated with the two approaches (p = 0.43 and p = 0.95). The kyphosis angle reduction and anterior vertebral height restoration showed no difference between the two approaches (p = 0.34 and p = 0.46). The unilateral approach was shorter in terms of surgical time (mean difference, -24.98; p < 0.0001). The overall GRADE system evidence quality was very low, with only high evidence for operation time, which lessens our confidence in recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral and bilateral percutaneous kyphoplasties appear to be safe and effective for treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. No clinically important differences were found between them. Considering less operation time and less cost, we suggest that a unilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty is advantageous, but because of the poor quality of the evidence, high-quality randomized controlled trials are required to resolve this issue.",eng,0.0

PURPOSE: This analysis reports on the 1 year results of patients after BKP treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multicenter observational case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: The data on 625 cases with 819 treated vertebrae were documented from March 2005 to May 2012. OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgeon-administered outcome instruments were primary intervention form for BKP and the follow-up form; patient self-reported measures were EuroQol-5D questionnaire, North American Spine Society outcome instrument /Core Outcome Measures Index (including visual analog scale), and a comorbidity questionnaire. Outcome measures were back pain, medication, quality of life (QoL), cement extrusions, and new fractures within the first postoperative year. METHODS: Data were recorded preoperatively and at 3 to 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison of pre- with postoperative measurements. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors with a significant influence on the outcome. RESULTS: Seventy percent of patients were women with mean age of 71 years (range, 18-91 years); mean age of men was 65 years (range, 15-93 years).

To our knowledge no study has been published reporting the treatment of acute high energy post-traumatic fracture (mainly single burst fracture) by vertebroplasty. Our purpose was to evaluate the technical feasibility of the cement injection at this acute phase, assess its the impact on the pain and monitor spinal stability, by quantifying potential kyphosis modification. Twelve patients with relative contraindication of the orthopaedic treatment were treated by early injection after the trauma for an A type fracture of the Magerl classification, without neurological sign. Patients surveys revealed a significant pain reduction within the first day. Half of them reduced the kyphosis angle, and the anterior height vertebral body significantly improved after the vertebroplasty. The mean reduction in the kyphosis angle was 8. No complication occurred except one extravertebral asymptomatic leak, with secondary increase of the kyphosis. Vertebroplasty performed in reduction position may allow a complete stabilization without pain and furthermore can reduce the kyphosis angle.",eng,1.0

METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent CBCT-guided unipedicular spinal augmentation procedures between 1 January 2012 and 15 June 2015 was performed. 59 patients (43 females 16 males; mean-age, 74.0 years; range, 52-90 years) underwent unipedicular spinal augmentation in 78 vertebral levels (T5-T9, n = 14; T10-L2, n = 42; L3-L5, n = 22). Degree of cross-over in contralateral hemivertebral body, complications and 30-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS: 97% (76/78) of procedures were technically successful. Two procedures failed owing to vertebral sclerosis. For vertebroplasty, all cases (6/6) demonstrated cross-over filling of cement and 50% (3/6) showed cement cross-over >50% of contralateral half of the vertebral body. For kyphoplasty, 13 out of 15 procedures demonstrated balloon and cement cross-over >50% of contralateral half of the vertebral body. Two kyphoplasty procedures required the second pedicle after midline cross-over of cement failed. Of the kyphoplasty procedures that were successfully performed with the unipedicular approach, 76.9% (10/13) showed cement cross-over >50% of contralateral half of the vertebral body. For stentoplasty, all cases (55/55) showed midline stent-cement complex cross-over and 78.2% (43/55) exhibited stent-cement complex cross-over >50% of contralateral half of the vertebral body. There was no major complication or mortality. Minor complications included asymptomatic cement extravasation (6.4%, n = 5) and self-limiting haematoma (1.3%, n = 1). CONCLUSION: Unipedicular access for spinal augmentation procedures is achieved at a high success rate with the use of CBCT.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty using the data presented in published clinical studies, with respect to patient pain relief, restoration of mobility and vertebral body height, complication rate, and incidence of new adjacent vertebral fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been gaining popularity for treating vertebral fractures. Current reviews provide an overview of the procedures but are not comprehensive and tend to rely heavily on personal experience. This article aimed to compile all available data and evaluate the clinical outcome of the 2 procedures. METHODS: This is a systematic review of all the available data presented in peer-reviewed published clinical trials. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated, and data were collected targeting specific standard measurements. Where possible, a quantitative aggregation of the data was performed. RESULTS: A large proportion of subjects had some pain relief, including 87% with vertebroplasty and 92% with kyphoplasty. Vertebral height restoration was possible using kyphoplasty (average 6.6 degrees ) and for a subset of patients using vertebroplasty (average 6.6 degrees ). Cement leaks occurred for 41% and 9% of treated vertebrae for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, respectively. New fractures of adjacent vertebrae occurred for both procedures at rates that are higher than the general osteoporotic population but approximately equivalent to the general osteoporotic population that had a previous vertebral fracture. CONCLUSIONS: The problem with stating definitely that vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are safe and effective procedures is the lack of comparative, blinded, randomized clinical trials. Standardized evaluative methods should be adopted.",eng,1.0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed and collected data from the medical records of 507 patients with osteoporosis who were treated at Mayo Clinic's site in Rochester, MN, from July 1, 1998, through August 31, 2005. Patients older than 55 years with at least 1 radiographically confirmed nontraumatic vertebral compression fracture (VCF) were identified, and those with evidence of secondary osteoporosis, traumatically induced VCF, long-term oral corticosteroid use, or bone malignancy were excluded. The remaining 57 patients were categorized into 3 groups: those receiving treatment with ROPE only (n=20), PVP only (n=20), or both PVP and ROPE (n=17). The end point was the refracture date or date of the last recorded follow-up if no refracture occurred. Statistical analysis of time-to-recurrence data was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test (P less than .05). RESULTS: The median time before refracture for patients treated with PVP was 4.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]), 1.4-9.3 months; for patients treated with ROPE only, 60.4 months (95% CI, 27.6 months-upper limit undefined); and for patients treated with PVP-ROPE, 20.4 months (95% CI, 2.8 months-upper limit undefined) (P <001).

Vertebral augmentation procedures are popular treatment options for stability and pain relief. Preliminary studies have suggested that such procedures are adequately efficacious. However, the first randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2009 showed that these procedures were not significantly different than placebo with regards to pain relief and quality of life. These studies were met with considerable criticism. The matter was further complicated when The Lancet published an RCT of its own that demonstrated the superiority of vertebroplasty over conservative management. The conflicting evidence has sparked ongoing debate in the medical community. All sides have provided arguments supported by evidence of varying strength and validity. OBJECTIVE: To provide a concise and comprehensive presentation of the controversy surrounding vertebral augmentation procedures and the evidence cited by proponents on both sides of the debate. METHODS: We began by researching the major randomized controlled trials both for and against vertebroplasty. These articles were already known to us, and were used as a starting point. We then performed a literature search in PubMed for articles dated from 2000 through 2012. The bibliographies of major articles and reviews were also cross-referenced for additional sources. RESULTS: A number of articles that included comprehensive and systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and commentaries about noted studies were found. These provided a broad, detailed overview of the subject. Many of the common themes of these articles included limitations in the design, methods, and patient selection with regard to the RCTs and other available studies. LIMITATIONS: This review does not analyze the quality of evidence available nor does it provide an opinion in this regard. The conclusions of the present article are, therefore, general and descriptive in nature. CONCLUSIONS: The arguments presented by proponents of both sides of the debate appear to have validity. All of the major studies cited as evidence for or against vertebral augmentation procedures have limitations in their quality. Consequently, the debate cannot be concluded, convincingly, until more elaborate studies are conducted involving larger numbers of patients with clear procedure methods agreed upon by the major authorities in the field.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,M. A. Hussein,2007.0,Multiple myeloma: most common end-organ damage and management,", ","End-organ damage is the factor that differentiates plasma cell dyscrasia requiring therapy (active multiple myeloma [MM]) from disease that does not require therapy (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering [asymptomatic] MM). Progressive skeletal destruction is the hallmark of MM and responsible for principle morbidity in the disease. The spine is the most afflicted skeletal organ, and vertebral fractures have significantly contributed to its poor prognosis. Early mortality in MM is usually attributed to the combined effects of active disease and comorbid factors. Infection and renal failure are the main direct causes of early mortality. Using bisphosphonates to manage skeletal events mainly by preventing or slowing the destructive process has become an important adjunctive treatment in MM. Advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, offer these patients less-invasive options for treating vertebral collapse and restoring function. The aggressive management of other complications of the disease through more effective and less toxic therapy that targets the primary disease, in addition to supportive care, is resulting in patients experiencing less morbidity and probably lower mortality. This article reviews recent advances in the understanding of bone disease in MM, the role of bisphosphonates in preventing skeletal events, and available data on percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, and discusses the management of infection and renal failure, which seem to be responsible for high initial mortality and thereby compromise the current advances in therapy.",eng,1.0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility of CT- and fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous vertebroplasty in the treatment of vertebral split fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this study. Sixty-two consecutive adult patients who had post-traumatic vertebral split fractures (A2 according to the AO classification) without neurological symptoms were prospectively treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. All these procedures were performed by an interventional radiologist under computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy guidance by using only local anaesthesia. Postoperative outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores. RESULTS: Vertebroplasty was performed on thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, creating a cement bridge between the displaced fragment and the rest of the vertebral body. Seven discal cement leakages (11%) were observed, without occurrence of adjacent vertebral compression fractures. The mean VAS measurements +/- standard deviation (SD) significantly decreased from 7.9 +/- 1.5 preoperatively to 3.3 +/- 2.1 at 1 day, 2.2 +/- 2.0 at 1 month, and 1.8 +/- 1.4 at 6 months (P<0.001). The mean ODI scores +/- SD had also a significant improvement: 62.3 +/- 17.2 preoperatively and 15.1 +/- 6.0 at the 6-month follow-up (P<0.001).

Patients are often fragile. Imaging allows safe guidance to create mini-invasive"" procedures under adequate anesthesia. Patients' selection is important. If the goal is pain relief, cementoplasty provides a very effective bone consolidation and pain control. Simple and low-risk, vertebroplasty is the technique of choice in case of lytic bone metastases with spinal fracture risk or after failure of analgesic radiotherapy. If the medical project is curative, the tumor ablation procedures are realised through thermic or embolic techniques. After 60 degrees C, the heat induces a coagulative necrose. Under -20 degrees C, the cold leads to destroy the tissues. The major advantage of the cryotherapy is the predictibility of the ablation zone due to the well-visualized ice ball on perprocedural images. This technique is much more adapted to spare the nervous structures closed to the metastasis. The development of these new techniques of IR will treat bone metastases earlier, sometimes asymptomatic and thus improves the quality of life in patients with bone metastases.""",fre,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 169 patients who were referred to the radiology department of our institution for PVP between January 2011 and December 2014 were retrospectively evaluated. The effectiveness of FJI was evaluated by the proportion of patients who cancelled PVP and who experienced reduced pain. In addition, by means of medical chart and MRI review, those clinical factors (age, sex, history of trauma, amount of injected steroids and interval days elapsed between VCF and FJI) and MR image factors (kyphosis angle, height loss, single or multiple level of VCF, burst fracture, central canal compromise, posterior element injury) that were believed to be significant for the effectiveness of FJI were statistically analysed. RESULTS: In the 26 patients with FJI prior to PVP, six (23%) patients cancelled PVP with considerable improvement in reported pain. In the 20 patients with PVP after FJI, improvement in pain after FJI was reported by six patients, resulting in a total of 12 patients (46%) who experienced reduced pain after FJI. Clinical factors and MR image factors did not show any statistically significant difference between those groups, divided by PVP cancellation and by improvement of pain. CONCLUSION: After FJI prior to PVP, about one quarter of patients cancelled PVP due to reduced pain and overall about half of the patients experienced reduced pain.",eng,0.0

A 74-year-old woman started to experience low-back pain following a rear-end car collision. Plain radiography showed diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). Sagittal CT sections revealed a transverse fracture of the L-4 vertebral body with a bone defect. Sagittal fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI revealed a flow void in the fractured vertebra. Spinal angiography revealed an intraosseous AVF with a feeder from the right L-4 segmental artery. A fresh fracture of the L-4 vertebral body with a spinal intraosseous AVF was diagnosed. Observation of a flow void in the vertebral body on fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI was important for the diagnosis of the spinal intraosseous AVF. Because conservative treatment was ineffective, surgery was undertaken. The day before surgery, embolization through the right L-4 segmental artery was performed using 2 coils to achieve AVF closure. Posterolateral fusion with instrumentation at the T12-S2 vertebral levels was performed without L-4 vertebroplasty. The spinal intraosseous AVF had disappeared after 4 months. At 24 months after surgery, the bone defect was completely replaced by bone and the patient experienced no limitations in daily activities. Given their experience with the present case, the authors believe that performing vertebroplasty or anterior reconstruction may not be necessary in treating spinal intraosseous AVF.",eng,0.0

Conservative treatment in the form of bed rest, pain control and bracing may create a vicious circle, in which reduced activity leads to further reduction in bone density and fracture risk. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is an accepted treatment modality for osteoporotic vertebral body collapse present for less than 1 year, vertebral myeloma, haemangioma, metastasis and recent traumatic fractures (between 3 and 12 months). We describe an osteoporotic patient in whom successful PVP was performed, under general anaesthesia using CT and fluoroscopic guidance, in a post-traumatic 5-year-old VCF with complete alleviation of debilitating pain. In the light of our experience, we suggest that PVP should be carried out in a series of similar patients to asses its value as a treatment option in patients with chronic osteoporotic vertebral fractures for pain relief and improvement in mobility, independent of fracture age.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Eight men and 28 women aged 61 to 99 (mean, 80) years with osteoporotic vertebral fractures underwent percutaneous transpedicular vertebroplasty using CPC. During the same period, 6 men and 32 women aged 53 to 93 (mean, 77) years underwent conservative treatment. The indication for vertebroplasty was a painful unstable fracture, with mobility of the vertebral body shown on flexion and extension lateral radiographs. Fractures without mobility despite deformity were treated conservatively. RESULTS: In the vertebroplasty group, all patients benefited from reduced back pain immediately after surgery, and pain relief was maintained at the latest follow-up. However, correction loss continued until one month after the operation. The mean visual analogue score for pain decreased significantly from preoperation to one day after surgery (9.3 vs. 6.2, p=0.02), and further decreased to 2.8 (p = 0.04) on day 3 or 4 when ambulation began, and to 1.5 at the one month follow-up and 1.4 at the final follow-up (mean, 14 months). The mean duration of analgesic treatment was significantly shorter in the vertebroplasty than conservatively treated group (10.2 vs. 63.5 days). All patients in the vertebroplasty group achieved bone union, with no adjacent vertebral fractures. However, in patients having conservative treatment, there were 2 adjacent vertebral fractures and 4 pseudarthroses, and the collapse continued for several months. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous transpedicular vertebroplasty using CPC achieves immediate pain relief and reduces the risk of vertebral body collapse and pseudarthrosis among elderly patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.",eng,0.0

However, we also noted the findings in many patients with osteoporosis and hypothesized that it is not specific for malignant lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of pedicle involvement in painful osteoporotic compression fractures and to determine whether the sign is specific for malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MR images and CT scans of 152 patients who underwent PV for painful compression fractures. There were 140 patients (225 vertebrae) with osteoporotic fractures and 12 patients (19 vertebrae) with malignant fractures. Three radiologists evaluated the degree and extent of signal-intensity changes of the pedicle on MR imaging by consensus. The CT findings were also evaluated. The chi(2) test was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Of the 225 vertebrae of osteoporotic fractures and 19 vertebrae of malignant fractures, pedicle involvement on MR imaging was seen in 144 (64%) and 16 (84.2%) vertebrae, respectively, and there was no statistically significant difference (P = .065). Positive pedicle involvement in osteoporotic fractures was seen in 84 (77%) of 109 vertebrae with early-phase fractures (< or =3 months) and 60 (51.7%) of 116 vertebrae with chronic-phase fractures (>3 months), and this was statistically significant (P < .001). Among 144 osteoporotic vertebrae that showed positive pedicle involvement on MR imaging, 45 (31%) showed pedicle fractures and 55 (38.2%) showed sclerotic change on CT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 115 patients (88 women, 27 men; mean age, 77.1 years) who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty for a single-level compression fracture within 7 days of preprocedural MRI were enrolled. Two radiologists evaluated preprocedural unenhanced MRI (T1-weighted and STIR) and CE-MRI examinations for intravertebral clefts on separate days by consensus. The time from the onset of fracture to MRI was classified into three groups: early phase fractures (< 1 month), late phase fractures (1-3 months), and chronic phase fractures (>/= 3 months). The cement distribution during percutaneous vertebroplasty was used as a reference standard, and detectability of clefts was compared between unenhanced MRI and CE-MRI in relation to the time frame. An analog of the McNemar test was used for analyses. RESULTS: There were 104 patients (90.4%) with and 11 patients (9.6%) without a cleft. The sensitivities of unenhanced MRI and CE-MRI, respectively, for detecting clefts were 60.9% and 91.3% for early phase fractures (p = 0.02); 78.6% and 100% for late phase fractures (p = 0.014); and 92.5% and 94.3% for chronic phase fractures (p = 0.3).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standard Medicare 5% anonymized inpatient files (1999-2009) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a diagnosis of vertebral fracture without spinal cord injury and primary or metastatic bony malignancy were divided into percutaneous or surgical groups based on whether they received vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty or surgical treatment. Patients who had no intervention or both interventions were excluded. Cost, length of stay, and type of discharge were examined while controlling for demographic and comorbidity variables. RESULTS: A total of 451 patients were included; 52% received percutaneous treatment and 48% received surgery. Patients treated percutaneously were older (P < .001) and more likely to be female (P = .04). Percutaneous therapy predicted $14,862 less Medicare cost and $13,565 less overall cost (P < .001 for both), and 4.1 fewer inpatient days (P < .001). Patients who underwent surgery had higher odds of death (odds ratio = 3.38, P = .016), discharge to a rehabilitation facility (odds ratio = 3.3, P = .003), and transfer to another inpatient facility (odds ratio = 8.53, P < .001), and lower odds of discharge to home (odds ratio = 0.42, P < .001) and hospice (odds ratio = 0.08, P = .002).

This study aimed at (1) conducting a retrospective multicenter study to survey surgical treatments performed at referral center hospitals in various regions in Japan and (2) analyzing situations and problems related to the surgical treatments of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in Japanese hospitals. METHODS: Among 738 patients who were hospitalized in 13 hospitals in various regions in Japan between 2005 and 2006 for osteoporotic vertebral fractures, 84 patients (11.4%) who underwent spinal surgery were enrolled. These patients were retrospectively analyzed regarding cause of injury, preoperative symptoms, preoperative neurological function, surgical procedures, periods of bed rest, length of hospital stay, and ambulatory status at discharge from hospital. RESULTS: As to the cause of spinal fracture, 38 patients (45% of the surgical patients) could not identify a specific cause of their spinal fracture. Preoperative neurological motor weakness in legs was observed in 41 (49%).

We assessed pain relief, vertebral height restoration, and kyphosis correction following vertebral augmentation using a novel expandable titanium stent implant in cancer patients with painful vertebral compression fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients >18 years of age with metastatic disease who presented symptomatic compression fractures of vertebral bodies T5-L5, with or without a history of osteoporosis, were included in the study. Back pain at presentation, immediately after vertebral stenting, and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up was estimated using the visual analog scale (VAS). Vertebral height and local kyphotic angle (alpha angle) were measured on lateral standing X-ray before and 1-3 months after stenting. RESULTS: Forty-one cancer patients with painful vertebral compression fractures underwent vertebral stenting procedures at 55 levels. There was no perioperative mortality and no significant complication. Median preoperative VAS was 8.0 (range 8-10), falling to 2.0 immediately postop (range 1-6, P = 0.000) and 0 at all subsequent follow-up (P </= 0.012).

The preponderance of evidence has shown that vertebral augmentation provides significant and sustained clinical benefit for patients with VCF. The debate raised by studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine comparing VP with a sham procedure highlights the importance of very careful patient selection for vertebral augmentation procedures, since osteoporotic VCF is usually a self-limiting condition. However, vertebral augmentation may be beneficial in patients with comorbidities that make prolonged bed rest dangerous, in patients with fractures that fail to heal, and in patients with painful VCF due to metastatic disease. Patient selection should be based on a combination of clinical and radiological indications.

OBJECTIVE: To report a patient with spinal tuberculosis (TB) and paravertebral abscess formation after kyphoplasty of L1. The literature is reviewed, and diagnostic options are discussed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Kyphoplasty is a well-established procedure in the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures and metastatic tumors of the vertebrae. Although complication rates are low, there is evidence for an increased risk of serious local infections after kyphoplasty in patients with any history of systemic infection. Spinal TB accounts for 2% of all TB cases with a trend toward an increased incidence in parallel with the growing number of immunocompromised patients. To our knowledge, only 1 article had reported a patient suffering from Pott disease after vertebroplasty. METHODS: A 70-year-old patient with compression fracture of L1 underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty using polymethyl methacrylate. RESULTS: Two weeks after kyphoplasty, the patient was readmitted with backache and signs of acute infection. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of spondylitis with paravertebral abscess formation. A tissue specimen obtained by computed tomography-guided percutaneous biopsy did not yield any pathogen. As broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy failed, combined surgery consisting of posterior instrumentation of Th11-L3 and anterior debridement, corporectomy of L1, and interposition of a titanium mesh cage filled with autologous rib graft was performed. Histologic examination of resected tissue and PCR and culture results confirmed diagnosis of spinal TB. Despite adequate antibiotic treatment and local surgical interventions, the patient died from septic multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: Indication for kyphoplasty in patients with any history of local or systemic infection should be scrutinized rigorously. Symptoms of spinal TB are often nonspecific, and the clinician should be aware of this entity. Active investigation including microbiological and histologic examination is of utmost importance to avoid any delay in correct diagnosis and specific treatment.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To compare the patients radiation exposure and operation time in a balloon kyphoplasty procedure with and without using a navigation system for the placement of working needles. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimal invasive spine surgery is associated with high radiation exposure for both the patient and the surgeon. The use of computer navigation has led to a reduced radiation exposure in experimental trials. To our knowledge, there is no clinical data determining the influence of computer navigation on radiation exposure and operation time in a balloon kyphoplasty procedure. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with 30 osteoporotic vertebra fractures were treated with a computer-navigated kyphoplasty. The placement of the working needles in thoracic spine fractures was performed after acquiring an intraoperative three-dimensional data set. Fractures of the lumbar spine were treated using fluoroscopic three-dimensional navigation. During each procedure the operation time, the overall radiation time, and the DAP were documented. The data of the navigated operations were compared to a control group of consisting of 30 conventional balloon kyphoplasty procedures. RESULTS: In the conventional kyphoplasty group the average operation times for thoracic spine (ts) and lumbar spine (ls) were 61 and 57 minutes, respectively. The average radiation times were 175 and 165 seconds. The DAP applied to the patient was 1972 and 2105 cGy cm. The average operation times in the navigated group were 67 minutes in the ts and 62 minutes in the ls. The average radiation time was reduced significantly in the navigated group (99 seconds ts and 74 seconds ls). The DAP applied to the patient was also significantly lower (1245 cGy cm (ts) and 1318 cGy cm (ls)). CONCLUSION: The use of computer navigation systems in balloon kyphoplasty procedures reduces the radiation exposure of patients and surgeons significantly. The increased technical effort did not lead to a significant longer operation time. Hence, the use of computer navigation systems in balloon kyphoplasty procedures is recommended.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of PVP in the treatment of spinal instability associated with avascular necrosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Two radiologic features of avascular necrosis of a vertebral body are intravertebral vacuum phenomenon and fluid collection, combined with a collapsed vertebra. These can sometimes result in dynamic instability due to intravertebral pseudarthrosis. A treatment for this instability, associated with avascular necrosis, has not been established. METHOD: Sixteen patients with instability, associated with avascular necrosis of a vertebral body, were treated by PVP. The indicators of the condition included spinal instability associated with avascular necrosis, which was diagnosed by a vacuum phenomenon or by fluid collection in the vertebral body as found from imaging studies. The instability of the vertebral body was confirmed from the dynamic lateral view in both flexion and extension. The anterior body height and kyphotic angle changes between pre- and post-treatment were measured on a lateral radiograph. Plain radiography was used during the follow-up period (8-14 months; mean, 11 months) to assess the vertebral column stability. The pain level of each patient was assessed, both before and after the procedure, using a visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 to 10. Marked or complete pain relief was achieved in eight (50%) patients, and moderate pain relief in six (38%), with the immediate postoperative average pain score reduced from 9.0 to 4.3. The mean corrected angle and vertebral height between pre- and post-treatment were 8.5 degrees and 7.0 mm (P =0.001), respectively. There was no significant change in the kyphotic angle of the treated level during the follow-up period (P =0.711). CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a reasonable procedure for the treatment of spinal instability associated with avascular necrosis, but not that caused by an infection. PVP was found to be a minimally invasive and effective procedure that provides pain relief and stabilization of spinal instability associated with noninfected avascular necrosis of the vertebral body.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: To report on three cases of pulmonary embolism caused by polymethylmethacrylate after percutaneous vertebroplasty, and to review the literature briefly for reduction of this complication. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pulmonary embolus caused by polymethylmethacrylate during percutaneous vertebroplasty is a rare complication. However, there is always a potential risk of this complication, which may result in pulmonary infarction. METHODS: Three of 27 patients with malignant spinal tumor experienced pulmonary embolism caused by polymethylmethacrylate after percutaneous vertebroplasty. Cement migration into the venous channel was observed in two patients, but not during the procedure. Two patients had mild dyspnea and chest discomfort, and one was asymptomatic. Pulmonary embolism was confirmed on chest radiographs. Ventilation perfusion scanning was performed to detect perfusion defect in all cases. RESULTS: Ventilation perfusion scanning showed no perfusion defects in any case. The symptoms of dyspnea and chest discomfort in two patients subsided after treatment using supplemental oxygen inhalation and anticoagulants. CONCLUSIONS: Three cases of pulmonary embolism caused by polymethylmethacrylate after percutaneous vertebroplasty are reported. Proper techniques can minimize the risk of pulmonary embolism caused by poly-methylmethacrylate during percutaneous vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

Pflugmacher,2013.0,[Radiofrequency kyphoplasty combined with posterior fixation in the treatment of burst fractures],10.1055/s-0033-1351062,"PURPOSE: Radiofrequency kyphoplasty is an advancement of the balloon kyphoplasty and offers comparable results with a shorter operation time and a lower risk of cement leakage. This prospective study investigates the outcome of radiofrequency kyphoplasty in combination with posterior fixation by a cement-augmented screw system. Accordingly, statistical analyses of the treatment data were performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 19 patients (mean age: 74.5 +/- 7.2 years) with osteoporotic vertebral burst fractures were included in the study. All of them required a surgical intervention for treating the fracture. Thereby, the vertebrae were augmented by radiofrequency kyphoplasty and a posterior fixation by cement-augmentable screws was performed. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the procedure, pain was measured with the visual analog scale (VAS) and functional impairment was analysed by measuring the Oswestry disability index (ODI). Furthermore, a radiographic analysis of the anterior and medial height of the vertebrae and the degree of kyphosis were undertaken. All data were recorded preoperatively, 3 to 4 days postoperatively, 3 months postoperatively and 6 months postoperatively and any additionally occurring cement leakage was documented. RESULTS: The treatment showed a significant reduction of pain and improvement of the functional impairment at the 3 to 4 days postoperative evaluation (pVAS < 0.001, pODI < 0.001). The further follow-ups demonstrated an ongoing improvement of the VAS and ODI from each measurement to the next (pVAS_post-3 M < 0.001, pVAS_3 M-6 M = 0.17, pODI_post-3 M < 0.001, pODI_3 M-6 M = 0.004). The height of the vertebrae was significantly improved after the surgery (p_anterior < 0.001, p_medial < 0.001) and reduced slightly from follow-up to follow-up, but still remained higher than the preoperative value. The degree of kyphosis was also significantly improved after the surgery (p < 0.001), whereby a significant deterioration was shown at the following examinations (p_post-3 M = 0.023, p_3 M-6 M = 0.016). But even as the height decreased the degree of kyphosis was still improved in relation to the preoperative values. During the surgery cement leakage occurred in 3 cases (15.79 %). CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency kyphoplasty is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in combination with the use of posterior fixation by cement-augmentable screws with an acceptable rate of cement leakage.",ger,0.0

We describe a readily identifiable fluoroscopic landmark that facilitates needle placement and validate this with virtual needle placement by using CT data and fluoroscopically guided treatment in 13 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From CTs of 100 consecutive patients, the optimal target zone for needle placement in the sacral ala was defined at the intersection of lines from each of the corners of the first sacral segment, which is readily identifiable on lateral fluoroscopy. We then measured the distance from that virtual target point to the anterior sacral cortex by using the CT data for 3 specific trajectories: 1) parallel to the L5-S1 disk, 2) axial with respect to the patient, and 3) along the long axis of the sacrum. Case records of 13 consecutive patients treated by using this technique were also reviewed. RESULTS: The mean distances for the 3 trajectories were 11.3 mm, 11.2 mm, and 12.8 mm, respectively. Needle placement would have been outside the anterior sacral cortex in 3 patients. Review of preprocedure imaging easily identified this potential breach. During treatment, needle placement by using the landmark was successful in all patients, and there were no complications. CONCLUSIONS: A safe target for sacroplasty needle placement in the superolateral sacral ala can be defined by using the intersection of lines drawn from the corners of the first sacral segment. We validated this landmark by using it for treatment in 13 patients. Further studies evaluating clinical outcomes following sacroplasty will be necessary.",eng,0.0

The technique consists of the percutaneous puncture of the affected vertebral body, followed by injection of an acrylic polymer to provide bone augmentation and prevent further collapse. The internal casting"" of the trabecular microfractures results in pain relief and vertebral consolidation. Vertebroplasty was quickly adopted for use in metastatic vertebral lesions and hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma. The major experience with malignant disease has remained primarily in the European realm; in the United States vertebroplasty is used mainly for the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures. The reasons underlying this divergence in practice experiences remains unclear, although the explosion of vertebroplasty in the U.S. appears to be driven by an assertive, motivated and well-informed elderly population. In addition, malignant lesions are often challenging and practitioners may shy away from these clinically and technically more difficult patients.

However physicians sometimes have problems of high pressure in cement delivery and cement leakage when using Jamshidi(R) needle (JN). Bone void filler (BVF) has larger lumen which may possibly diminish these problems. This study aims to compare the radiologic and clinical outcome of JN and BVF for PVP. METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight patients were treated with PVP for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (VCF) where 46 patients underwent PVP with JN needle and 82 patients with BVF. Radiologic outcome such as kyphotic angle and vertebral body height (VBH) and clinical outcome such as visual analog scale (VAS) scores were measured after treatment in both groups. RESULTS: In JN PVP group, mean of 3.26 cc of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) were injected and 4.07 cc in BVF PVP group (p<0.001). For radiologic outcome, no significant difference in kyphotic angle reduction was observed between two groups. Cement leakage developed in 6 patients using JN PVP group and 2 patients using BVF group (p=0.025). No significant difference in improvement of VAS score was observed between JN and BVF PVP groups (p=0.43). CONCLUSION: For the treatment of osteoporotic VCF, usage of BVF for PVP may increase injected volume of cement, easily control the depth and direction of PMMA which may reduce cement leakage. However, improvement of VAS score did not show difference between two groups. Usage of BVF for PVP may be an alternative to JN PVP in selected cases.",eng,1.0

Although cement leakage is a well-known complication of the procedure, delayed displacement of the injected bone cement material, occurring several weeks after kyphoplasty, is a rare occurrence. In this report, we describe a case of delayed dislodgement of the bone cement occurring 4 weeks after successful kyphoplasty for an osteoporotic compression fracture of L4. CASE REPORT: A balloon kyphoplasty was successfully performed for the clinical management of an osteoporotic compression fracture of the L4 vertebral body in a 74-year-old patient with Kummel disease. However, further progression of the collapse of L4 vertebra was identified on radiographic imaging obtained 4 weeks after the kyphoplasty. A cystic filling pattern of the bone cement was observed, rather than the expected matrix-like pattern, which contributed to the continued progression of the collapse of the vertebral body. CONCLUSIONS: As delayed displacement of bone cement can result in progression of an osteoporotic compression fracture of the vertebrae, we propose that sufficient penetration of bone cement into the microstructure of the trabecular bone of the vertebral body during kyphoplasty could reduce the risk of this phenomenon.",eng,0.0

Current literature results regarding the effect of intradiscal extravasation of cement on the risk of ALF is conflicting with about half of the studies concluding there is no added risk with endplate extravasation and half of the studies reporting opposite conclusions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to further stratify the data to determine whether specifically the location and extent of endplate cement extravasation more strongly affect ALF risk in osteoporotic patients following either VP or balloon KP. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University teaching hospital. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-six cemented levels in 80 patients, treated at a single center between 2008 and 2012 were reviewed. Age, gender, T-score, body mass index, and osteoporosis type (primary or secondary) were recorded. An ALF was defined as a fracture: 1) in a non-cemented vertebra; 2) adjacent to a cemented level; and 3) not due to trauma or malignancy. Location of the cement extravasation (anterior, middle, or posterior third of the vertebral body) and extravasation extent (percentage of the intervertebral disc height occupied by the bolus) were measured. A logistic modeling strategy permitted examining the association between the location and extent of extravasation and the odds of ALF. RESULTS: ALF occurred in 14 of the 52 patients (27%) and 20 of the 98 levels (20.4%) remaining after exclusions. Odds of ALF were 5.9 times higher (95% CI: 1.6 to 21.2, P = 0.008) with extravasation when compared to no leakage. Odds of ALF in a given patient were 22.6 times higher (95% CI: 3.0 to 170.9, P = 0.003) with anterior extravasation when compared to no leakage. Leakage in the middle or posterior thirds and extent of extravasation were not associated with ALF. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of the study include the retrospective study design and small sample size as well as the retrospective implementation of follow-up criteria posing risk of selection bias.

Two patient groups were analyzed: (1) 147 cancer patients with either osteoporotic or malignant vertebral compression fractures (all compression fractures (ACFs)) and (2) 102 cases with documented metastatic compression fractures (MCFs). Univariate and multivariate analyses determined outcomes. RESULTS: 93% of MCFs and 88.5% of ACFs showed response to treatment (pain improvement or resolution): 30% of ACFs and 31% of MCFs experienced pain resolution. MCFs showed increasing age to be a predictor of response to treatment in univariate (OR=1.79, p=0.04) and multivariate (OR=2.05, p=0.03) analysis.

Univariate and multivariate analyses determined outcomes. RESULTS: Four-hundred and sixty-seven patients (89%) showed a response to treatment: 40% had pain resolution and 49% had pain improvement. Multivariate analysis showed that women and older patients had greater odds of being responders (odds ratios [ORs], 0.56 and 0.98, respectively; P = .016 and P = .048, respectively). Patients without cancer (OR, 1.60; P = .012) and women (OR, 2.05; P = .0002) were more likely to experience pain resolution. Increasing numbers of levels treated per case were associated with decreased odds of pain resolution (OR, 0.69; P = .0081). Sex and number of levels treated were independently predictive of pain scale outcomes (ORs, 2.0 and 0.71, respectively; P = .0003 and P = .015).

The purpose of our study was to (i) investigate the occurrence of new fractures in sandwich vertebra after cement augmentation procedures and to (ii) evaluate the clinical outcomes after prophylactic vertebral reinforcement applied with resorbable bone cement. From June 2011 to 2014, we analysed 55 patients with at least one sandwich vertebrae and treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty. Eighteen patients were treated by prophylactic vertebroplasty with a resorbable bone cement to strengthen the sandwich vertebrae as the prevention group. The others were the non-prevention group. All patients were examined by spinal radiographs within 1 day, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and thereafter. The incidence of sandwich vertebra is 8.25% (55/667) in our study. Most sandwich vertebrae (69.01%, 49/71) are distributed in the thoracic-lumbar junction. There are 24 sandwich vertebrae (18 patients) and 47 sandwich vertebrae (37 patients) in either prevention group or non-prevention group, respectively. No significant difference is found between age, sex, body mass index, bone mineral density, cement disk leakage, sandwich vertebrae distribution or Cobb angle in the two groups. In the follow-up, 8 out of 37 (21.6%) patients (with eight sandwich vertebrae) developed new fractures in non-prevention' group, whereas no new fractures were detected in the prevention group. Neither Cobb angle nor vertebral compression rate showed significant change in the prevention group during the follow-up. However, in the non-prevention group, we found that Cobb angle increased and vertebral height lost significantly (P < 0.05). Prophylactic vertebroplasty procedure applied with resorbable bone cement could decrease the rate of new fractures of sandwich vertebrae.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Between June 2011 and December 2013, 22 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures were included. There were 14 males and 8 females, aged 20-60 years (mean, 42.5 years). The fracture segments included T11 in 1 case, T12 in 4 cases, L1 in 10 cases, L2 in 6 cases, and L3 in 1 case. According to AO classification system, there were 13 cases of type A and 9 cases of type B. Spinal cord injury was classified as grade C in 2 cases, grade D in 3 cases, and grade E in 17 cases according to Frankel scale. The time from injury to operation was 3-10 days (mean, 5.5 days). All patients underwent posterior reduction and fixation via the injured vertebra, transpedicular balloon reduction of the endplate and calcium sulfate cement (CSC) injection. The ratio of anterior vertebral height, the ratio of central vertebral height, the sagittal Cobb angle, the restoration of nervous function, and internal fixation failure were analyzed. RESULTS: Primary healing of incision was obtained in the others except 2 cases of poor healing, which was cured after dressing change or debridement. All the patients were followed up 9-40 months (mean, 15 months). CSC leakage occurred in 2 cases. Absorption of CSC was observed at 8 weeks after operation with complete absorption time of 12-16 weeks (mean, 13.2 weeks). The mean fracture healing time was 18.5 weeks (range, 16-20 weeks). The ratio of anterior vertebral height, ratio of central vertebral height, and sagittal Cobb angle were significantly improved at 1 week and 3 months after operation and last follow-up when compared with preoperative values (P < 0.01), but no significant difference was found among 3 time points after operation (P > 0.01). There was no internal fixation failure or Cobb angle loss more than 10 degrees . Frankel scale was improved with no deterioration of neurologic function injury. CONCLUSION: Balloon vertebroplasty combined with short-segment pedicle screw instrumentation is simple and safe for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures, and it can improve the quality of reduction, restore vertebral mechanical performance effectively, and prevent the loss of correction and internal fixation failure.",chi,0.0

Kim,2011.0,The volumetric analysis of cement in vertebroplasty: relationship with clinical outcome and complications,10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181fc914e,"STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the safe range of cement volume during percutaneous vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A few clinical reports have addressed the relationship between cement volume and clinical outcome. However, the weakness of these studies was that subjects included were not homogeneous. No study in the clinical setting has confirmed results from biomechanical and computational studies. METHODS: We examined 96 patients with single compression fractures who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty and postoperative three-dimensional CT scan within a week between June 2006 and April 2009. The volume and fraction were measured by a CT volumetry program. Relationships between predictors and volumetric data, outcome, leakage, intraverterbal vacuum cleft (IVVC), and subsequent fracture were examined. Relationships between volumetric data and outcome, leakage, IVVC, and subsequent fracture were analyzed with stratification by the treated level. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to acquire cut-off values of volumetric data. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients (76%) were female, and the mean age was 76.3 +/- 8.4 years (range 53-97). The mean duration of follow-up was 11 months (range 6-21). Locations were as follows: T4-T10 9, T11-L1-L57, and L2-L4 30. Seventy-eight patients (81%) reported a favorable outcome. Fractured body volume (FBV) and the level treated were associated with fraction, which had an influence on outcome. The fraction of the favorable group was significantly higher. Cut-off values to acquire a favorable outcome were 11.64% (P = 0.026) on the T4-L4 level and 3.35 cm (P = 0.059), 11.65% (P = 0.059) on the T11-L1 level. Group with intradiscal leakage had a smaller volume than nonleakage group on the L2-L4 level (3.86 cm vs. 5.65 cm, P = 0.002). There were no relationships of volumetric data with epidural leakage and pulmonary embolism. The presence of IVVC increased volume on the T4-L4 and L2-L4 level (P < 0.03). Larger volume increased significantly the incidence of adjacent fracture on the L2-L4 level. The significant cut-off volume to avoid adjacent fracture was 4.90 cm on the ROC curve. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that fraction is superior to volume for predicting outcome on the T11-L1 level and an amount of cement should be determined in terms of FBV and fraction according to the treated level. A lower fraction than required for the restoration of mechanical property was enough to obtain pain relief. Intradiscal leakage on the L2-L4 level may be inevitable to obtain appropriate mechanical properties in the case of severe endplate breakdown connected with the disc space. Smaller volume is needed to avoid an adjacent fracture on the L2-L4 level. Although we did not know the reason why there was a difference among the treated level groups, one thing that is certain is the fact that level-specific approaches may be necessary for good outcome in terms of volume, fraction and FBV.",eng,1.0

Balloon kyphoplasty is a developing technique that has successfully been used in the treatment of vertebral hemangiomas as reported in a few publications. The aim of this paper is to describe 2 cases of painful vertebral hemangiomas effectively treated with percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty and review the current literature. DESIGN AND METHODS: A 38-year-old male with a painful L5 biopsy-proven hemangioma and a 75-year-old female with a painful T12, hemangioma MRI-proven both presented with thoraco-lumbar pain. Physical exams correlated with imaging findings and no neurological symptoms were present. Both patients received conservative management including physical therapy and a variety of spinal injections without benefit. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty was subsequently performed on each patient to relieve pain. RESULTS: After kyphoplasty, both patients' pain resolved immediately and they were able to resume previous levels of activity. CONCLUSIONS: This case series demonstrates a successful response to vertebral augmentation using balloon kyphoplasty when other treatment modalities failed. When compared to traditional first line treatments such as vertebroplasty or lytic therapies, kyphoplasty may offer fewer procedural risks such as a decreased exposure to radiation, a decreased risk of excessive hemorrhage, and a decreased risk of cement leakage which may make it the preferred treatment of painful vertebral hemangiomas in the future.",eng,0.0

However, diagnosis and localization of the causative vertebral level(s) may be difficult using any single imaging modality. In this retrospective study, we assessed the ability of preprocedural bone scans to determine the appropriate level(s) of subsequent vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study consisted of a retrospective chart review of 44 patients who underwent bone scintigraphs and vertebroplasties at Montefiore Medical Center from 2002 to 2008. Online medical records and reports were used to determine the level of vertebroplasty and the preprocedure bone scan levels. The data was reviewed by a panel consisting of a neuroradiologist and nuclear medicine physician for agreement. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective study assessed the utility of bone scans as a diagnostic tool to identify candidate vertebral levels for vertebroplasty and determined that bone scans were positive in 78.3% of all fractures that subsequently underwent vertebral augmentation procedures. Although no significant difference was seen in the positivity of bone scans to subsequent vertebroplasty levels between benign or metastatic compression fractures (79% vs. 76%), a difference was observed when single level vertebroplasty patients were compared with multiple-level vertebroplasty patients (87% vs. 69%). Our results support the use of whole body bone scintigraphy as a diagnostic tool prior to vertebroplasty, especially in cases where a single vertebral level is involved or MRI might be contraindicated.",eng,0.0

We prospectively assessed patients with such fractures using an eleven-point visual analogue scale for pain and the Qualeffo 41 questionnaire for quality of life. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous cement augmentation for painful vertebral compression fractures were recruited. Patients were assessed pre-procedure by completing a visual analogue scale for pain, on a scale of 0 to 10. A Qualeffo 41 questionnaire was also completed. Patients were followed up at 1 week and 3 months. RESULTS: Fifty six patients were prospectively recruited (111 vertebroplasty and 5 kyphoplasty). Visual analogue scores dropped from 6.4 +/- 2.3 pre-procedure to 4.0 +/- 2.7 at 1 week (p < 0.0001) and 4.3 +/- 2.7 (p < 0.0001) at 3 months. Three subgroups were identified; osteoporotic patients (n = 28), a second non-osteoporotic group (n = 20) who had acute fracture following fall and a third group with compression fractures secondary to metastatic disease (n = 8). At 3-month follow-up, patients with osteoporotic fractures had reduction in pain score from 6.3 +/- 2.1 to 4.8 +/- 2.7 (p = 0.02). Patients who had traumatic fractures experienced more significant pain relief, 6.4 +/- 2.6 to 3.8 +/- 2.7 (p = 0.0009) but patients with malignant fracture had most benefit, 6.0 +/- 3.0 to 1.8 +/- 0.8 (p = 0.01). Total Qualeffo scores improved from 63 +/- 15 to 49 +/- 22 (p < 0.0001). Within the domains of the Qualeffo questionnaire, most improvement was seen in pain and physical function. Median in-patient stay post procedure was one day. CONCLUSION: In our experience percutaneous cement augmentation is safe and efficacious in the management of painful VCF related to osteoporosis, trauma and cancer, achieving rapid and significant pain reduction and improvement in physical function as measured with a visual analogue scale and the Qualeffo 41 questionnaire.",eng,0.0

Initially, a standardized diagnostic algorithm is recommended to detect acute vertebral body fractures and to be able to interpret the individual fracture stability. Aim of the therapy is to assure a relatively pain-free mobilization while maintaining vertebral spine alignment. A conservative therapy concept is initiated in patients with stable fractures. In cases of persistent pain, reduced mobility or increased kyphotic misalignment minimally invasive cement augmented therapy strategies are chosen. In cases of unstable fracture morphology a more complex therapy concept has to be chosen such as hybrid stabilization. A great deal of experience is needed for revision surgery. In such cases reconstructive, multi-segmental techniques might be necessary and the instrumentation should surpass the apex of kyphosis.",ger,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To report the functional status and height restoration of 32 patients treated with kyphoplasty for multiple myeloma-related vertebral compression fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Multiple myeloma can cause significant bony resorption, and vertebral involvement is extremely common. Compression fractures due to myelomatous vertebral metastases result in significant pain and can lead to kyphosis and sagittal imbalance. Nonoperative treatment can result in deformity and continued pain, and large surgical procedures have significant morbidity. Percutaneous cement augmentation (kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty) is a minimally invasive technique that can improve pain in these patients. Kyphoplasty also has the potential to provide mild deformity correction in addition to fracture stabilization. METHODS: Study participants were patients with biopsy-proven multiple myeloma presenting with compression fracture treated with kyphoplasty. Data were compiled from patient charts and preoperative and postoperative radiographs. Patient self-reported functional status were obtained through the use of the Oswestry Disability Index. The degree of vertebral body collapse and deformity was evaluated using the method of Genant and analyzed using paired Student t test. RESULTS: Thirty-two consecutive patients who underwent kyphoplasty at a total of 76 levels for myelomatous vertebral compression fractures were identified. Sixteen fractures were at the thoracolumbar junction. The mean age was 64.3 years. The average Genant grade for the involved levels improved from 1.9 preoperative to 1.53 postoperative, which was statistically significant (P<0.0001). The postoperative Oswestry Disability Index score was obtained at a mean of 24 months, with a mean of 29.6%. Complications occurred in 12 (37.5%) patients, all consisting of minimal intraoperative cement extravasation without clinical sequelae. No changes in the neurological status were observed. The average hospital stay was 1.34 days postprocedure. CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fractures due to multiple myeloma is a safe and effective procedure that can lead to pain relief and vertebral height restoration.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed in 59 patients, comprising 36 compression fractures with IVCs in 33 patients and 49 fractures without IVCs in 26 patients. All patients underwent postprocedural CT of treated and adjacent vertebral bodies. CT findings and clinical complications were assessed retrospectively with regard to the presence of PMMA leakage. When present, leakage types were classified as intradiscal, epidural, foraminal, and perivertebral venous. The frequencies and types of leakages were compared in both groups using chi and Fisher exact tests, respectively. RESULTS: The PMMA leakage occurred in 20 (55.5%) of 36 fractures with IVCs and in 25 (51.0%) of 49 fractures without IVCs, without significant difference (P=0.679). No patients experienced clinical complications. The leakage types that frequently occurred were intradiscal (13/20, 65.0%), perivertebral venous (5/20, 25%), epidural (1/20, 5%), and foraminal (1/20, 5%) in compression fractures with IVCs; and epidural (11/25, 44.0%), intradiscal (6/25, 24%), and perivertebral venous (8/25, 32%) in those without. A significant difference was found between the most frequent types in both groups (P=0.006, P=0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: On CT after vertebroplasty, the incidences of PMMA leakage in osteoporotic compression fractures with and without IVCs were similar; however, leakage type frequencies differed.",eng,0.0

In the majority of cases, the method of treatment is percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) or kyphoplasty (PK). The number of studies verifying their efficacy in MM is still relatively small. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study has been to assess medium- and long-term pain relief as well as improvement in the quality of life (QL) after PV in MM cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There was a prospective group of 34 MM cases in which a total of 131 vertebral bodies were augmented by means of PV. It was possible to follow up 22 patients who agreed to take part in the assessment. Their level of daily activity and the level of pain were assessed using the Oswestry Back Pain scale and a visual analogue scale (VAS) before PV and at a later date (medium-term follow up was a mean of 10 months after the last operation). Five out of eight cases in which 4.5-5 years had elapsed since the first PV were tested again (long-term follow-up). RESULTS: Relief of pain and improvement of QL, assessed a mean of 10 months after PV, proved to be statistically significant. On the average, pain decreased by 4.7 points as measured on the VAS scale and the average improvement in the QL measured on the Oswestry scale was 27.7%. There were no neurological or general complications. After 4.5-5 years, there has not been any significant change in the level of pain relief or the improvement in the QL in the 5 cases in which long-term assessment was possible. CONCLUSIONS: In MM cases, PV is a simple, effective and safe method for the treatment of vertebral infiltration and compression fractures, giving permanent long-term pain relief and concomitant improvement in the QL.",eng,1.0

Nowakowski,2014.0,Failure and success in the treatment of breast carcinoma in men: a case report,", ","BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (MBC) represents a rare cause of vertebral body compression fractures along with severe pain restricting the patient's daily functioning. Limited number of cases, lack of awareness among patients and physicians leading to delayed management, further increase the average age and disease progression at presentation, resulting in a poor prognosis. Additionally, studies on MBC treatment protocols and the use of female algorithms are unavailable. The implementation of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty often results in unsatisfactory outcome due to recurrent pain and loss of vertebral height. Stentoplasty could become an alternative procedure, as described in the following case study. CASE REPORT: 54-yr-old male patient with history of breast carcinoma presented with pain in the vertebral column. Baseline X-ray and CT scan revealed multiple osteosclerotic and osteolytic metastatic lesions in the thoracic vertebrae along with a compression fracture at T9. Stentoplasty was performed to limit fracture progression. Intraoperative scan revealed restoration of the vertebral body shape. Following surgery, direct reduction in pain was obtained. Postoperative 1-year follow-up did not show any loss in height of the operated vertebra. Results of adjuvant chemotherapy administration and a new method of treatment of compression fractures caused by metastatic lesions were compared with previously published studies. CONCLUSIONS: Stentoplasty with Vertebral Body Stenting-System is an innovative method that can be applied in kyphoplasty for compression fractures caused by metastatic lesions. Nevertheless, further research on the systemic treatment of MBC is needed.",eng,0.0

Jensen,2002.0,Vertebroplasty in the mid- and upper thoracic spine,", ","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vertebroplasty performed in the mid- and upper thoracic spine presents technical challenges that differ from those in the lower thoracic and lumbar region. We herein report results of percutaneous vertebroplasty for treatment of painful, osteoporotic compression fractures in the mid- and upper thoracic spine. METHODS: Retrospective chart review identified vertebroplasty treatments performed for painful osteoporotic compression fractures at T4-T8. The following were catalogued: percentage of vertebral body compression, needle size, surgical approach, clinical outcome, volume of cement injected, and complications. RESULTS: Sixty-three vertebral bodies were treated in 41 patients. Mean percentage of compression was 44%. Bipediculate injections were used in 12 (19%) of 63 treatment levels, and unipediculate injections were used in 51 (81%) of treatments (75 injections performed). Eleven-gauge needles were used for 55 (73%) of the 75 injections, and 13-gauge needles were used for 20 (27%). Clinical follow-up was available for 76% of the patients. Mean pre- and postoperative pain intensity was 9.7 +/- 1.0 and 1.7 +/- 1.9, respectively (P <.0001). Mean pre- and postoperative medication scores were 3.4 +/- 0.7 and 1.7 +/- 1.7, respectively (P =.075). Fracture involving the pedicle used for needle access was noted in one (1.3%) of 75 injections; this pedicle had been traversed using a 13-gauge needle. Staphylococcus epidermidis infection occurred in one case. No cases of pneumothorax were noted. CONCLUSION: Transpedicular vertebroplasty is readily and safely performed using 11-gauge needles in the mid- and upper thoracic regions, yielding excellent pain relief and low complication rates.",eng,0.0

The purpose of this study was to investigate risk factors for subsequent fractures after prophylactic percutaneous vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 116 patients with osteoporotic compression fractures who underwent prophylactic percutaneous vertebroplasty. The patients were monitored with physical examinations and radiographs at 1 day and at 3 and 12 months after percutaneous vertebroplasty, and if back pain recurred. We analyzed the following multiple covariates to determine whether they were associated with recurrence: age, sex, steroid use, and the preoperative number of unhealed or chronic compression fractures. RESULTS: Subsequent fractures in any vertebra occurred within 3 months after the procedure at 26 vertebrae in 21 patients (18.1%), and 36 occurred in 28 patients (24.1%) within 12 months. The occurrence of subsequent fractures within 12 months depended on the preoperative number of unhealed vertebrae: the occurrence rate was 16.9% (11/65) for one vertebra, 27.0% (10/37) for two vertebrae, and 50.0% (7/14) for three or more vertebrae. The incidence of subsequent fractures was significantly higher in patients with three or more fractures than in those with one fracture (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences for the other factors. CONCLUSION: Patients with three or more fractures tended to have subsequent fractures, despite undergoing prophylactic percutaneous vertebroplasty. However, there was no increased risk of subsequent fractures related to prophylactic percutaneous vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

The awareness of pediatric vertebral fractures due to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is increasing. Although most of these fractures are asymptomatic, a small number of children may have severe pain. PURPOSE: In this case report we are presenting long-term result of a 9-year-old patient with intractable pain due to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporotic vertebral fracture managed by kyphoplasty. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. PATIENT SAMPLE: Case report of a 9-year-old girl who had L3 vertebral fracture due to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis treated by kyphoplasty. METHODS: The patient was a 9-year-old girl with severe back pain, and lupus nephritis. Glucocorticoid-induced L3 vertebral fracture was detected and the case was resistant to conservative treatment. Seeing this, we have performed balloon kyphoplasty procedure to L3 vertebrae. RESULTS: No complication and pain was observed after the operation although L3 vertebral height could not restored. On the 8-year control, L3 vertebral height was almost totally restored with a compression index of 10% without any clinical problem. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the patient sample of this case report is the first and the youngest patient who was treated with kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fracture intractable pain due to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, mentioned in literature. During the 8-year follow-up, no adverse effect was reported that was related to kyphoplasty procedure. This case report indicates that kyphoplasty can be an alternative method for selective pediatric intractable painful vertebral glucocorticoid-induced osteoporotic fractures, but it should be performed after careful consideration in pediatric group. We do not advise routine usage of kyphoplasty for pediatric vertebral fractures.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical and radiographic results of spinal reconstruction using Kaneda anterior spinal instrumentation for osteoporotic vertebral collapse. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recent advances in osteoporotic vertebral fracture treatment including kyphoplasty changes the role of major surgery for these pathologies. However, osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurologic compromise remains requiring surgical decompression and reconstruction. METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients who underwent anterior spinal reconstruction for osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurologic deficits were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty-six patients had single vertebral collapse and 5 had multiple lesions. They were 10 males and 21 females with mean age of 71 years. Mean follow-up period was 57 months. For anterior column support, iliac bone graft was used in 1 patient, cylindrical titanium cages in 12, and bioactive ceramic spacers in 18 patients. Kaneda anterior instrumentation was used in all the patients. Radiographic and clinical assessments were performed preoperatively and at the final follow-up. RESULTS: All the patients showed neurologic recovery. Visual analog scales (0 to 10) of low back pain and sciatic pain were 5.8 and 4.2 before surgery, and 2.1 and 0.6 at the final follow-up, respectively. Mean kyphosis of operative levels was 31 degrees before surgery, and improved to 13 degrees immediately after surgery and 21 degrees at the final follow-up. Posterior reinforcement was required in 6 patients (19%), who had severe osteoporosis and/or underwent multilevel corpectomies. Solid fusion was achieved in all patients at the final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated the advantages of anterior spinal reconstruction in osteoporotic vertebral collapse: (1) safe and reliable decompression could be performed, and (2) 80% of patients were successfully treated with anterior spinal reconstruction alone. However, patients with multilevel corpectomies and/or severe osteoporosis highly required posterior reinforcement.",eng,1.0

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BKP on the global spinal alignment in OVCF. METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients who had undergone BKP for symptomatic OVCF were retrospectively reviewed with a mean follow-up of 32 months. They were seven males and 49 females with a mean age of 75 years. Radiographic assessment was performed using upright whole spine radiographs. The parameters included vertebral kyphosis, mid-vertebral body height and global sagittal spinal alignment (C7 plumb line deviation). Clinical outcomes were evaluated using visual analog scale of back pain. RESULTS: Fifty-one of 56 patients (91.1 %) achieved immediate pain relief. Vertebral kyphosis significantly decreased from 18 to 14 degrees, but 43 patients (76.8 %) still had more than 10 degrees of local kyphosis. Subsequent vertebral compression fractures were observed in seven patients (12.5 %). Anterior deviation of a C7 plumb line (C7PL) was 3.1 cm pre-operatively, 3.1 cm postoperatively, and significantly increased to 5.9 cm at the final follow-up. Consistent results were obtained in those with pre-operative sagittal imbalance (>5 cm anterior deviation of C7PL) and with pre-existing OVCFs. CONCLUSIONS: BKP contributed to immediate pain relief, but did not improve the global sagittal spinal alignment after OVCF. This procedure should be solely indicated for painful OVCF or non-union, and could not be expected to restore the global sagittal alignment.",eng,0.0

We report an unusual case of tuberculous spondylitis diagnosed after percutaneous vertebroplasty in a patient who had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis for the first time. A 58-year-old woman, who had a history of complete recovery from pulmonary tuberculosis six years previously, was hospitalized due to severe back pain after a fall. Radiological studies revealed a fresh compression fracture at the T12 thoracic vertebra. The back pain improved dramatically, and the patient was discharged two days after the vertebroplasty. However, cold sweats and a low grade fever with severe back pain developed four weeks after the procedure. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a severe kyphosis and the T11-T12 disc space had collapsed with heterogeneous signal intensity. The results of the culture of the biopsy specimens were negative, and did not lead to identification of the causative micro-organism. However, the polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive. Treatment for tuberculous spondylitis was started and she underwent posterior fusion and instrumentation from T9-L2 after the markers for infection returned to normal.

The purposes of this study are to describe technical tips and clinical outcomes of sacroplasty under C-arm flat panel detector CT (C-arm CT) guidance, and to compare the cement distributions shown on C-arm CT with those on multi-detector CT (MDCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study consisted of patients who underwent sacroplasty for SIF using C-arm CT from May 2006 to May 2009. Technical success was assessed in terms of cement filling and leakage. Clinical outcome was assessed at short-term (less than 1 month) and long-term (more than 1 month) follow-up using a four-grade patient satisfaction scale: poor, fair, good, and excellent. After sacroplasty, all patients underwent MDCT and three radiologists compared MDCT images with C-arm CT images in consensus, focusing on the cement distribution and cement leakage. RESULTS: Sacroplasties were performed on both sacral alae in all 8 patients (male:female = 2:6, mean age = 76.9, range = 63-82). The technical success rate was 100%. At short-term follow up, 6 patients (87.5%) reported significant improvement. Five patients (62.5%) were available for long-term follow-up and all 5 patients reported a reduced pain and an improved ability to ambulate. Using MDCT as the standard of reference, the cement distribution was visualized equally well by C-arm CT. CONCLUSION: Sacroplasty under C-arm CT showed excellent technical success and good clinical outcome. There was an excellent correlation between C-arm CT and MDCT in evaluating cement distribution and cement leakage.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To report our results of a sacroplasty technique, using 3-dimensional C-arm CT for the treatment of sacral body fracture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sacroplasty may provide symptomatic relief and hasten recovery in the treatment of sacral insufficiency fractures. To our knowledge, there is no case report in the literature describing the application of sacroplasty for the treatment of sacral body fracture. We present a case of patient who had percutaneous sacroplasty for sacral body fracture and sacral alar fracture under 3-dimensional C-arm CT guidance and discuss the clinical results and technical considerations. METHODS: The procedure included a standard prone positioning of the patient and the area to be treated was prepared in a strictly sterile manner, and a local anesthesia was used. After a small skin incision, an 11-gauge vertebroplasty needle was positioned at the entry point in the sacrum. Then, the needle was inclined, directed, and advanced from the posterior aspect to the anterior aspect of the sacral vertebral body. PMMA cement was incrementally introduced in 0.5 mL aliquots and the volume of PMMA cement injected was total 4 mL. Precise needle placement and PMMA cement injection was performed under the 3-dimensional C-arm CT system and the right sacral alar region was performed in a similar manner. RESULTS: There were no peri-procedural complications occurred and the patient experienced an immediate and substantial pain relief that was persistent during a 12-month follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: To alert clinicians to the potential occurrence of inferior vena cava syndrome following percutaneous vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is a less invasive treatment solution for the osteoporotic compression fracture. There complications of the cement leakage would appear to have been rather infrequent. We report a case of inferior vena cava syndrome related to the cement leakage. METHODS: A 59-year-old woman underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty for painful T11, L1, L2, and L3 compression fractures, under general anesthesia at a community hospital. A contralateral transpedicular approach was made in order to inject polymethylmethacrylate resin into the fractured vertebra. RESULTS: Just subsequent to surgery, this patient developed dyspnea, arthralgia, myalgia, and progressive right lower-limb pain, redness, and swelling., conservative treatment being then undertaken, albeit in vain. One week after the attempted remediation of this patient's condition, she was transferred to our hospital for further management. After admission, radiography of the patient's lumbar spine (lateral view) revealed multiple cement leakage in the area of the posterior longitudinal ligament and also in the anterior paravertebral area. The abdominal and pelvic CT scan and venography revealed vertebroplasty cement leakage into the lumbar vein, the left renal vein, and the inferior vena cava. Thrombosis at the left common iliac vein and left femoral vein were noted with extension into the inferior part of the inferior vena cava. Intravenous heparin was then administered to our patient for the ensuing 20 days, at which time heparin was replaced by warfarin, in order to attempt to prevent progressive venous thrombosis. The patient's leg edema appeared to improve 10 weeks subsequent to her surgery, she then being able to perambulate using a rigid walker. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the need for clinicians to be critically aware of the potential occurrence of inferior vena cava syndrome among patients who have undergone percutaneous vertebroplasty, especially when multiple levels of vertebra are injected as part of the vertebroplasty procedure.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of bone scanning in patient selection, planning treatment and predicting response to kyphoplasty. METHODS: Retrospective chart reviews were undertaken of all kyphoplasties performed by the same orthopaedic surgeon between June 2000 and June 2004. All patients who underwent plain radiographs (X-ray) of the spine and bone scanning within 4 weeks of treatment were included. Response to treatment was assessed via a questionnaire administered to the patient 3 weeks after intervention and concomitant objective assessment. Response was graded as excellent, intermediate or poor. Each bone scan was reviewed by two nuclear physicians blinded to the initial scan results, level of treatment and therapeutic response. The readers were asked to indicate the level(s) to be treated according to the bone scan findings. Sites of chronic fractures were also recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-six procedures on 60 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. Fifty-three patients were managed by X-ray and bone scanning (A) and seven were managed by X-ray only (B). There was a significant difference in the rates of sub-optimal results between (A) and (B) (11/53 vs. 7/7, P=0.0001). There was also a significant difference in chronic fracture rates between patients with excellent outcome and those with sub-optimal results (3/42 vs. 7/11, P=0.0002). A high rate of incorrect level selection (3/7) was found in (B). In 12 patients (20%) X-ray showed multiple fractures but the bone scanning demonstrated only one level of acute disease. CONCLUSIONS: Bone scanning is an excellent predictor of response to kyphoplasty and decreases the number of vertebrae to be treated as suggested by X-ray. Preoperative bone scanning is recommended to avoid incorrect selection of treatment level. Even when the appropriate level has been selected an incomplete response can be expected if additional chronic fracture is seen on bone scanning. In the event of unexpected incomplete response, re-evaluation with bone scanning may demonstrate new disease amenable to therapy.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Our study was carried out as a retrospective study in which PVP was conducted on patients with vertebral compression fractures due to benign or malignant causes between October 2006 and December 2009. The patients' pain was evaluated on a visual analog scale (VAS). In addition, the amount of cement injected, whether or not any leakage from the vertebrae corpus was seen, and any complications resulting from the application during or after the operation were recorded. The age and gender of the patients, duration of pain, number and location of fractured vertebrae, and the duration of follow-up were also collected for evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients were included in the assessment. Of the patients, 13 were female, and the mean age was 69.5+/-8.5 years. A total of 19 PVPs were applied to the 15 patients. While initial VAS scores were 7.9+/-1.6, at the end of an average of 10.3+/-3.8 (range: 4-18) months of follow-up, VAS scores had fallen to 2.6+/-2.7. 80% of the patients reported at least a 50% reduction in pain scores compared to initial scores, and 86.7% of them reported at least a 2-point decrease in VAS scores.

Finally, there is limited evidence (grade of recommendation: C) of the value of medial branch (facet) neurotomy, sacroiliac joint injection of steroids, and intradiscal electrothermal therapy, as well as of the advantages of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy over open microdiscectomy. As the level of evidence is generally low, more prospective randomized-controlled studies are needed to establish the value of the considered methods. [References: 81]""",English,0.0

However, it remains unclear as to which procedure provides better neurological recovery. The primary purpose of this study was to compare neurological recovery among three typical procedures for OVC with neurological deficits. Secondary purpose was to compare postoperative ADL function. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data for 88 patients (29 men and 59 women) with OVC and neurological deficits who underwent surgery. Three typical kinds of surgical procedures with different decompression methods were used: (1) anterior direct neural decompression and reconstruction (AR group: 27 patients), (2) posterior spinal shorting osteotomy with direct neural decompression (PS group: 36 patients), and (3) posterior indirect neural decompression and short-segment spinal fusion combined with vertebroplasty (VP group: 25 patients). We examined clinical results regarding neurological deficits and function level in ADL and radiological results. RESULTS: The mean improvement rates for neurological deficits and ADL function level were 60.1 and 55.0%, respectively. There were no significant differences among three groups in improvement rates for neurological deficits or ADL function level. The VP group had a significantly lower estimated mean blood loss (338 mL) and mean duration of surgery (229 min) than both the AR and PS groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Direct neural decompression is not always necessary, and the majority of patients can be treated with a less-invasive procedure such as short-segment posterior spinal fusion with indirect decompression combined with vertebroplasty. The high-priority issue is careful evaluation of patients' general health and osteoporosis severity, so that the surgeon can choose the procedure best suited for each patient.",eng,0.0

Doczi,2006.0,"[Application of vertebroplasty, neuronavigation and kyphoplasty in the treatment of multiplex osteoporotic vertebral fractures--case report]",", ","Vertebroplasty is a image-guided therapeutic procedure, consisting of an injection of acrylic cement through a bone biopsy needle into a vertebral body. Main indication for vertebroplasty is painful vertebral body compression fracture due to osteoporosis. The procedure is an efficient mean with high success in pain release and prevention of further collapse of the treated vertebrae; however, the technique does not allow to realign the spine. Kyphoplasty was designed to address the kyphotic deformity. It involves the percutaneous placement of an inflatable bone tamp into a vertebral body (VB). Restoration of VB height and kyphosis correction is achieved by inflation of the tamp with contrast material liquid. After deflation a cavity is created that eases the cement application. The most modern way of guidance in spinal surgery is neuronavigation--the use of frameless stereotaxy. The system reformats patient-specific CT images acquired prior surgery, performs image fusion with intraoperative plain X-ray. Before the operation, the surgeon may create surgical plan and simulate advancement of a virtual instrument along one or more surgical trajectories. During surgery, the system tracks the position of specialized surgical instruments. All three modalities mentioned above have been applied in the treatment of our patient suffered from multiple osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures. Using kyphoplasty an almost total VB height restoration could be achieved. The pain relief was more than 50% after both operation.",hun,0.0

Furthermore, we have suggested a morphological (and functional) classification of the types of cement leakage. METHODS: Between July 2001 and February 2005, 123 percutaneous VP procedures were performed during 75 sessions in 65 patients for treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures. These included:- Group I: 28 patients, 33 sessions; 50 right sided unilateral VP under fluoroscopic control with central position of the tip of the needle within the bone marrow. Group II: 27 patients, 28 sessions; 50 bilateral VP under fluoroscopic control with separate cement injections into both hemivertebrae"". Group III: 14 patients, 14 sessions; 23 bilateral VP navigated by frameless stereotaxy (neuronavigation). Needles were positioned strictly into the lateral thirds of the vertebral bodies. Leakages were classified as epidural, foraminal, intradiscal, venous paravertebral, compact extravertebral on the post-operative CT scans, and their frequency was compared in relation to the navigation method and the position of the tip of the needle. RESULTS: Group I: extravertebral cement was detected in 23 patients (82%), and in 35 (70%) of the 50 vertebrae treated (ventral epidural: 23 vertebrae = 46%; intradiscal: 12 vertebrae = 24%; venous paravertebral: 8 vertebrae = 16%; intraforaminal: 7 vertebrae = 14%; and compact extravertebral: 3 vertebrae = 6%). Group II: extravertebral cement was detected in 20 patients (74%), and in 38 (76%) of the 50 vertebrae treated (ventral epidural: 12 vertebrae = 24%; intradiscal: 12 vertebrae = 24%; venous paravertebral: 9 vertebrae = 18%; and foraminal: 1 vertebra = 2%). Group III: extravertebral cement could be detected in 10 patients (71%), and in 10 (43%) of the 23 vertebrae treated (ventral epidural: 3 vertebrae = 13%; intradiscal: 8 vertebrae = 34%; venous paravertebral: 4 vertebrae = 17%). CONCLUSION: The incidence of epidural accumulation of bone cement may be concluded to be closely correlated with the position of the tip of the needle. Centrally injected bone cement may easily invade into the basivertebral system, and the material can then be transferred via these veins toward the ventral epidural space, and result in canal compromise and/or compression of the neural elements. The results of statistical analysis (Chi-square test) revealed that injection of bone cement into the lateral third of the vertebral body significantly decreases the extent of ventral epidural leakage. Therefore, a strictly lateral injection is advised, when the tip of the needle is placed into the lateral third of the vertebral body. Frameless stereotaxy navigation improves achievement of accurate needle placement and decreases the frequency of ventral epidural leakage. It is a safe and very accurate method for positioning of the injecting needles.""",eng,1.0

The magnitude of the pain reduction by the procedure depends on the presence of additional causes for pain as spondylosis deformans, osteochondrosis, stenosis of the spinal canal, or intervertebral nerve compression. To identify additional reasons for pain apart from a vertebral fracture-induced pain, a detailed preoperative analysis of the patients complaints is crucial for the outcome after an osteoplastic procedure. In addition, the technical aspects for performing the procedure and potential complications have to be considered as well as the stability of the cortical bone of the respective vertebral body. A complete collapse of the vertebra (vertebra plana) is an unfavorable situation for any osteoplastic procedure. In case of inflammatory or infectious vertebral lesions (e.g. spondylodiscitis) osteoplastic procedures are contraindicated. An interdisciplinary discussion of the individual case among oncologists, radiotherapists, trauma/spien surgeons, radiologists, and osteologists/endocrinologists is a prerequisite for the identification of patients who will truly benefit from an osteoplastic procedure and to avoid overtreatment of the patient and economical exploitation of healthcare providers.",eng,1.0

The pharmacological treatment of the underlying disease and the analgetic treatment of the associated back pain usually do not rid the patient's back pain completely and are insufficient to prevent the fracture-weakened vertebral body from further fracturing with long term consequences for the biomechanical competence of the entire spine. In the last 10 years the minimal invasive treatment options vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BK) have spread quickly because these procedures appeared to be promising treatments to stop the fracture and vertebral lesion associated back pain and to internally stabilize a fractured vertebral body. Numerous published reports on VP and BK appeared to support the notion of an immediate and lasting pain reduction after VP and BK in additon to a prevention of further fracturing of the treated vertebrae. The first three randomized controlled and partly blinded trials have been published this year. Two of these trials demonstrate that VP does not result in a better pain control than a sham operation whereas BK was shown to reduce back pain due to verterbal fractures for at least 12 months. Considering that more than 1.5 million people world-wide have been treated with VP and BK until now this work discusses the recent trials and suggests clinical and academic consequences on the basis of the most recent evidence.,eng,0.0

Most patients were older white men. METHODS: Assessment of which patients had evaluation of underlying bone disease (with DEXA and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels) and whether it was treated (with pharmacologic therapy). RESULTS: About 75% had a DEXA, but only half had the DEXA before the augmentation procedure. Fifty-five percent had the diagnosis of osteoporosis or osteopenia in the electronic record, and 60% had a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level usually before the procedure.

METHODS: This is a prospective study of 63 patients: 31 were treated for osteoporotic vertebral compressive fractures (OVCF) and 32 for osteolytic tumors (OT). Twenty-six patients were treated at 1 level, 15 at 2, 2 at 3, 6 at 4, 3 at 5, 4 at 6, 5 at 7 and 2 at 8. PPMA was used in 43 patients and calcium phosphate in 20. All patients were treated under general anesthesia with continuous invasive monitoring of hemodynamic changes, arterial blood gases and peripheral and regional cerebral oxygen saturation. RESULTS: Two patients had a transient drop in blood pressure between 21 and 42 % during simultaneous inflation of all four balloons at two levels and three more patients during cement injection (two PMMA, one calcium phosphate). Five patients had a cement leak (7.9 %), which was unrelated to the cement type or number of levels. Blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure and arterial oxygen partial pressure decreased statistically, but without any clinical significance after cement insertion. Peripheral and regional cerebral oxygen saturation remained unchanged. One-way ANOVA revealed no difference between these changes when clustered by the groups single level, two levels and three or more levels. CONCLUSION: BK performed under general anesthesia appears to be safe when applied in multiple levels in the same seating provided the balloons are inflated sequentially and not simultaneously and the cement is inserted slowly in a very doughy state.

As patients are living longer because of the increasing efficacy of systemic agents, appropriate follow-up and posttreatment management for these patients is critical. Tumor progression after spine radiosurgery is rare; however, vertebral compression fractures are recognized as a more common posttreatment effect. The use of radiographic imaging alone posttreatment may makeit difficult to distinguish tumor progression from postradiation changes such as fibrosis. This is the largest series from a prospective database in which the authors examine histopathology of samples obtained from patients who underwent surgical intervention for presumed tumor progression or mechanical pain secondary to compression fracture. The majority of patients had tumor ablation and resulting fibrosis rather than tumor progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate tumor histopathology and characteristics of patients who underwent pathological sampling because of radiographic tumor progression, fibrosis, or collapsed vertebrae after receiving high-dose single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery. METHODS Between January 2005 and January 2014, a total of 582 patients were treated with linear accelerator-based single-fraction (18-24 Gy) stereotactic radiosurgery. The authors retrospectively identified 30 patients (5.1%) who underwent surgical intervention for 32 lesions with vertebral cement augmentation for either mechanical pain or instability secondary to vertebral compression fracture (n = 17) or instrumentation (n = 15) for radiographic tumor progression. Radiation and surgical treatment, histopathology, and long-term outcomes were reviewed. Survival and time to recurrence were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS The mean age at the time of radiosurgery was 59 years (range 36-80 years). The initial pathological diagnoses were obtained for all patients and primarily included radioresistant tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma in 7 (22%), melanoma in 6 (19%), lung carcinoma in 4 (12%), and sarcoma in 3 (9%). The median time to surgical intervention was 24.7 months (range 1.6-50.8 months). The median follow-up and overall survival for all patients were 42.5 months and 41 months (overall survival range 7-86 months), respectively. The majority of assessed lesions showed no evidence of tumor on pathological review (25 of 32, 78%), while a minority of lesions revealed residual tumor (7 of 32, 22%). The median survival for patients after tumor recurrence was 5 months (range 2-70 months). CONCLUSIONS High-dose single-fraction radiosurgery is tumor ablative in the majority of instances. In a minority of cases, tumor persists and salvage treatments should be considered.",eng,0.0

The preprocedural and postprocedural outcome measurements of pain, mobility, and analgesic use were compared for 80 treatment sessions in 75 patients (122 total vertebrae treated). We assessed the association between the duration of pain before PVP and postprocedural outcomes by using multivariable analysis. RESULTS: Age of fracture at time of PVP was not independently associated with postprocedural pain or activity. Increasing age of fracture was independently associated with slightly greater postprocedural analgesic requirement, at least for patients who required narcotics at baseline before PVP. Greater preprocedural analgesic requirement was independently associated with greater postprocedural analgesic requirement. Reduced preprocedural mobility was independently associated with reduced postprocedural mobility. CONCLUSION: PVP is a highly efficacious therapy for relief of pain and improvement in mobility, regardless of fracture age.

The Student's t test was used for statistical analysis and a probability of less than 0.05 was determined as a significant difference. Back pain improved in all 14 patients with a VAS score of 57.8 +/- 23.5 mm (average +/- standard deviation) preoperatively and 14.7 +/- 16.4 mm at the final follow-up (P < 0.001). The wedge angle decreased from 21.6 degrees +/- 8.3 degrees (average +/- standard deviation) preoperatively to 13.2 degrees +/- 6.9 degrees at the final follow-up (P < 0.001). Callus formation was seen in four patients. Bony spurs were seen in the affected vertebra in preoperative radiographs in all patients, and were further developed to a solidified form during follow up after PVP.

The patients were affected by osteoporotic compression fractures (n=57) or by benign or malignant infiltrative processes (n=6). All patients were examined at discharge and thereafter to assess the level of pain and investigate possible changes in the quality of life. The mean length of follow-up was 15.2 months. RESULTS: After treatment, almost 90% of patients reported complete disappearance or significant alleviation of the pain. In 7 of 63 of the patient (11%) there were small asymptomatic leakages of cement outside the vertebral body. A substantial number of patients with osteoporosis, 19% of the study population, experienced new fractures following treatment with vertebroplasty. DISCUSSION: Our experience confirms the effectiveness of vertebroplasty to pain caused by vertebral fractures. If the indications are strictly followed, improvement of symptoms is often immediate, allowing the return of mobility, and patient satisfaction with surgery is higher. The use of appropriate systems limits the number of complications.",jpn,0.0

Lieberman,2006.0,"The biomechanics of 1, 2, and 3 levels of vertebral augmentation with polymethylmethacrylate in multilevel spinal segments",10.1097/01.brs.0000207466.40955.31,"STUDY DESIGN: Experimental biomechanics of multilevel segments with 0, 1, 2, and 3 vertebral levels of polymethylmethacrylate augmentation. OBJECTIVE: To compare multilevel spinal segments with different numbers (0, 1, 2, and 3) of vertebral levels augmented with polymethylmethacrylate. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The stiffness and strength of single-level polymethylmethacrylate augmentations in individual and multilevel vertebrae treated by kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty have been studied, but the biomechanics of multilevel segments with more than 1 vertebral level augmented with polymethylmethacrylate are lacking, yet this is clinically relevant in multilevel compression fracture treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 48 multilevel segments (T3-T5, T6-T8, T9-T11, T12-L2, and L3-L5) from 12 spines with known bone mineral density (BMD) were allocated into 6 groups based on the number of vertebral levels augmented: 0 levels (n = 13), control group; 1 level (n = 7), group 2; 2 levels, groups 3, 4, and 5 (n = 7 in each); and 3 levels (n = 7), group 6. They were compressed to failure, disarticulated into individual vertebrae, and retested. Stiffness and strength were statistically analyzed using a univariate analysis of variance comparing the main effects, using least significant difference comparisons with 0.05 probability level. RESULTS: Strength was dependent on BMD (P < 0.001 multilevel segments, P < 0.001 individual vertebrae), with no differences among the 6 different augmentation groups, and no significant differences between augmented and nonaugmented individual vertebrae. Stiffness was dependent on BMD (P = 0.009 multilevel segments, P < 0.004 individual vertebrae), with no significant differences among the 6 different augmentation groups, and no significant differences between augmented and nonaugmented individual vertebrae. CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel segment biomechanics are dependent on BMD and not the pattern of augmentation, so the augmentation of fractured vertebrae can be extended to adjacent levels at risk for fracture to maintain stiffness and strength, thus preventing further fractures.",eng,0.0

Belkoff,2013.0,Use of vertebroplasty to prevent proximal junctional fractures in adult deformity surgery: a biomechanical cadaveric study,10.1016/j.spinee.2013.06.039,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Vertebral compression fractures at the proximal junction are common complications of long spinal fusion surgeries that can contribute to the development of proximal junctional kyphosis or proximal junctional failure. To our knowledge, no biomechanical studies have addressed the effect of vertebral augmentation at the proximal junction. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic vertebroplasty in reducing the incidence of vertebral compression fractures at the proximal junction after a long spinal fusion in a cadaveric spine model. STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical cadaveric study. METHODS: We divided 18 cadaveric spine specimens into three groups of six spines each: a control group, a group treated with one-level prophylactic vertebroplasty at the upper instrumented vertebra, and a group treated with two-level prophylactic vertebroplasty at the upper instrumented vertebra and the supra-adjacent vertebra. In all spines, the pedicles were instrumented from L5 to T10. Using eccentric axial loading, the specimens were then compressed until failure. Failure was defined as a precipitous decrease in load with increasing compression. The effect of augmentation on load-to-failure was checked using linear regression. The effect of augmentation on incidence of adjacent fractures was checked using logistic regression. Differences at the level of p<.05 were considered significant. KyphX cement introducer was donated by Kyphon, and the pedicle screws were donated by DePuy. RESULTS: Fractures occurred in 12 of 18 specimens: five in the control group, six in the one-level group, and only one in the two-level group; these differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic vertebroplasty at the upper instrumented level and its supra-adjacent vertebra reduced the incidence of junctional fractures after long posterior spinal instrumentation in this axially loaded cadaveric model. Additional studies are necessary to determine if these results are translatable to clinical practice.",eng,1.0

Sayah,2015.0,Multifocal hemangioendothelioma of the lumbar spine and response to surgical resection and radiation,10.1016/j.spinee.2015.07.005,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma rarely occurs in the lumbosacral spine, with very few case reports of spinal hemangioendothelioma in the literature. There is variability in aggressiveness of these lesions without established treatment guidelines. PURPOSE: The aim was to present a case of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma in the lumbar spine, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, which rapidly progressed over a 2-month period as regional multifocal lumbosacral spinal lesions with epidural extension causing severe spinal canal stenosis. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This was a case report in a university hospital setting. PATIENT SAMPLE: The sample included an otherwise healthy adult male with low back pain. METHODS: Multimodality imaging was performed to help with diagnosis and management including computed tomography, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET). The patient was treated by embolization, L5 corpectomy and L4-S1 stabilization, and radiation therapy. The diagnosis was confirmed by tissue biopsy. RESULTS: The patient initially presented with severe back and leg pain after a vertebroplasty for an L5 compression fracture at an outside hospital where biopsy was negative for malignancy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse abnormality of L5 with several smaller lesions in the sacrum. Due to progressive pain 2 weeks after the vertebroplasty, the patient underwent an L5 laminectomy, L4-S1 instrumented posterior fusion, and attempted partial corpectomy for stenosis. At this surgery, the L5 corpectomy was aborted owing to profound bleeding. Pathology was again negative for malignancy. Presumed to be an atypical hemangioma, the lesion was embolized before repeat surgery where the thecal sac was decompressed by partial L5 corpectomy. Biopsy at this time revealed a vascular neoplasm, with hemangioendothelioma not excluded. Approximately 2 months after the stabilization procedure, the patient had increasing pain and bilateral lower extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed and demonstrated marked local progression of disease with new multifocal lesions involving L4 through S2 vertebrae and new severe spinal canal stenosis. These lesions were subsequently treated with localized radiation therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging 2 months after radiation therapy showed significant regression of the epidural tumor although a new metastatic lesion was discovered at T6 vertebra. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal hemangioendothelioma is a rare disease and can present in variable forms, including as a multifocal regional process--which may be mistaken for infection. Additionally, there are no standard treatment protocols for this entity. We present the extensive imaging and treatment of a single case of rapidly progressive lumbar epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, which to our knowledge has not been described with this multifocal appearance in the lumbar spine.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Vertebroplasty group (36 symptomatic patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures) was evaluated on an electronic baropodometer registering projection of weight bearing areas on feet. Load distribution between right and left foot (including rear-front of the same foot) during standing and walking was recorded and compared before (group V1) and the day after (group V2) PV. Control group (30 healthy asymptomatic volunteers-no surgery record) were evaluated on the same baropodometer. RESULTS: Mean value of load distribution difference between rear-front of the same foot was 9.45 +/- 6.79 % (54.72-45.28 %) upon standing and 14.76 +/- 7.09 % (57.38-42.62 %) upon walking in the control group. Respective load distribution values before PV were 16.52 +/- 11.23 and 30.91 +/- 19.26 % and after PV were 10.08 +/- 6.26 and 14.25 +/- 7.68 % upon standing and walking respectively. Mean value of load distribution variation between the two feet was 6.36 and 14.6 % before and 4.62 and 10.4 % after PV upon standing and walking respectively. Comparison of load distribution variation (group V1-V2, group V1-control group) is statistically significant. Comparison of load distribution variation (group V2-control group) is not statistically significant. Comparison of load distribution variation among the two feet is statistically significant during walking but not statistically significant during standing. CONCLUSIONS: There is a statistically significant difference when comparing load distribution variation prior vertebroplasty and that of normal population. After vertebroplasty, this difference normalizes in a statistically significant way. PV is efficient on equilibrium-load distribution improvement as well.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: To assess the modern literature on the use of polyethylene mesh-contained morcelized allograft (PMCMA) bone for spinal fusion and vertebral compression fracture management. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are presently no systematic reviews of PMCMA. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed within three databases (OVID, PubMed, and Google Scholar) using the following keyword search terms: vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, vertebral compression fracture, percutaneous, polyethylene mesh, and osteoporosis. RESULTS: The initial search identified 764 items, from which two pertinent technique-based articles were identified. There were no published scientific peer-reviewed or case series reporting the clinical results of this technique. The use of PMCMA in the management of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) is similar to vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. This novel, percutaneous system uses the properties of granular mechanics to establish a conforming, semirigid graft that is purportedly capable of withstanding physiologic loads. DISCUSSION: PMCMA is a novel percutaneous technology for the management of VCF and possibly for use as a conforming interbody graft. The available published literature lacks outcome data of the use of PMCMA. Careful, independent research is needed to assess the viability of this technology and its long-term results.",eng,0.0

Nevertheless, rare systemic complications have been seen, i.e., pulmonary embolisms ranging from harmless to lethal.The presence of an anesthesiologist can be especially useful in cases of systemic complications. Whether the form of anesthesia has any influence on the outcome of vertebro- or kyphoplasty is currently unknown. Local anesthesia supplemented by analgosedation is often used as an alternative to general anesthesia. The rationale for one or the other form of anesthesia can be factors like type of augmentation (vertebro- or kyphoplasty), number of vertebral levels to be treated as well as the patient's age, condition, and comorbidities.Single-shot epidural anesthesia is yet another anesthetic option that has been successfully used in our clinic for some years now. It combines the advantages of general and local anesthesia: excellent segmental analgesia even in multilevel cases in awake and responding patients.",German,0.0

For treatment, a new, alternative implant has been developed (BeadEx, Expandis, Hof HaCarmel, Israel). The aim of the present in vitro study was to evaluate whether this implant is able to restore the initial height and three-dimensional stability after fracture and whether it is able to maintain this height and stability during complex cyclic loading. METHODS: The BeadEx implant consists of small titanium rolls, which are pressed into the vertebral body through specially designed, hollow pedicle screws. The height and the three-dimensional flexibility of 18 bisegmental spine specimens (nine T12-L2, nine L3-L5) was measured, first, before and after creating a wedge compression fracture at the middle vertebral body (L1 resp. L4), second, after treatment of the fracture, and, third, during and after complex cyclic loading. The fractures were treated either with BeadEx plus internal fixator, BeadEx plus bone cement or vertebroplasty for comparison. FINDINGS: The height before fracture could almost be restored by BeadEx plus bone cement but not by BeadEx plus fixator and vertebroplasty. The total height loss after cyclic loading was smallest with BeadEx plus bone cement (in median -4.7mm with respect to the intact specimens) but -6.2mm with BeadEx plus fixator and -7.8mm with vertebroplasty. The three-dimensional stability of the specimens was clearly higher if treated with BeadEx plus fixator than with BeadEx plus bone cement or vertebroplasty. INTERPRETATION: From a biomechanical point of view, BeadEx plus bone cement can be recommended as an alternative to vertebroplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures. BeadEx plus fixator can be recommended if additional stability is needed.",eng,0.0

Schwardt,2008.0,Biomechanical evaluation of kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate cement in a 2-functional spinal unit vertebral compression fracture model,10.1016/j.spinee.2007.06.012,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Kyphoplasty is used to treat vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) by inflating a balloon within the vertebral body (VB) to create a void, thereby reducing the fracture, and then depositing polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) into that void to augment the VB. Calcium phosphate (CaP) may be preferable to PMMA because it is resorbable and nontoxic, although there are concerns about its compressive strength during the setting process. PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of a particular self-setting CaP cement to restore the structural integrity of a VCF in a 2-functional spinal unit (2FSU) cadaver model under physiologically relevant loading. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Repeated-measures compressive testing on a cadaver thoracolumbar 2FSU VCF model. METHODS: Ten 2FSU thoracolumbar specimens were tested to evaluate structural integrity under compressive loading during initial anterior VCF creation (in the central VB), after fracture, and after kyphoplasty treatment. Bipedicular kyphoplasty treatment was performed in a 37 degrees C chamber to reduce the fracture and create a void, which was filled with CaP (n=5) or PMMA (n=5) and allowed to cure for at least 15 minutes. Using fluoroscopic imaging, the sagittal area of the VB (SAVB), the minimum central VB height (MCVBH), and the wedge angle were measured on the central VB for each condition at a 1,000-N compressive load. A repeated-measures linear model was used to determine if the differences in these parameters among the various experimental conditions were statistically significant (p< .05). RESULTS: Compared with the fractured condition, there was a significant improvement in the SAVB, MCVBH, and wedge angle under a physiologically relevant 1,000-N compressive load applied after kyphoplasty. There was no statistically significant difference between treatment with CaP or PMMA. CONCLUSIONS: The structural properties of CaP-augmented VBs are similar to those of PMMA-augmented VBs. Our study indicated that, after at least 15 minutes of setting, a fractured 2FSU specimen treated with kyphoplasty with PMMA or CaP could withstand physiologically relevant loading.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval with waived consent was obtained. Medical records of 424 patients undergoing first-time, single-level vertebroplasty for osteoporotic or traumatic compression fractures were examined. Data regarding pain at rest and with activity before the procedure, along with timing and level of subsequent fractures over a 24-month period, were collected. Group 1 (n=64) included patients with no cement extension to the endplate(s), group 2 (n=216) included those with cement extension to the endplate(s) but no leakage into the disk space(s), and group 3 (n=144) included those with cement extension to the endplate(s) and cement leakage into the disk space(s). Analysis of variance and Fisher test were used to analyze the data, with significance set at P<.05. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and demographics were similar among the groups. At 1 month, for groups 1, 2, and 3, the respective mean postprocedural pain numeric scores at rest were 1.4+/-2.7, 1.4+/-2.4, and 1.6+/-2.5 (P=.51), while the respective pain scores with activity were 4.3+/-2.9, 3.8+/-3.1, and 3.9+/-3.3 (P=.50). Total subsequent fractures were noted in five (8%), 26 (12%), and 15 (10%) patients in group 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P=.77).

METHODS: 15 men and 19 women aged 41 to 85 (mean, 62) years who presented with osteoporotic wedge compression fractures of the dorsolumbar spine below T5 and had failed conservative treatment were included. Patients were assessed before and one year after PV. Kyphosis and wedge angles were measured on standardised radiographs. Pain and function were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the Ronald Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score, respectively. Patients were dichotomised based on their preoperative kyphosis (</= 10 vs. >10 degrees) and wedge angles (</= 7 vs. >7 degrees). Outcomes were classified as excellent, fair, and poor in terms of VAS scores (<3, 3-6, >6) and RMDQ scores (<8, 8-16, >16). Correlations between the kyphosis and wedge angles and VAS and RMDQ scores were assessed. RESULTS: VAS and RMDQ scores correlated positively with the kyphosis and wedge angles; the highest correlation was between the VAS score and kyphosis angle (r=0.93). A significantly greater proportion of excellent outcomes (in terms of RMDQ and VAS scores) were noted in patients with preoperative kyphosis and wedge angles of </= 10 and </= 7 degrees, respectively. CONCLUSION: PV is a viable treatment for vertebral compression fractures with regard to pain relief and improvement of function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of percutaneous vertebroplasties yielded 18 vertebrae in 17 patients that were treated with a standard bipediculate approach and 57 vertebrae in 32 patients that were treated with a modified unipediculate approach. Anteroposterior radiographs obtained after the procedure were viewed to calculate the percentage of cement opacification in both vertebral halves, and mean values were compared between uni- and bipediculate approaches by using a two-tailed Student t test. Clinical outcomes, including pain relief and change in pain medication requirements, were compared in the two groups by using the chi(2) or Fisher exact test. RESULTS: With the unipediculate approach, filling across the midline was achieved in 55 (96%) of 57 injections. Mean opacification of vertebral body halves was 83% +/- 19 (SD) and 77% +/- 16 for the bipediculate and unipediculate approaches, respectively (P =.19). Among patients with available follow-up data, 16 (94%) of 17 patients who underwent the bipediculate procedure and 28 (88%) of 32 patients who underwent the unipediculate procedure achieved adequate pain relief (P =.65) with mean decreases in pain severity of 7.3 +/- 3.1 and 6.6 +/- 2.9, respectively.

This study aims to review our techniques and outcomes in patients with VCF. Outcomes of all patients who underwent PVP at our institution from 1998 to 2014 were retrospectively collected from medical records and follow-up telephone interviews. 1174 PVP procedures for VCF in 673 patients were identified to have complete follow-up data. Patients with inadequate data were excluded from the analysis. Procedural aspects such as unipedicular or bipedicular access, vertebral region treated, amount of cement injected into vertebrae, number of levels treated at a single session, refracture rates and location, presence of a necrotic cavity, and pain outcomes were examined. Excellent rates of improvement of back pain for both single level and multilevel PVP were achieved in 92% of patients. Unipedicular or bipedicular approach, cement volume, vertebral region treated, cement extravasation, and presence of a necrotic cavity did not affect pain outcomes or refracture rates. Fractures that did develop after PVP were often adjacent and occurred earlier than distant level fractures. Lumbar vertebrae required more cement than thoracic vertebrae.

Several studies have described the reaction of normal bone to PMMA, but it is still unclear how fractured osteoporotic bone responds to PMMA. PURPOSE: To describe the response of fractured osteoporotic bone to PMMA after vertebroplasty. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Case report. METHODS: A 69-year-old woman with a previous vertebroplasty at T8 to treat an osteoporotic VCF was admitted to the hospital after she developed lower extremity motor weakness, diffuse hypoesthesia and decreased rectal tone. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the thoracic spine showed that she had severe spinal cord compression at the level of T8 and T9, as well as akyphotic deformity. A corpectomy of T8 and T9 was performed as part of a spinal cord decompression procedure. Tissue from vertebral body T8, intervertebral discs T7-T8 and T8-T9 and the PMMA implant were then submitted for histologic evaluation. RESULTS: Vertebral body T8 demonstrated viable bone trabeculae, osteoid. fibrosis, granulation tissue and multinucleated giant cells containing PMMA. Scattered necrotic bone fragments were identified throughout the vertebral body, most evident near the PMMA. PMMA leakage into the T7-T8 disc was identified without significant disc inflammation or necrosis.

Journal Article,D. H. Kim; J. S. Silber; T. J. Albert,2003.0,Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures,", ","Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a commonly encountered clinical problem. Although the majority of patients with this injury experience a benign and self-limited course of gradually resolving pain, a significant number continue to experience chronic pain and disability. In evaluating a patient with a vertebral compression fracture, the differential diagnosis must consider not only osteoporosis, but also various causes of osteomalacia, endocrinopathy, and malignancy. Accumulation of multiple compression fractures and increased thoracolumbar kyphosis are associated with a poor prognosis. Multiple medical treatments--including hormone replacement therapy, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates--are effective in maintaining or increasing bone mass and reducing the risk of compression fracture. Conventional treatment in the form of pain medication, activity limitation, and occasionally bracing is effective in returning most patients to their previous level of functioning. When therapies fail, patients may be considered for minimally invasive treatments such as vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Surgery, although enormously challenging because of poor underlying health status and structurally weak bone, may be the last resort for a small percentage of patients experiencing progressive deformity or neurologic deficit.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,D. H. Kim; A. R. Vaccaro,2006.0,Osteoporotic compression fractures of the spine; current options and considerations for treatment,10.1016/j.spinee.2006.04.013,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Vertebral compression fractures affect at least one-fourth of all postmenopausal women. The most significant risk factor is osteoporosis, most commonly seen among Caucasian women a decade or so after menopause. Osteoporosis typically results from inadequate accumulation of bone mass during childhood and early adulthood followed by rapid resorption after menopause. Primary treatment of osteoporosis includes consideration of underlying metabolic abnormalities and provision of supplemental calcium/vitamin D in conjunction with bisphosphonates or calcitonin, or both. Routine hormone replacement therapy has fallen out of favor because of concerns regarding adverse effects identified in long-term follow-up studies. Acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture management includes bracing, analgesics, and functional restoration. Patients with chronic pain beyond 2 months may be appropriate candidates for vertebral body augmentation, ie, vertebroplasty or balloon tamp reduction. Open surgical management with decompression and stabilization should be reserved for the rare patient with neural compression and progressive deformity with neurologic deficits. PURPOSE: To review current principles in the evaluation and treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures of the spine. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A literature review on management of the osteoporotic spine. METHODS: MEDLINE search of all English-language literature published between 1981 and 2005 on surgical and nonsurgical treatment of the osteoporotic spine. The references selected for listing at the conclusion of this review are those containing specific information cited within the text. RESULTS: Over 200 separate scientific and clinical studies addressing the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a common presenting complaint to spinal care specialists. Thorough differential diagnosis should be considered before attributing fractures to osteoporosis. Appropriate evaluation and medical treatment of underlying osteoporosis should be recommended or instituted. Nonsurgical management of the spinal fracture should focus on pain control and maximizing functional outcome. The role of surgical treatment remains controversial and should be reserved for patients who fail initial nonsurgical management options.",eng,0.0

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of newly developing vertebral fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty was done. The inclusion criteria were that the fracture was a single first onset fracture with exclusion of pathologic fractures. Forty-three patients were included in the study with a minimum follow up period of six months. Patients were dichotomized for the analysis by volume of cement, initial vertebral height loss, bone marrow density, and endplate-to-endplate cement augmentation. RESULTS: None of the four study variables was found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of a subsequent vertebral compression fracture. In particular, and injected cement volume of more or less that 3.5 cc was not associated with occurrence (p = 0.2523). No relation was observed between initial vertebral height loss and bone marrow density (p = 0.1652, 0.2064). Furthermore, endplate-to-endplate cement augmentation was also not found to be significantly associated with a subsequent fracture (p = 0.2860) by Fisher's exact test. CONCLUSION: Neither volume of cement, initial vertebral height loss, bone marrow density, or endplate-to-endplate cement augmentation was found to be significantly related to the occurrence of a subsequent vertebral compression fracture. Our findings suggest that as much cement as possible without causing leakage should be used.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,D. J. Kim; Y. H. Yun; J. M. Wang,2003.0,Nerve-root injections for the relief of pain in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures,", ","We have studied 58 patients with pain from osteoporotic vertebral fractures which did not respond to conservative treatment. These were 53 women and five men with a mean age of 72.5 years. They received a nerve-root injection with lidocaine, bupivicaine and DepoMedrol. The mean follow-up period was 13.5 months. The mean pain scores before treatment, at one and six months after treatment and at the final follow-up were 85, 24.9, 14.1, and 17.4, respectively. According to our modified criteria for grading results, six patients were considered to have an excellent result, 42 good and ten fair. A newly developed compression fracture was noted in three patients. There were no complications related to the injection. Our study suggests that nerve-root injections are effective in reducing pain in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures and that these patients should be considered for this treatment before percutaneous vertebroplasty or operative intervention is attempted.",eng,0.0

Kim,2008.0,The Patterns of Intraosseous Venography before Percutaneous Vertebroplasty for Osteoporotic Compression Fractures,10.3340/jkns.2008.43.6.288,"OBJECTIVE: Bone cement leakage is a well-known potential complication of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in patients with osteoporotic compression fracture. Even though there has been a controversy in the efficacy of antecedent venography to prevent this complication, many authors have performed intraosseous venography before bone cement injection. The goal of this study was to classify the venous drainage patterns of spine before PVP, and compare their patterns at different vertebral levels. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 1,042 intraosseous venographic patterns in 321 patients with 574 osteoporotic compression fractures during six-year period in one institution. To classify venogram patterns, we selected simple lateral X-ray of spine taken immediately after injection of the contrast dye. We classified the venography patterns according to contrast leakage pattern and leakage direction as follows; trabecular (TR), trabecular anterior (TA), trabecular posterior (TP), trabecular anterior-posterior (TAP), trabecular lateral (TL), venous anterior(VA), venous posterior (VP), venous anterior-posterior (VAP), soft tissue (ST). Also, we compared venogram patterns according to different spinal levels. RESULTS: In overall, the most common pattern was TP type accounting for 37.4% (390/1042) of all intraosseous venograms. This is followed by TAP in 21.5%, TR 17.4%, TA 11.6%, TL 5.8%, ST 4.1%, VA 1.2%, VP 0.6%, and VAP 0.4% in descending order of frequency. According to the spinal level, TR and TAP types were most common in thoracic spine (T6-T10), TP type was most common in thoraco-lumbar spine (T11-L2), and TP and TAP types were most common in lumbo-sacral spine (L3-S1). Contrast dye leakage to soft tissue such as psoas muscle or disc were detected in 43 (4.1%) venograms. Direct venous drainage without staining of vertebral body was found in 23 (2.2%) venograms. The 8.3% of thoracic venogram showed direct venous drainage. Thoracic level showed a more tendency of direct venous drainage than other spine levels (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The authors propose a new classification system of intraosseous venography during PVP. The trabecular-posterior (TP) type is most common through all spine, and venous-filling (V) type was most frequent in thoracic spine. Further study would be necessary to elucidate the efficacy of this classification system to prevent bone cement leakage during PVP.",eng,1.0

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of the records of 67 patients with IVVP among 652 consecutive cases of osteoporotic compression fracture. Comparisons between the IVVP group and a control group, a stable group, and an unstable group were conducted. Percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed in all patients. There were 67 patients (10.3%) in whom there were 70 vacuum phenomena of the intravertebral space. Intravertebral vacuum phenomena occurred predominantly in the thoracolumbar junction (81%) and in patients with a longer duration of symptoms (10.6 +/- 9.8 months) compared with the control group. Of 59 vertebrae for which flexion-extension radiographs were available, 26 vertebrae were categorized as stable and 33 as unstable. Twenty-one vertebrae (64%) had undergone compression fracture in the unstable group compared with nine (35%) compression fractures in the stable group. There were 28 (85%) fractures of the wedged vertebrae in the unstable group compared with 16 (61%) fractures in wedged vertebrae in the stable group. Percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed with successful clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Intravertebral vacuum phenomenon is more common than has been previously appreciated. The results of this study indicate that biomechanics, not ischemic or avascular theory, may play an important role in pathogenesis of this phenomenon. Percutaneous vertebroplasty was found to be a minimally invasive and effective procedure for the treatment of IVVP.",eng,0.0

The purpose of our study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of short-segment percutaneous pedicle screw fixation with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmentation for the treatment of osteoporotic thoracolumbar compression fracture with osteonecrosis. Methods. Osteoporotic thoracolumbar compression fractures with avascular necrosis were treated by short-segment PPF with PMMA augmentation. Eighteen were followed up for more than 2 years. The kyphotic angle, compression ratio, visual analog scale (VAS) score for back pain, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were analyzed. In addition, radiologic and clinical parameters of PPF group were compared with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) group. Results. Vertebral height and kyphotic angle of the compressed vertebral bodies were significantly corrected after the operation (P < 0.05). Further, restored vertebral height was maintained during the 2 or more years of postoperative follow-up. Compared to the PVP group the postoperative compression ratio and kyphotic angle were significantly lower in the PPF group (P < 0.05). The postoperative ODI and VAS of the PVP group were significantly higher than the PPF (P < 0.05). Conclusions.

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of bone cement augmentation procedures for long standing osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with late vertebral collapse and persistent back pain. METHODS: Among 278 single level osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures that were treated by vertebral augmentation procedures at our institute, 18 consecutive patients were included in this study. Study inclusion was limited to initially, minimal compression fractures, but showing a poor prognosis due to late vertebral collapse, intravertebral vacuum clefts and continuous back pain despite conservative treatment for more than one year. The subjects included three men and 15 women. The mean age was 70.7 with a range from 64 to 85 years of age. After postural reduction for two days, bone cement augmentation procedures following intraoperative pressure reduction were performed. Imaging and clinical findings, including the level of the vertebra involved, vertebral height restoration, injected cement volume, local kyphosis, clinical outcome and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period after bone cement augmentation procedures was 14.3 months (range 12-27 months). The mean injected cement volume was 4.1 mL (range 2.4-5.9 mL). The unipedicular approach was possible in 15 patients. The mean pain score (visual analogue scale) prior to surgery was 7.1, which decreased to 3.1 at 7 days after the procedure. The pain relief was maintained at the final follow up. The kyphotic angle improved significantly from 21.2 +/- 4.9 degrees before surgery to 10.4 +/- 3.8 degrees after surgery. The fraction of vertebral height increased from 30% to 60% after bone cement augmentation, and the restored vertebral height was maintained at the final follow up. There were no serious complications related to cement leakage. CONCLUSION: In the management of even long-standing osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture for over one year, bone cement augmentation procedures following postural reduction were considered safe and effective treatment in cases of non-healing evidence.",eng,0.0

The outstanding radiologic findings of AVN are intravertebral vacuum phenomenon with or without fluid collection. Several reports revealed that PVP or balloon kyphoplasty might be the effective treatment modalities for AVN. We also experienced excellent results when using PVP for the treatment of AVN of the vertebral body, and intend to describe the treatment's efficacy in this report. METHODS: Thirty-two patients diagnosed with AVN of the vertebral body were treated with PVP. We measured the pre- and post-operative anterior body height and kyphotic angulation. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to determine the relief of back pain. RESULTS: The anterior body height (pre-operative : 1.49 cm, post-operative : 2.22 cm) and kyphotic angulation (pre-operative : 14.47 degrees, post-operative : 6.57 degrees) were significantly restored (p<0.001). VAS was improved from 8.9 to 3.7. Pseudoarthrosis was corrected in all cases, which was confirmed by dynamic radiographs. Fluid collection was found in sixteen cases and was aspirated with serous nature. No organism and tumor cell were noted.

However, some patients do not experience pain relief after PVP. We performed several additional PVP procedures in those patients who did not have any improvement of pain after their initial PVP and we obtained good results. Our purpose is to demonstrate the effective results of an additional PVP procedure at the same previously treated level. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and the radiologic data of the PVP procedures that were performed at our hospital from November 2005 to May 2008 to determine the patients who had undergone additional PVP. We identified ten patients and we measured the clinical outcomes according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the radiologic parameters, including the anterior body height and the kyphotic angulation. RESULTS: The mean volume of polymethylmethacrylate injected into each vertebrae was 4.3 mL (range: 2-8 mL). The mean VAS score was reduced from 8 to 2.32. The anterior body height was increased from 1.7 cm to 2.32 cm. The kyphotic angulation was restored from 10.14 degrees to 2.32 degrees. There were no complications noted. CONCLUSION: The clinical and radiologic outcomes suggest that additional PVP is effective for relieving pain and restoring the vertebral body in patients who have unrelieved pain after their initial PVP.

In Kummell's disease, intravertebral instability from nonunion between the cement and bone after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) can cause persistent severe pain and dysfunction. A 75-year-old woman presented with severe pain in the lower back, both buttocks, groin, and both posterior thighs for a period of 30 days. Lumbar radiographs and magnetic resonance images showed an acute compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra with an intravertebral cleft filled with fluid.

The patient was re-evaluated with dynamic radiography, and intravertebral instability and bone cement displacement of the L1 vertebra were detected. Repeat PVP was performed. After the procedure, intravertebral instability was restored and her pain completely subsided. PVP is a good treatment choice for symptomatic Kummell's disease. However, there is no consensus on the best technique of injecting bone cement to achieve optimal results. It is important to inject more bone cement than the volume of the intravertebral cleft to prevent instability caused by nonunion in PVP for Kummell's disease.

PVP under the guidance of CTF without additional guidance by conventional C-arm fluoroscopy was performed in a total of 29 vertebral bodies in 21 patients with vertebral compression fractures. While monitoring sectional CTF images, the needle was advanced from the skin to the target vertebra. Contrast media and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) were injected into the target vertebra with careful monitoring of their distribution. After the procedure, an evaluation was conducted to determine whether extraosseous leakage of PMMA occurred and whether sufficient filling of PMMA had been achieved. Needle placement into the target vertebra was easily achieved with both the transpedicular and posterolateral approaches. Injection of PMMA and venous leakage of contrast media were carefully monitored in all patients, and early detection of PMMA leaking was achieved in 5 patients. Extraosseous leakage that had not been detected during the procedure was not found upon postoperative evaluation. Pain scales were significantly decreased after the procedure, and no obvious complications occurred following the procedure.

PURPOSE: We assessed the radiographic and clinical outcome of patients who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in osteoporotic compression fractures with a minimum of 5 years follow-up. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is effective surgical method for treating osteoporotic compression fracture. METHODS: Between January 2000 and August 2005, 159 patients were treated with PVP for osteoporotic compression fracture at our department; 43 patients died during follow-up, and 69 patients (121 vertebras) were available for follow-up for over 5 years. We analyzed the clinical and radiologic outcome including cement feature. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 5.7 years. Clinical outcome by mean visual analogue scale (VAS) score revealed a decreased 4.9 points perioperatively. A decreased score was maintained over 5 years in 46% of patients. A new adjacent vertebral fracture was documented by 33 vertebral bodies in 22 patients. During the follow-up period, 43 patients (38%) in 112 patients died. Anterior body heig ht in the last follow-up was improved about 0.3 mm compared with the preprocedural value, but was not statistically significant. Also, the focal kyphotic angle was reduced from 12.3 degrees at the preprocedural state to 11.7 degrees at the postprocedural state, but was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: We analyzed kyphosis correction, vertebral height restoration, and bone cement leakage in patients treated by vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) to compare the effectiveness of VP and KP for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Superior results have been reported for the use of KP for kyphotic deformity correction and collapsed vertebral height restoration. However, there are no previous comparative reports comparing the efficacy of KP versus VP according to the shapes of fractured vertebrae. METHODS: A total of 103 patients underwent either VP (n=58) or KP (n=45) for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture between October 2006 and September 2009. We organized the patients into 6 groups according to treatment method and fracture type: VP (wedge-shaped), VP (V-shaped), VP (flat-shaped), KP (wedge-shaped), KP (V-shaped), and KP (flat-shaped). Comparisons were performed for kyphosis correction, vertebral height restoration, and cement leakage between VP and KP groups. RESULTS: KP was more effective than VP, especially for middle column height restoration and bone cement leakage prevention, for all fracture types (P value <0.05). In addition, KP was more effective in anterior height restoration and kyphosis correction in both flat and wedge-shape fractures (P value <0.05). However, posterior column vertebral height was not restored in either the KP group or the VP group. The clinical outcomes did not differ between the 2 groups (P value >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: KP has a significant advantage over VP in terms of kyphosis correction, vertebral height restoration, and cement leakage prevention. KP has an obvious advantage in terms of middle vertebral height restoration and cement leakage prevention, especially for V-shape compression fractures.",eng,0.0

Preoperative osteonecrosis and a lump cement pattern were the most important risk factors for the peri-cement halo phenomenon, and it was associated with vertebral recollapse. INTRODUCTION: We observed a newly developed radiolucent area around the bone cement following vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic compression fractures. Here, we describe the importance of the peri-cement halo phenomenon, as well as any associated risk factors and long-term sequelae. METHODS: In total, 175 patients (202 treated vertebrae) were enrolled in this study. The treated vertebrae were subdivided into two groups: Group A (with halo, n = 32) and Group B (without halo, n = 170), and the groups were compared with respect to multiple preoperative (age, sex, BMD, preoperative osteonecrosis) and perioperative factors (operative approach: vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty; cement distribution pattern; cement leakage; cement volume), and postoperative results (VAS score, recollapse). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the incidence of the peri-cement halo and all of the parameters described above. RESULTS: Rates of osteonecrosis were also significantly higher in Group A than in Group B (62.5% vs. 31.2%, p < 0.05), and kyphoplasty (KP) was performed more frequently in Group A (43.8% vs. 17.6%, p < 0.05).

Logistic regression analysis also showed that preoperative osteonecrosis (OR = 3.679; 95% CI = 1.677-8.073; p = 0.001), KP (OR = 3.630; 95% CI = 1.628-8.095; p = 0.002), lump pattern (OR = 13.870; 95% CI = 2.907-66.188; p = 0.001), and vertebral recollapse (OR = 5.356; 95% CI = 1.897-15.122; p = 0.002) were significantly associated with peri-cement halo. CONCLUSIONS: The peri-cement halo was found to be associated with vertebral recollapse, this sign likely represents a poor prognostic factor after vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic compression fractures.""",eng,0.0

Im,2013.0,"A nation-wide, outpatient-based survey on the pain, disability, and satisfaction of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures",10.4184/asj.2013.7.4.301,"STUDY DESIGN: A nation-wide, outpatient-based, cross-sectional survey with the use of questionnaires. PURPOSE: To evaluate the pain, disability and satisfaction of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: There are no nation-wide data in Korea on the degree of pain, disability and satisfaction with treatment in patients with OVCFs. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey of 573 patients with OVCFs. After excluding incomplete questionnaires (missing more than 30% of the variables), 430 patient-physician-matched data sets were collected for this survey. RESULTS: Patients with OVCFs were managed with conservative treatment in 63% and with a vertebroplasty in 37%. The means of the latest visual analogue scale (VAS, 5.2) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, 47.7) scores checked at the time of survey were significantly higher than those VAS and ODI scores prior to OVCFs (the prefracture VAS and ODI scores, 3.6 and 26.3, respectively; p<0.001 for both comparisons). However, the means of the latest VAS and ODI scores were insignificantly different between the conservative and vertebroplasty groups, irrespective of the duration from the fractures. Overall, 75% of patients were satisfied with their clinical outcomes. However, the percentages of patient's satisfaction were not significantly different between the conservative and vertebroplasty groups. Eighty-eight percent of patients felt some or marked deterioration of their general health condition following OVCFs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that although most patients with OVCFs were satisfied with their clinical outcomes, their subjective general health conditions, as well as their pain and disability, did not recover to the prefracture state.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the behavior of fractured osteoporotic vertebral bodies treated with either vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty under repetitive loading conditions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are newer alternatives for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Loading conditions that can lead to fractures treated with these methods will likely be encountered subsequently; as such, it is important to understand differences in the biomechanical behavior of the resultant constructs. METHODS: There were 7 pairs of osteoporotic T8 and T10 vertebral bodies cyclically loaded to produce a vertebral compression fracture. Of each pair, one was assigned to the kyphoplasty group and the other to the vertebroplasty group. After treatment, specimens were cyclically loaded to 100,000 cycles, between 20% and 70% of the predicted failure load. RESULTS: Height was restored with kyphoplasty, but the vertebral bodies showed significant height loss during cyclic loading. Vertebroplasty specimens had higher compression stiffness and smaller height reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Under repetitive loading conditions, fractured vertebral bodies treated with kyphoplasty were initially taller, but because of a progressive loss of height during loading, the resulting constructs were shorter after 100,000 cycles than those treated with vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

PURPOSE: To compare the level of restoration of the vertebral height, improvement in the wedge and kyphotic angles, and the incidence of complications in osteoporotic compression fracture in patients treated with either kyphoplasty or lordoplasty. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Kyphoplasty involves recompression of the vertebral bodies. Recently, a more effective method known as lordoplasty was introduced. METHODS: Between 2004 and 2009, patients with osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures were treated by either kyphoplasty (n = 24) or lordoplasty (n = 12) using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement, and the results of the two interventions were compared. A visual analogue scale was used to measure the pain status. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were analyzed to quantify the anterior vertebral height restoration and the wedge and kyphotic alignment correction. RESULTS: All patients in both groups reported a significant decrease in pain. The anterior heights increased 24.2% and 17.5% after the lordoplasty and kyphoplasty procedures, respectively (p < 0.05). Three months after the procedures, there was a larger decrease in the loss of anterior vertebral height in the kyphoplasty group (12.8%) than in the lordoplasty group (6.3%, p < 0.05). The wedge angles decreased after both procedures. The wedge angle in the lordoplasty group maintained its value after 3 months (p < 0.05). The kyphotic angular correction was 11.4 and 7.0 degrees in the lordoplasty and kyphoplasty groups, respectively (p < 0.05). Both kyphotic deformities worsened to a similar degree of 5 degrees after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Lordoplasty is more useful than kyphoplasty in terms of the improved anatomic restoration and postoperative maintenance.",eng,0.0

Ahn,2004.0,Risk factors of new compression fractures in adjacent vertebrae after percutaneous vertebroplasty,", ","PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk factors related to the development of new fractures in adjacent vertebrae after vertebroplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 106 patients in whom 212 vertebroplasties were performed during a period of 3 years. Evaluations of the five vertebrae superior and inferior to the treated vertebra were performed. Consequently, 913 vertebrae were evaluated and the fracture-free interval of the vertebral body adjacent to the treated vertebra was calculated. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-two (7.9%) new fractures were revealed. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 1-year fracture-free rate was 93.1%. The mean fracture-free interval was 32 months (95% CI, 32 to approximately 33 months). The greater degree of height restoration of the treated vertebra, the location of the adjacent vertebra in the TL junction, and the shorter distance between the treated and the adjacent vertebra increased the risk of new vertebral fractures. CONCLUSION: Thoracolumbar junction, shorter distance from the treated vertebrae, and greater degree of height restoration of the cemented vertebrae may increase the fracture risk of vertebrae adjacent to cement vertebrae after vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

Plain radiographs showed progressive collapse of the L1 vertebral body and severe kyphosis at the thoracolumbar junction. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a posterior element fracture as well as osteonecrosis of the L1 vertebral body. An L1 percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed, followed by bone cement-augmented screw fixation to maintain stability and correct the kyphotic deformity.

We reviewed 500 patients on whom percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was performed, at 612 levels in terms of patient selection, operation technique, medication, and clinical outcomes during the follow-up course for 2 yr study period. To confirm the most painful level among the multiple fracture sites, physical examination after facet joint block under the fluoroscope was the most reliable method. The mean total lumbar spine fracture threshold of bone mineral density was 0.81+/-0.05 g/cm2. The mean changes of numeric rating scale scores, Oswestry Disability Index except sex life, and Karnofsky performance status were -72.00, -83.50 and +60.62% in the osteoporosis group and -51.89, -45.02, and 69.03% in the tumor group.

In order to identify the ideal candidate for vertebroplasty, pre-operative prognostic demographic or clinico-radiological factors need to be identified. The objective of this study was to identify the pre-operative prognostic factors related to the effect of vertebroplasty on acute pain control using a cohort of surgically and non-surgically managed patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with single-level acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture at thoracolumbar junction (T10 to L2) were followed. If the patients were not satisfied with acute pain reduction after a three-week conservative treatment, vertebroplasty was recommended. Pain assessment was carried out at the time of diagnosis, as well as three, four, six, and 12 weeks after the diagnosis. The effect of vertebroplasty, compared with conservative treatment, on back pain (visual analogue score, VAS) was analysed with the use of analysis-of-covariance models that adjusted for pre-operative VAS scores. RESULTS: A total of 342 patients finished the 12-week follow-up, and 120 patients underwent vertebroplasty (35.1%). The effect of vertebroplasty over conservative treatment was significant regardless of age, body mass index, medical comorbidity, previous fracture, pain duration, bone mineral density, degree of vertebral body compression, and canal encroachment. However, the effect of vertebroplasty was not significant at all time points in patients with increased sagittal vertical axis. CONCLUSIONS: For single-level acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, the effect of vertebroplasty was less favourable in patients with increased sagittal vertical axis (> 5 cm) possible due to aggravation of kyphotic stress from walking imbalance.Cite this article: Y-C.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After retrospective review of spot radiographs during PVP, 23 patients were included in this study. Age, sex, symptom duration, functional status, injected cement volume, and type of approach were evaluated using patients' medical and operative records. The following factors were analyzed on radiographs, MRI, dual bone densitometry, spot radiographs during PVP, and CT: anatomical location of the fracture, bone mineral density, morphology of the fracture, IVC morphology, presence of surrounding non-enhanced area and bone marrow edema, degeneration of adjacent discs, co-existing old compression fractures, patterns of cement opacification, pre-procedural kyphosis, and post-procedural kyphosis correction. Effectiveness was defined as a much-improved state or no pain after 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months. Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between those factors and therapeutic outcome using Fisher's exact test, Chi-squared test, and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty of IVC was effective in 16 out of 23 (69.6%) patients after 1 week and 1 month and 15 out of 23 (65.2%) patients after 2 months. Post-procedural kyphosis correction >or=5 and poor functional status (full dependency) were more common in the ineffective group after 1 week and 2 months respectively (P = 0.047, P = 0.02). Kyphotic correction >or=5 was related to pre-procedural kyphosis >or=15 (P = 0.018). Functional status was related to subsequent fracture (P = 0.005). Other factors were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty on osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCF) with IVC was effective in only about 69.6% of patients after the first week and month and in 65.2% of patients after 2 months. Post-procedural kyphosis correction >or=5 was associated with poor outcomes after the first week.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. From June 2006 to September 2007, 75 patients (57 women, 18 men; mean age, 74.78 years; range, 48-93 years) who underwent 78 PVP sessions at 119 levels for osteoporotic VCFs were prospectively enrolled in this study. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest and treated vertebrae were obtained after PVP. The presence, location, involved pulmonary arteries, number, and size of each pulmonary cement embolus were analyzed at CT. Possible risk factors were analyzed as follows: Age, injected cement volumes, and numbers of treated vertebrae were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney U test; operators (radiologist or nonradiologist), level of treated vertebrae, guidance equipment, approach (uni- or bipedicular), presence of intravertebral vacuum clefts, and presence of paravertebral venous leakage were analyzed by using Pearson chi(2) and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: Pulmonary cement emboli developed in 18 (23%) of 78 PVP sessions and were detected in the distal to third-order pulmonary arteries. Only cement leakage into the inferior vena cava showed a statistically significant relationship to pulmonary cement embolism (P = .03). A higher frequency of pulmonary cement embolism was noted for the absence of intravertebral vacuum clefts, for the bipedicular approach, and for a nonradiologist operator with C-arm fluoroscopy (P > .05).

PKP has been used for VCFs with satisfactory results. Several studies about subsequent VCFs adjacent to cemented vertebrae have been reported after PKP. However, the presence and significance of recompression of operated vertebrae have not been adequately described. In total, 80 patients treated with PKP for single thoracolumbar VCFs were reviewed. The follow-up period was at least 1 year. Patients were divided into those without recompression (maintained group, n = 70) and those with recompression (recompressed group, n = 10). Plain roentgenography (preoperative, operative, and last), preoperative BMD, and preoperative MRI were checked. Age, gender, T-score in BMD, duration of symptom, compression rate (CR) of VCF, reduction rate, kyphotic angle (KA), reduction angle, intervertebral cleft (IVC), and non-PMMA-endplate-contact (NPEC) were evaluated. To evaluate the clinical results, we checked the VAS score at each follow-up period. All data were analyzed statistically. The CR for the recompressed group increased significantly after surgery and decreased at the last follow-up (p < 0.05). The last CR was not significantly different from the preoperative CR. The KA showed the same pattern. The preoperative, postoperative, and last VAS scores were significantly different from one another in both groups (p < 0.05). Between the groups, preoperative KA, postoperative KA, last KA, IVC, and NPEC were significantly different (p < 0.05). In particular, last KA, IVC, and NPEC showed highly significant differences (p < 0.001). In a correlation test for the evaluated factors, IVC (r = 0.557) and NPEC (r = 0.496) were the most significant. The presence of IVC and NPEC may play an important role in inducing recompression of treated vertebrae after PKP.

Approximately 37% of patients with plasma cell myeloma are over the age of 75 and the median age of diagnosis is 70. The management approach to over 70s differs from younger patients, as treatment goals may vary and underlying co-morbidities and expected treatment related toxicities have to be taken into account. Individualisation of management is important, aiming to achieve the best response whilst minimising adverse events. A proportion of patients will be unable to tolerate any treatment with palliation being appropriate. Age alone should not be a barrier to treatment however, with some fit patients over the age of 70 potentially benefitting from intensive treatment options including high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is indicated in the over 70s; this should be employable in a clinic outpatient setting to make it feasible. Outcomes of this assessment potentially help physicians' choice of therapy. For decades the combination of Melphalan and prednisolone was the standard of care for older MM patients.

This unwanted effect may be reduced by using more compliant cements. However, systematic experimental comparison of structural properties between standard and low-modulus augmentation needs to be done. This study investigated how standard and low-modulus cement augmentation affects apparent stiffness, strength, and endplate pressure distribution of vertebral body sections. METHODS: Thirty-nine human thoracolumbar vertebral body sections were prepared by removing cortical endplates and posterior elements. The specimens were scanned with a HR-pQCT system and loaded in the elastic range. After augmentation with standard or low-modulus cement they were scanned again and tested in two steps. First, the contact pressure distribution between specimen and loading plates was measured with pressure-sensitive films. Then, they were loaded again in the elastic range and compressed until failure. Apparent stiffness was compared before and after augmentation, whereas apparent strength of augmented specimens was compared to a non-augmented reference group. RESULTS: Vertebral body sections with fillings connecting both endplates were on average 33% stiffer and 47% stronger with standard cement, and 27% stiffer and 30% stronger with low-modulus cement. In contrast, partial fillings showed no significant strengthening for both cements and only a slight stiffness increase (<16%). The averaged endplate pressure above/below the cement was on average 15% lower with low-modulus cement compared to standard cement. CONCLUSION: Augmentation connecting both endplates significantly strengthened and stiffened vertebral body sections also with low-modulus cement. A trend of reduced pressure concentrations above/below the cement was observed with low-modulus cement.",eng,0.0

We aimed to clarify whether vertebroplasty has additional value compared with optimum pain treatment in patients with acute vertebral fractures. METHODS: Patients were recruited to this open-label prospective randomised trial from the radiology departments of six hospitals in the Netherlands and Belgium. Patients were aged 50 years or older, had vertebral compression fractures on spine radiograph (minimum 15% height loss; level of fracture at Th5 or lower; bone oedema on MRI), with back pain for 6 weeks or less, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 5 or more. Patients were randomly allocated to percutaneous vertebroplasty or conservative treatment by computer-generated randomisation codes with a block size of six. Masking was not possible for participants, physicians, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was pain relief at 1 month and 1 year as measured by VAS score. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00232466. FINDINGS: Between Oct 1, 2005, and June 30, 2008, we identified 431 patients who were eligible for randomisation. 229 (53%) patients had spontaneous pain relief during assessment, and 202 patients with persistent pain were randomly allocated to treatment (101 vertebroplasty, 101 conservative treatment). Vertebroplasty resulted in greater pain relief than did conservative treatment; difference in mean VAS score between baseline and 1 month was -5.2 (95% CI -5.88 to -4.72) after vertebroplasty and -2.7 (-3.22 to -1.98) after conservative treatment, and between baseline and 1 year was -5.7 (-6.22 to -4.98) after vertebroplasty and -3.7 (-4.35 to -3.05) after conservative treatment. The difference between groups in reduction of mean VAS score from baseline was 2.6 (95% CI 1.74-3.37, p<0.0001) at 1 month and 2.0 (1.13-2.80, p<0.0001) at 1 year. No serious complications or adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: In a subgroup of patients with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and persistent pain, percutaneous vertebroplasty is effective and safe. Pain relief after vertebroplasty is immediate, is sustained for at least a year, and is significantly greater than that achieved with conservative treatment, at an acceptable cost.

Verhaar,2010.0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty is not a risk factor for new osteoporotic compression fractures: results from VERTOS II,10.3174/ajnr.A2148,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: PV is increasingly used as treatment for osteoporotic VCFs. However, controversy exists as to whether PV increases the risk for new VCFs during follow-up. The purpose of our research was to assess the incidence of new VCFs in patients with acute VCFs randomized to PV and conservative therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: VERTOS II is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing PV with conservative therapy in 202 patients. Incidence, distribution, and timing of new VCFs during follow-up were assessed from spine radiographs. In addition, further height loss during follow-up of treated VCFs was measured. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 11.4 months (median, 12.0; range, 1-24 months), 18 new VCFs occurred in 15 of 91 patients after PV and 30 new VCFs in 21 of 85 patients after conservative therapy. This difference was not significant (P = .44). There was no higher fracture risk for adjacent-versus-distant vertebrae. Mean time to new VCF was 16.2 months after PV and 17.8 months after conservative treatment (logrank, P = .45). The baseline number of VCFs was the only risk factor for occurrence (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.95) and number (P = .01) of new VCFs. After conservative therapy, further height loss of treated vertebrae occurred more frequently (35 of 85 versus 11 of 91 patients, P < .001) and was more severe (P < .001) than after PV. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of new VCFs was not different after PV compared with conservative therapy after a mean of 11.4 months' follow-up.

Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV), a minimally invasive technique, is gaining popularity as a new treatment option. Many prospective and retrospective studies have reported on the effectiveness and safety of PV, but no large randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been published. OBJECTIVE: To estimate cost-effectiveness of PV compared to conservative therapy in terms of: pain reduction, quality of life, complications, secondary fractures and mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The VERTOS II study is designed as a prospective, multicenter RCT. Patients with a painful VCF with bone edema on MR imaging, local back pain for 6 weeks or less, osteopenia and aged 50 years or older, after obtaining informed consent are included and randomized for PV or conservative therapy. In total 200 patients will be enrolled. Follow-up is at regular intervals during a 1-year period with standard questionnaires, addressing: clinical symptoms, pain medication, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Secondary fractures, necessary additional therapies and complications are recorded. CONCLUSION: The VERTOS II study is the first methodologically sound RCT designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of PV compared to conservative therapy in patients with an acute osteoporotic VCF.

Steffen; B. von Rechenberg,2013.0,Bone augmentation for cancellous bone- development of a new animal model,https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2474-14-200,"BACKGROUND: Reproducible and suitable animal models are required for in vivo experiments to investigate new biodegradable and osteoinductive biomaterials for augmentation of bones at risk for osteoporotic fractures. Sheep have especially been used as a model for the human spine due to their size and similar bone metabolism. However, although sheep and human vertebral bodies have similar biomechanical characteristics, the shape of the vertebral bodies, the size of the transverse processes, and the different orientation of the facet joints of sheep are quite different from those of humans making the surgical approach complicated and unpredictable. Therefore, an adequate and safe animal model for bone augmentation was developed using a standardized femoral and tibia augmentation site in sheep.
METHODS: The cancellous bone of the distal femur and proximal tibia were chosen as injection sites with the surgical approach via the medial aspects of the femoral condyle and proximal tibia metaphysis (n = 4 injection sites). For reproducible drilling and injection in a given direction and length, a custom-made c-shaped aiming device was designed. Exact positioning of the aiming device and needle positioning within the intertrabecular space of the intact bone could be validated in a predictable and standardized fashion using fluoroscopy. After sacrifice, bone cylinders (O 32 mm) were harvested throughout the tibia and femur by means of a diamond-coated core drill, which was especially developed to harvest the injected bone area exactly. Thereafter, the extracted bone cylinders were processed as non-decalcified specimens for muCT analysis, histomorphometry, histology, and fluorescence evaluation.
RESULTS: The aiming device could be easily placed in 63 sheep and assured a reproducible, standardized injection area. In four sheep, cardiovascular complications occurred during surgery and pulmonary embolism was detected by computed tomography post surgery in all of these animals. The harvesting and evaluative methods assured a standardized analysis of all samples.
CONCLUSIONS: This experimental animal model provides an excellent basis for testing new biomaterials for their suitability as bone augmentation materials. Concomitantly, similar cardiovascular changes occur during vertebroplasties as in humans, thus making it a suitable animal model for studies related to vertebroplasty.",English,1.0

This has potential consequences for health services, patients and their families. Treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) has been limited to non-surgical measures so far. The social and functional consequences of balloon kyphoplasty, a recent development for the treatment of VCF, were assessed in this cohort study. METHODS: Data collected prospectively from 53 patients undergoing balloon kyphoplasty for symptomatic OVCF in our hospital's spinal unit were compared with data from an historical age-matched group of 51 consecutive patients treated conservatively for symptomatic OVCF. Social functionality was recorded prior to the injury, and at 6-month and 1-year follow-up; mortality was recorded at 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS: The mortality rate in the balloon kyphoplasty group was 11 % (6/53) at 1 year post-OVCF, versus 22 % (11/51) in the conservatively treated controls. A drift to a lower level of social functionality (defined by a lower level of independence) was observed at 1 year in 21 % of patients in the balloon kyphoplasty group versus 53 % of patients in the conservatively treated group. A drift to a lower level of independence was noted in 67 % of the conservatively treated patients who started at a lower level of functionality versus 20 % drift in a similar group who were treated with balloon kyphoplasty. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in mortality and drift in social functionality at 1 year following treatment with balloon kyphoplasty suggests that it is a viable option for the management of OVCFs.",eng,0.0

Bommireddy,2011.0,Impact of kyphoplasty treatment for vertebral compression fractures on pain and function in 105 patients,", ","PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Vertebral compression fractures are very common. Symptomatic relief with conservative therapy is often difficult to achieve. Balloon kyphoplasty is a relatively new technique which stabilises the vertebral body and restores spinal alignment in recent fractures, it achieves significant pain relief and improved functional outcome is reported. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the level of pain relief and functional outcome in patients who were initially treated conservatively for 4-6 weeks and if symptoms did not have tendency to resolve, then had kyphoplasty surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 105 patients underwent balloon kyphoplasty between April 2006 and August 2010 and had 1 year follow up. Total 170 levels were augmented, 65% (n=68) of patients were female and the average age was 74 years. Pain relief was assessed using visual analogue score (VAS) and functional outcome using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). RESULTS: Results showed decrease of the average pre-operative VAS from 8.2 to 4.4 in the immediate postoperative period (p=0.000). This dramatic improvement remained and was 4.1 at 6 weeks, 3.3 at 6 months and 3.6 at 1 year. The average pre-operative ODI was 58. This improved to 47 in the immediate post-operative period (p=0.002). At 6 weeks this had improved further to 40 and further improvements were seen at 6 months (ODI 37) and 1 year (ODI 38). The average screening time was 2 minutes and 20 seconds. The average volume of cement used per level was 5.5 cm3. Radiographic measurements were performed by independent radiologist. The average pre-operative vertebral angle was 11.6 degrees and 10.9 degrees postoperatively. This was maintained throughout the follow up. This represented a negligible 6% improvement in vertebral body angle. We did not experience any clinically significant complications, we have encountered 11 minor complications which did not require any additional measures (cement leaks, penetration of the vertebral body margins by balloons or K wires and rib fractures). DISCUSSION: Pain relief and improvement of functional outcome was sustained after one year. Limited number of patients who had 2 year follow up showed trend of minimal deterioration of both parameters (VAS and ODI). This can be explained by incidence of few adjacent segment fractures and progressive overall osteoarthritic changes in this aging population. Radiological evaluation showed maintenance of achieved alignment which did not deteriorate over time. Complication rate was low and did not require any further surgical interventions and did not have any effect on final good clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Balloon kyphoplasty proved to be safe surgical technique and should be considered in patients with ongoing pain following an acute vertebral compression fracture that does not improve with initial conservative treatment. It significantly improves pain and functional status in elderly patients.",eng,0.0

John,2011.0,Early results after vertebral body stenting for fractures of the anterior column of the thoracolumbar spine,10.1016/j.injury.2011.04.006,"INTRODUCTION: Vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty have shown to improve pain and functional outcome in cases with symptomatic vertebral fractures. Although restoration of the vertebral body height and kyphosis seemed to be easier with balloon kyphoplasty, it became clear that some of the correction achieved by the balloon is lost once it was deflated. Vertebral body stent was developed to eliminate this phenomenon. To our knowledge this is the first study in describing this technique in clinical settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with 20 fractured vertebral bodies were included. All fractures were Type A1.3 or A3.1 (incomplete burst). Information about pain (visual analogue scale-VAS) and function (Oswestry disability index-ODI) and vertebral body deformity (vertebral angle-VA) was recorded in a prospective way at regular intervals. Patients were classified into osteoporotic group (7 patients) and traumatic groups (10 patients, younger than 60 years). RESULTS: There were 6 male and 11 female patients with mean age of 58.1 years (31-88 years). Mean follow up was 12 months. The preoperative pain level showed a mean VAS score of 8.9 in osteoporotic group and 9.7 in traumatic group. Postoperatively, in osteoporotic group, mean VAS was 4.8 at 6 weeks, 4.0 at 6 months and 2.5 at 12 months compared with traumatic fracture group where it was 2.7 at 6 weeks, 2.2 at 6 months and 1.6 at 12 months. Mean ODI in osteoporotic group was 41.7% (14-58%) and in traumatic group it was 20.4% (6-33%). Mean vertebral body angle prior to surgery in osteoporotic group was 9.7 whilst postoperatively it was 5.2 degrees ; so the mean correction achieved was 4.5 degrees . In traumatic group preoperative VA was 13 degrees whilst postoperatively it was 5.7 degrees ; therefore the mean correction achieved was 7.3 degrees . None of the patients lost reduction at their last follow up. CONCLUSION: Vertebral body stenting leads to satisfactory improvement in pain, function and kyphosis correction in the treatment of osteoporotic and traumatic fractures. Anterior spinal column, especially the fragmented superior endplate is nicely reconstructed by the stent provided it is inserted accurately. With addition of posterior transpedicular instrumentation, indications for this technique may be wider covering some Type B and C fractures with similar vertebral body damage.",eng,1.0

METHODS: In this single-center retrospective observational study, four consecutive patients with sacral insufficiency fractures were treated with navigation-guided radiofrequency kyphoplasty for sacroplasty between April 2010 and May 2012. Symptom characteristics, pain duration and pain intensity were recorded for each patient. Cement extravasation was evaluated in thin-sliced and triplanar reconstructed CT scans of the sacrum. RESULTS: Four female patients with painful sacral insufficiency fractures and extensive osteopenic areas significantly improved from an average pre-treatment VAS score of 8.3 +/- 0.5 to 2.3 +/- 1.0 (p < 0.001) on the first postoperative day and to 1.3 +/- 1.9 (p < 0.004) at follow-up (mean, 20.1 weeks). Slight cement extravasations were observed without evidence of being symptomatic. No major complications or procedure-related morbidity were noted. CONCLUSION: From the limited experience in four patients, navigation-guided radiofrequency kyphoplasty appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for sacral insufficiency fractures even though asymptomatic cement extravasation was noted. The use of navigation based on intraoperative 3 D images simplifies the positioning of the navigated bone needles via the long axis approach. The radiofrequency kyphoplasty system provides the possibility to administer a sufficient amount of bone cement with a well-defined viscosity over the entire period of the procedure leading to high security and low cement extravasation. Sacroplasty provides rapid and enduring pain relief and facilitates prompt mobilization.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven pathological vertebral fractures in nine patients were treated with vesselplasty (Vessel-X(R), MAXXSPINE). Nine of eleven vertebras (81.8 %) had major posterior wall deficiency (> 30 %). Clinical and radiological (CT) measures were obtained before and 3 months after the procedure. RESULTS: The mean VAS improved significantly from preoperative to postoperative (6.9 +/- 2.2 to 3.7 +/- 2.3; p < 0.05), as did the ODI (59.7 %+/- 19.2 % to 40.3 %+/- 24.0 %; p < 0.05). The physical component summary of the SF-36 was significantly improved by the operation (19.2 +/- 8.0 to 31.0 +/- 16.5; p < 0.05). Symptomatic cement leakage or other operation-associated complications were not observed. Three patients were primarily treated with concomitant minimally invasive stabilization via fixateur interne. One patient had to undergo minimally invasive stabilization via fixateur interne 4 months after vesselplasty due to further collapse of the treated vertebral body. CONCLUSION: From these preliminary results, vesselplasty appears to be a treatment option worth considering in pathological vertebral fractures, even in the case of posterior wall deficiency. Selected tumor patients might benefit from vesselplasty as a minimally invasive procedure for stabilization of the fractured vertebra, pain control, and improvement in body function and quality of life. Long-term prospective studies with a larger sample size are required to validate these results.",eng,0.0

Kallmes,2009.0,Clinical outcomes with hemivertebral filling during percutaneous vertebroplasty,10.3174/ajnr.A1416,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vertebroplasty has been commonly used for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. Practitioners usually attempt to maximize filling of the vertebral body with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), either by using a bipediculate approach with separate infusions in both hemivertebrae or by using a unipediculate approach with central needle placement that allows bilateral hemivertebral filling. This study serves to investigate the clinical efficacy of a unipediculate approach in which the cement injected does not cross the midline, with resultant hemivertebroplasty."" MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 917 vertebroplasty procedures was performed. A radiologic review of each vertebroplasty in the data base was performed to extract the vertebroplasties in which there was filling of only 1 side of the hemivertebra, which we term ""hemivertebroplasty."" Pre- and postoperative evaluations (1-week to 2-year postprocedure) included a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) scores, and information regarding new fractures and retreatment of augmented fractures. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the hemivertebroplasty cases and the bilaterally filled vertebroplasty group in reducing VAS or RDQ scores. Moreover, survival analysis showed no significant difference in the risk of incident fracture between groups (hazard ratio = 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-2.65). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our results, unilateral ""hemivertebroplasty"" is as effective in reducing pain with activity and at rest and decreasing the RDQ scores as bilateral vertebral filling. Additionally, vertebrae undergoing unilateral filling were at no greater risk of refracture or fracture of adjacent vertebrae than bilaterally filled vertebrae.""",eng,1.0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty for patients with traumatic nonosteoporotic compression fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 819 patients (982 procedures) who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty, to identify patients who had normal bone mineral densitometry scores or had no previous diagnosis of osteoporosis, multiple myeloma, or history of long-term steroid use. Follow-up evaluations included pain at rest and with activity (assessed with the visual analog scale [VAS]), medication use, and mobility. Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) scores were also collected. Statistical analysis included a 2-tailed t test comparing postprocedure outcomes with baseline values. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (53% women) were included. Mean age and t-score were 60 years and -0.35, respectively. We found significant improvements in the VAS scores, both at rest and with activity, and in the RDQ scores, starting at the 2-hour follow-up. Additionally, we found marked decreases in medication use and improvements in mobility. The complication rate was low and characterized by asymptomatic extravasation of cement. CONCLUSIONS: From our study, we have shown that vertebroplasty can be successfully and safely used in patients with traumatic nonosteoporotic compression fractures.

Patients were prospectively asked to quantify their pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) before and a day after PVP. The interval to mobilization was recorded in those who were immobilized because of pain and/or bed-rest therapy (115 cases). PVP was technically successful in all patients, with three cases of minimal complications. The mean VAS score available for 196 cases was improved from 7.22+/-1.89 (range, 3-10) to 2.07+/-1.19 (range, 0-10) by PVP.

We have developed and evaluated a simple puncture simulation method based on the puncture angle determined by preoperative computed tomography (CT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two groups were evaluated. The first (group A) comprised 23 patients (34 vertebral bodies) who had undergone PVP without preoperative puncture simulation before May 2004, and the second group (group B) comprised 24 patients (39 vertebral bodies) who had undergone preoperative puncture simulation and PVP after May 2004. CT in the prone position was performed, and the puncture angle on CT (PAC) via the vertebral arch pedicle targeting the anterior one-third median site of the vertebral body was determined. Puncture was performed by targeting the isocenter established on a fluoroscopic monitor based on the PAC. Determinations were made of the success rate (SR) of the median puncture of the vertebral body, the effect of treatment using the visual analogue score, and the overall procedural time between groups A and B. RESULTS: The SR was 56% (19/34 vertebral bodies) in group A, and 97% (37/38 vertebral bodies), including only one vertebral body in which it was difficult to perform the unilateral approach on CT images, in group B, with the difference being significant by Student's t-test (P < 0.001). Among patients with available follow-up data, the unipedicular and bipedicular approaches achieved adequate pain relief with mean decreases in pain severity of 5.1 +/- 2.6 and 5.9 +/- 2.8, respectively. No significant differences in the treatment effect between the two groups was observed (P = 0.811). The overall procedure time per puncture was shorten for the simulation group (36.0 min) than for group A (73.1 min), as shown by regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The preoperative PAC determination for PVP under fluoroscopy increased the completion rate of PVP by the unilateral transpedicular approach.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2002 to August 2004, PV was performed for osteoporotic compression fractures in 89 consecutive patients. All patients underwent PV for only fractured vertebrae. Between September 2004 and October 2006, we performed prophylactic cement injection for 155 patients, with cement injected into the non-fractured vertebra adjacent to the fractured vertebra, immediately above the fractured vertebra in the same procedure. We evaluated the frequency of new vertebral fractures and the efficacy of prophylactic therapy. RESULTS: In the non-prophylactic group, 15 of 89 patients (16.8%) developed new fractures within 3 months and 20 of 89 patients (22.4%) developed new painful compression fractures within a year after the first PV. These fractures occurred mostly in adjacent vertebra, particularly in the vertebra immediately superior to the treated one and occurred in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. In the prophylactic group, 7 of 155 patients (4.5%) developed new compression fractures within 3 months and 15 of 155 patients (9.7%) developed new compression fractures within 1 year. Statistical analysis showed that fewer new fractures developed in the prophylactic group than in the non-prophylactic group at both 3 months (P = .0020, Fisher's exact test) and 1 year (P = .0079).

Adequate visualization of PMMA during injection is desirable to minimize cement extravasation, so contrast agents such as barium sulfate are commonly added to the PMMA. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences of histology and radiographic visualization when different concentrations of barium sulfate are mixed with PMMA. Six sheep were utilized in this study. Three vertebrae of each animal were exposed via retroperitoneal approach, and a cavity was created and then filled with either 10% or 30% BaSO4/PMMA, or left empty. Vertebrae were harvested and analyzed radiographically and histologically 12 and 90 days after surgery. Average CT value of the 30% BaSO4/PMMA group was 2.4-fold higher than that of the 10% BaSO4/PMMA group. Foreign-body giant cells were recognized around BaSO4particles at 90 days in the 30% BaSO4 group, whereas few particles were recognized in the 10% group at 90 days, or in either group at 12 days. A very mild giant-cell reaction is induced by a higher concentration of BaSO4 in PMMA, but the marked improvement in cement visualization by increased BaSO4 may be important to minimize more serious complications of cement extravasation during PMMA injection.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After confirming the absence of safety issues in phase 1, a total of 33 cases were registered up to and including phase 2. Safety and efficacy were evaluated by National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria version 2 and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at 1 week after PVP. Based on VAS score decreases, efficacy was classified into significantly effective (SE; > or = 5 or reached 0-2), moderately effective (ME; 2-4), or ineffective (NE; <2 or increase).
RESULTS: Procedures were completed in all 33 patients (42 vertebrae). Thirty days after PVP, two patients died of primary disease progression, but no major adverse reactions (>grade 2) were observed. Response rate was 70% (95% confidence interval 54% to 83%) [61% (n = 20) with SE, 9% (n = 3) with ME, and 30% (n = 10) with NE] and increased to 83% at week 4. Median time to response was 1 day (mean 2.4). Median pain-mitigated survival period was 73 days.

Journal Article,C. A. Koch; K. F. Layton; D. F. Kallmes,2007.0,Outcomes of patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy who undergo percutaneous vertebroplasty,", ","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and rate of complications in patients undergoing percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for vertebral compression fractures as a result of secondary osteoporosis caused by long-term corticosteroid use compared with patients with primary osteoporosis treated with PVP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing PVP was conducted to identify patients who also received long-term corticosteroid therapy. Outcomes including pain, periprocedural complications, and frequency of new fractures in patients receiving corticosteroids were compared with control patients undergoing PVP for primary osteoporosis. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy underwent 79 PVP procedures. Patients treated with corticosteroids undergoing PVP were significantly younger and more likely to be male compared with control subjects. Patients receiving long-term corticosteroid treatment experienced significant pain relief immediately postprocedure and at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years postprocedure (P < .0001 at all time points). Patients receiving corticosteroids experienced similar decreases in pain from baseline compared with control subjects at all follow-up time points (P > .05). The complication rate for patients receiving corticosteroids was 4.4% compared with 3.4% for control subjects (P = .60). Patients on long-term corticosteroid treatment did not have an increased risk of new fractures after PVP compared with control subjects (P = .68). CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty performed for vertebral compression fractures as a result of long-term corticosteroid therapy is as safe and effective in relieving pain as PVP performed in patients with vertebral compression fractures as a result of primary osteoporosis.",eng,1.0

Ferguson,2016.0,In silico investigation of vertebroplasty as a stand-alone treatment for vertebral burst fractures,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2016.03.008,"BACKGROUND: The use of percutaneous vertebroplasty as a stand-alone treatment for stable vertebral burst fractures has been investigated in vitro and in clinical studies. These studies present inconsistent results on the mechanical response of vertebroplasty-treated burst fractures. In addition, observations of the loss of sagittal alignment after vertebroplasty raise questions on the applicability of vertebroplasty for burst fractures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical stability of burst fractures after stand-alone treatment by vertebroplasty. METHODS: Finite element simulations were performed with models generated from two laboratory-induced burst fractures in human thoracolumbar specimens. The burst fracture models were virtually injected with various cement volumes using a unipedicular or bipedicular approach. The models were subjected to four individual loads (compression, lateral bending, extension and torsion) and a multi-axial load case in the physiological range. FINDINGS: All treated burst fractures showed improvements in stiffness and a reduction in inter-fragmentary displacements, thus potentially providing a suitable mechanical environment for fracture healing. However, large volumes of the trabecular bone (<43%), cement (<53%) and bone-cement composite (<58%) were predicted to experience strain levels exceeding the yield point. While damage was not specifically modeled, this implies a potential collapse of the treated vertebra due to local failure. INTERPRETATION: To improve the primary stability and to prevent the collapse of treated burst fractures, the use of posterior instrumentation is suggested as an adjunct to vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

Choi,2007.0,Vertebroplasty: magnetic resonance findings related to cement leakage risk,10.1080/02841850601161554,"PURPOSE: To find magnetic resonance (MR) findings predicting cement leakage in patients receiving percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) due to osteoporotic compression fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MR was done in 43 patients (age 52-89 years) before PVP (56 vertebrae), which was done via a bipedicular approach with fluoroscopic monitoring. Shortly after the procedure, a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was done at the vertebroplasty sites for evaluation of bone cement leakage. The following MR findings of fractured vertebral bodies were retrospectively reviewed for correlation with leakage risk: severity of bone-marrow edema, presence of a T2-weighted low-signal-intensity line, percentage residual vertebral body height, presence of either a vacuum or cystic change within the vertebral body, and presence of a cortical disruption. RESULTS: After PVP, cement leakage was detected in 35 vertebrae (62.5%). Leakage was most frequently observed in the anterior external vertebral venous plexus (46%). Cement leakage rate increased when there was a cortical disruption (P = 0.037), especially at the endplates, while it decreased when there was a vacuum or a cystic change within the fractured vertebra (P = 0.019). Other MR findings were not related to the risk of cement leakage. CONCLUSION: The risk of cement leakage in PVP increases when MR shows cortical disruption in a fractured vertebral body, especially at the endplates. It decreases when MR shows a vacuum or cystic change within the body.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2008 to October 2010, vertebroplasty for single-level osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with clefts was performed in 34 patients (seven women, 27 men; mean age, 77 y) with CIVAS and in 41 patients (three women, 38 men; mean age, 77 y) by conventional injection (control group). In this retrospective study, the cement volume, cement ratio, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, and incidences of leakage, new vertebral compression fracture, and nonhealing were compared between groups. Vertebral height changes in the CIVAS group were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were significant decreases in VAS scores in both groups (P < .001). There were no significant differences in complications between groups (cement leakage, P = .70; new vertebral compression fracture, P = .17; nonhealing, P = .086). Vertebral height was significantly decreased by vacuum aspiration and increased by cement injection (P < .001). The mean cement volume was significantly higher (P = .0057) in the CIVAS group (4.87 mL) than in the control group (3.58 mL). Cement filling was achieved more sufficiently in the CIVAS group (P = .014).

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether augmentation with low stiffness cement can decrease the risk of adjacent-level fractures in low-quality bone. METHODS: Eighteen female osteoporotic lumbar specimens (L1-L5) were harvested and divided into three groups according to bone mineral density: (I) native; (II) PMMA; (III) modified PMMA (lower stiffness). For the PMMA and modified PMMA groups, a compression fracture was first mechanically induced in L3, and then the fracture received vertebroplasty treatment. The cement stiffness reduction of the modified PMMA group was achieved via an addition of 8 mL of serum to the typical PMMA base. All specimens were exposed to cyclic loading (4 Hz) and a stepwise increasing applied peak force. Cement stiffness was tested according to ISO 5833. RESULTS: A 51% decrease in cement stiffness was achieved in the modified PMMA group (954 +/- 141 vs. 1,937 +/- 478 MPa, p < 0.001). Fatigue fracture force (the force level during cyclic loading at which the deformation experienced a sudden increase; FFF) was significantly affected by bone quality (r (2) = 0.39, p = 0.006) and by the initial fracture force (the force necessary to create the initial fracture in L3 prior to augmentation; r (2) = 0.82, p < 0.001). Using initial fracture force as a covariate, the FFF of the modified PMMA group (1,764 +/- 49 N) was significantly higher than in the PMMA group (1,544 +/- 55 N; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: A possible method to reduce adjacent-level fractures after vertebroplasty in patients with reduced bone quality could be the use of a lower modulus cement. Therefore, mixing cement with biocompatible fluids could prove useful to tailor cement properties in the operating theater.",eng,0.0

Lehmann,2015.0,[Cement augmentation on the spine : Biomechanical considerations],10.1007/s00132-015-3134-8,"BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures. Since the introduction of vertebroplasty and screw augmentation, the management of osteoporotic fractures has changed significantly. AIMS: The biomechanical characteristics of the risk of adjacent fractures and novel treatment modalities for osteoporotic vertebral fractures, including pure cement augmentation by vertebroplasty, and cement augmentation of screws for posterior instrumentation, are explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen human osteoporotic lumbar spines (L1-5) adjacent to vertebral bodies after vertebroplasty were tested in a servo-hydraulic machine. As augmentation compounds we used standard cement and a modified low-strength cement. Different anchoring pedicle screws were tested with and without cement augmentation in another cohort of human specimens with a simple pull-out test and a fatigue test that better reflects physiological conditions. RESULTS: Cement augmentation in the osteoporotic spine leads to greater biomechanical stability. However, change in vertebral stiffness resulted in alterations with the risk of adjacent fractures. By using a less firm cement compound, the risk of adjacent fractures is significantly reduced. Both screw augmentation techniques resulted in a significant increase in the withdrawal force compared with the group without cement. Augmentation using perforated screws showed the highest stability in the fatigue test. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The augmentation of cement leads to a significant change in the biomechanical properties. Differences in the stability of adjacent vertebral bodies increase the risk of adjacent fractures, which could be mitigated by a modified cement compound with reduced strength. Screws that were specifically designed for cement application displayed greatest stability in the fatigue test.",ger,0.0

METHODS: Initially, we enrolled 104 consecutive patients with vertebral compression fractures caused by osteoporosis. A total of 83 of the 104 patients visited our hospital for follow-up examinations for more than 4 weeks after vertebroplasty. Logistic regression analysis of the data obtained from these 83 patients was used to determine relative risks of recurrent compression fractures, using 13 different factors. RESULTS: We identified 59 new fractures in 30 of the 83 patients: 41 new fractures in vertebrae adjacent to treated vertebrae; and 18 new fractures in vertebrae not adjacent to treated vertebrae. New fractures occurred in vertebrae adjacent to treated vertebrae significantly more frequently than in vertebrae not adjacent to treated vertebrae. Only cement leakage into the disk was a significant predictor of new vertebral body fracture after vertebroplasty (odds ratio = 4.633). None of the following covariates were associated with increased risk of new fracture: age, gender, bone mineral density, the number of vertebroplasty procedures, the number of vertebrae treated per procedure, the cumulative number of vertebrae treated, the presence of a single untreated vertebra between treated vertebrae, the presence of multiple untreated vertebrae between treated vertebrae, the amount of bone cement injected per procedure, the cumulative amount of bone cement injected, cement leakage into the soft tissue around the vertebra, and cement leakage into the vein.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups, the 1-mL syringe group and the bone cement injector group. Percutaneous vertebroplasties were performed with the IVR-CT system, which combines angiographic and CT equipment with a single fluoroscopy table. Radiation dose to operators was measured as equivalent dose penetrating at a 10-mm tissue depth with use of electronic personal dosimeters attached outside and inside lead aprons. Effective radiation dose (HE) was estimated based on the radiation dose outside the lead apron (Ha) and the radiation dose inside the lead apron (Hb). Differences between the groups in doses and fluoroscopic duration were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 1-mL syringe group and bone cement injector group, mean Ha measurements were 320.8 microSv and 116.2 microSv, respectively. Mean Hb measurements were 14.5 microSv versus 7.8 microSv and mean HE measurements were 48.2 microSv versus 19.7 microSv. Significant differences were found in Ha, Hb, and HE. However, duration of fluoroscopy did not differ significantly between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation dose was relatively high for operators performing percutaneous vertebroplasty. The bone cement injector was useful in reducing the level of radiation exposure to operators during vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 49 consecutive patients, with 104 vertebral body compression fractures, who underwent percutaneous injection of bone cement. Vertebral body volume was measured by CT volumetry. The patient's pain level was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) before and after the procedure. Improvement in VAS was defined as the decrease in VAS after the procedure. Relationships between vertebral body volume, the amount of bone cement, and the effect of treatment were evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient test. RESULTS: Average vertebral body volume was 26.3 +/- 8.1 cm3; average amount of bone cement was 3.2 +/- 1.1 ml; and average improvement in VAS was 4.9 +/- 2.7. The vertebral body volume was greater if a larger amount of bone cement was injected. There was a significant positive correlation between vertebral body volume and amount of bone cement (r = 0.44; P < 0.0001). However, there was no correlation between vertebral body volume and improvement in VAS, or between amount of bone cement and improvement in VAS. CONCLUSION: In percutaneous vertebroplasty for vertebral body compression fracture, there is a positive correlation between vertebral body volume and amount of bone cement, but improvement in VAS does not correlate with vertebral body volume or amount of bone cement.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Initially, we enrolled 30 consecutive patients with vertebral compression fractures caused by osteoporosis. Twenty-three of the 30 patients visited our hospital for follow-up examinations for more than 4 weeks after vertebroplasty. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with new fractures (group F) and patients with no new fractures (group N). We analyzed differences in the following parameters between these two groups: serum bone alkaline phosphatase, urinary crosslinked N-telopeptide of type I collagen, urinary deoxypyridinoline, and bone mineral density. Next, the patients were divided into another two groups: patients with higher risk (group H: urinary crosslinked N-telopeptide of type I collagen >54.3 nmol BCE/mmol Cr or urinary deoxypyridinoline >7.6 nmol/mmol Cr, and serum bone alkaline phosphatase <29.0 U/l) and patients with lower risk (group L). We analyzed the difference in the rate of new fractures between these two groups. RESULTS: We identified 9 new fractures in 7 patients. There were no significant differences between groups F and N. We identified 5 new fractures in 3 of the 4 patients in group H, and 4 new fractures in 4 of the 19 patients in group L. There was a significant difference in the rate of new fractures between groups H and L.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to review patients with a single-level osteoporotic VCF treated by VP or KP. Intravertebral clefts were assessed by preoperative computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance scans. All enrolled patients were followed up for 12 months. Clinical outcomes, radiological findings and complications were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients were available for data analysis. Most of the fractures (75.5 %) occurred in the region of the thoracolumbar junction (T10-L2). Twenty-four patients received VP and 29 patients received KP. Patients in both group had significant pain relief after surgery (P < 0.01). Compared with VP group, there was a significant lower visual analogue scale (VAS) score in KP group at the 6- (P = 0.04) and 12-month follow-up (P = 0.02), but the decreased values of VAS score had no significant correlation with the magnitude of deformity correction. Restoration of vertebral body height and reduction in kyphotic angle were achieved in both groups, and the magnitude of correction was more significant in KP group (P < 0.01). Cement leakage rate in VP group (66.7 %) was higher than that in KP group (20.7 %), and there was a significant difference (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Intravertebral clefts occur primarily at the thoracolumbar junction and can be detected easily by CT and magnetic resonance imaging scans. Both VP and KP are effective in the treatment of clefts, but patients in KP group tend to have a better pain relief at the medium and long-term follow-up.

Long-term studies, however, are still not available focusing on the effect of possible acceleration of intervertebral disc degeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients (average age 67.1 +/- 6.9 years, range 58-77; 10 female, 5 male) with acute or osteoporotic fractures were included in this study and MRI scans were performed before surgery and after a mean follow-up period of 15.2 months (range 8-27 months). Out of these patients, seven were available for a long-term MRI scan after a mean of 94.3 months (range 84-96 months). Disc degeneration and injuries were graded according to published Pfirrmann and Oner scales. RESULTS: A total of 43 intervertebral discs with moderate initial degeneration were examined pre-operatively and at the first follow-up. Twenty were available for the long-term-follow-up. At the first follow-up, 3 (1.3 %) discs showed a degenerative progression of 1 grade compared to the pre-operative MRI. Only one injured and one uninjured disc (0.4 %) showed progressive degeneration of 1 grade in the long-term follow up. No intervertebral disc in-between bisegmental cement augmentation showed acceleration of degenerative changes. CONCLUSION: Despite several limitations regarding patients' age and lack of performed perfusion MRI scans, this study suggests that vertebral cement augmentation through kyphoplasty has no significant influence on disc degeneration even after a long period. The absence of severe disc degeneration after vertebral augmentation supports further clinical trials, which should incorporate endplate perfusion studies for detailed information regarding disc perfusion.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of minimal invasive surgery for acute lumbar fractures by means of balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate plus segmental short posterior instrumented fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In the surgical treatment of lumbar fractures with short pedicle screw instrumentation, the failure to support the anterior spinal column often results in loss of correction. Transpedicular augmentation techniques with bone and bone substitutes have been attempted whereas kyphoplasty has been increasingly used to augment fractured vertebral body. METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients with an average age of 64 +/- 15 years, who sustained lumbar (L1-L4) burst and severe compression fracture were included in this prospective study. On admission, 2 (11%) of 18 patients had incomplete neurologic impairment. All patients underwent bilateral balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate bone cement to reduce segmental kyphosis and restore vertebral body height and segmental pedicle screw instrumentation and fusion. Gardner kyphosis angle, anterior (AVBHr) and posterior vertebral body height ratio (PVBHr), and spinal canal encroachment (SCE) were calculated before to after surgery. VAS and SF-36 were used to evaluate functional outcome. RESULTS: All patients were operated within 24 hours after admission and were followed for an average 22 months (17-28 months) after index surgery. Operating time and blood loss averaged 45 minutes and 70 mL, respectively. VAS and SF-36 (role physical and bodily pain domains) were significantly improved after surgery. Both patients with incomplete neurologic lesions recovered, whereas no neurologic deterioration was observed in any case. Segmental kyphosis improved from an average preoperative kyphosis of 16 to 2 degrees after surgery (P < 0.000). AVBHr improved from an average before surgery 0.57 to 0.87 (P < 0.000) after surgery, whereas PVBHr improved from 0.93 before surgery to 0.98 (P < 0.05) after surgery. SCE was reduced from an average 25% before surgery to 19% (P < 0.07) after surgery. Bone cement leakage was observed anteriorly to the fractured vertebral body or to the adjacent superior disc in 4 patients without clinical sequelae, whereas 3 pedicle screws were malpositioned medially to the pedicle in 3 patients without neurologic impairment or associated complaints. Posterolateral radiologic fusion was achieved within 6 to 8 months after index operation. There was no instrumentation failure or loss of sagittal curve and vertebral height correction. CONCLUSION: Balloon kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate cement combined with posterior segmental short minimal invasive fixation for fresh burst and severe compression lumbar fractures provided excellent immediate reduction of post-traumatic segmental kyphosis with simultaneous reduction of spinal canal encroachment and restoration of vertebral body height in the fracture level.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: This study compares the efficacy in sagittal vertebral height and wedge deformity restoration, polymethylmethacrylate cement leakage safety, and functional outcome of balloon kyphoplasty (BK) versus KIVA (a novel vertebral augmentation technique) implant for the augmentation of fresh osteoporotic vertebral body fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive vertebral augmentation procedures have been widely used to treat vertebral compression fractures caused by osteoporosis. The results of these trials are encouraging in augmenting the vertebra and reducing the wedge deformity. However, after BK, polymethylmethacrylate leakage remains common after A3.1 AO type fractures, with a frequency per vertebra into the epidural space up to 9.8% but less common (0.03%-5.6%) in A1.1 AO type fracture. KIVA is a novel percutaneous uniportal vertebral augmentation device that is designed to restore the vertebral body and reduce polymethylmethacrylate leakage. METHODS: From a total 190 patients with osteoporotic fractures who were initially enrolled in this prospective randomized study, 10 patients were excluded (5 met exclusion criteria, 5 with evidence of metastasis). This study examined 82 patients (69 +/- 11 yr) with 133 fractures who received KIVA and 86 patients (72 +/- 9 yr) with 122 fractures that were reinforced with BK. Anterior (anterior vertebral body height ratio [AVBHr]), midline (midline vertebral body height ratio [MVBHr]), and posterior (posterior vertebral body height ratio [PVBHr]) vertebral body height ratio and Gardner segmental vertebral wedge deformity were measured preoperatively to postoperatively. New fractures were recorded at the final observation. The baseline anthropometric and roentgenographic parameters did not differ between the 2 groups. Any cement leakage was examined on plain roentgenograms and computed tomographic scan. All patients were followed for an average of 14 months (range, 13-15 mo) postoperatively. RESULTS.: At the final observation, both KIVA and BK restored significantly AVBHr, PVBHr, and MVBHr. However, only KIVA device reduced significantly the Gardner angle (P = 0.002). Residual kyphosis of more than 5 degrees was measured significantly more (P < 0.001) in the BK than in KIVA spines.

OBJECTIVE: This study compares the efficacy in sagittal vertebral height and wedge deformity restoration, polymethylmethacrylate cement leakage safety, and functional outcome of balloon kyphoplasty (BK) versus KIVA (a novel vertebral augmentation technique) implant for the augmentation of fresh osteoporotic vertebral body fractures.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive vertebral augmentation procedures have been widely used to treat vertebral compression fractures caused by osteoporosis. The results of these trials are encouraging in augmenting the vertebra and reducing the wedge deformity. However, after BK, polymethylmethacrylate leakage remains common after A3.1 AO type fractures, with a frequency per vertebra into the epidural space up to 9.8% but less common (0.03%-5.6%) in A1.1 AO type fracture. KIVA is a novel percutaneous uniportal vertebral augmentation device that is designed to restore the vertebral body and reduce polymethylmethacrylate leakage.
METHODS: From a total 190 patients with osteoporotic fractures who were initially enrolled in this prospective randomized study, 10 patients were excluded (5 met exclusion criteria, 5 with evidence of metastasis). This study examined 82 patients (69 +/- 11 yr) with 133 fractures who received KIVA and 86 patients (72 +/- 9 yr) with 122 fractures that were reinforced with BK. Anterior (anterior vertebral body height ratio [AVBHr]), midline (midline vertebral body height ratio [MVBHr]), and posterior (posterior vertebral body height ratio [PVBHr]) vertebral body height ratio and Gardner segmental vertebral wedge deformity were measured preoperatively to postoperatively. New fractures were recorded at the final observation. The baseline anthropometric and roentgenographic parameters did not differ between the 2 groups. Any cement leakage was examined on plain roentgenograms and computed tomographic scan. All patients were followed for an average of 14 months (range, 13-15 mo) postoperatively. RESULTS.: At the final observation, both KIVA and BK restored significantly AVBHr, PVBHr, and MVBHr. However, only KIVA device reduced significantly the Gardner angle (P = 0.002). Residual kyphosis of more than 5degree was measured significantly more (P < 0.001) in the BK than in KIVA spines. KIVA showed significantly lower (3%, chi2, P <= 0.05) leakage) [corrected] (paravertebral, intradiscal) rate per vertebra than BK (0.098%) in which because of intracanal leakage 2 patients developed acute paraplegia and were reoperated in emergency. New fracture rate was similar in both groups. Back pain scores (visual analogue scale), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (Physical Function and Mental Health domains), and Oswestry Disability Index scores improved significantly in the patients of both groups.

Extracanal leakage of both low-viscosity PMMA and calcium phosphate (CP) as well as the following roentgenographic parameters: segmental kyphosis (SKA), anterior (AVBHr) and posterior (PVBHr) vertebral body height ratio, spinal canal encroachment (SCE) clearance, and functional outcome measures: VAS and SF-36, were recorded and compared between the two groups. All patients in both groups were followed for a minimum 26 (Group A) and 25 (Group B) months. Extracanal CP and PMMA leakage was observed in four (18 %) and three (15 %) vertebrae/patients of group A and B, respectively. Hybrid fixation improved AVBHr, SKA, SCE, but PVBHr only in group B. VAS and SF-36 improved postoperatively in the patients of both groups. Short-segment construct with the novel KIVA implant restored better than BK-fractured lumbar vertebral body, but this had no impact in functional outcome.

Comparison of 2 percutaneous minimal invasive spine techniques: a prospective randomized controlled short-term study,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/BRS.0000000000000112,"STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, parallel-group, controlled, comparative randomized study.
OBJECTIVE: To compare cement leakage rate and efficacy for vertebral body restoration of balloon kyphoplasty (BK) versus Kiva novel implant with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) for treating osteolytic vertebral body metastasis.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasively vertebral augmentation techniques with PMMA are mostly performed for treating osteoporotic compression fractures. The Kiva implant with PMMA offers better vertebral body restoration and less PMMA leakage than BK in osteoporotic fractures. No previous study compared leakage rate and efficacy for vertebral body restoration in traditional BK and Kiva with PMMA in osteolytic vertebral body metastases.
METHODS: This study examined 23 patients (71 +/- 13 yr) with 41 osteolytic vertebral bodies, who received Kiva with low viscosity PMMA and 24 patients (70 +/- 11 yr) with 43 vertebral body osteolyses, who were reinforced with BK and high viscosity PMMA. All osteolyses were graded as Tomita 1 to 3. Anterior vertebral body height ratio (AVBHr), posterior vertebral body height ratio (PVBHr), and middle vertebral body height ratio (MVBHr), Gardner kyphotic deformity, PMMA leakage and were measured and compared between the groups. Visual analogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index were used for functional outcome evaluation.
RESULTS: No patient survived after 3 months. Asymptomatic PMMA leakage occurred in 4 (9.3%) vertebrae in the BK group solely (2 to the spinal canal, in Tomita grade 3 osteolysis) Anterior, posterior and middle vertebral body height ratio, Gardner angle improved insignificantly in both groups. Visual anlogue scale and Oswestry Disability Index improved postoperatively similarly in both groups (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: BK and Kiva provided equally significant spinal pain relief in patients with cancer with osteolytic metastasis. The absence of cement leakage in the Kiva group and absence of neurological complication in the BK group leakages reflects the safety of both augmentation techniques even in significant osteolysis. The lack of cement leakage in the Kiva cases, although low viscosity PMMA was used, increases this implant safety in augmenting severely destructed thoracolumbar vertebrae and sacrum from osteolytic metastasis.

OBJECTIVES: To define the evolution of vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) at kyphoplasty and adjacent levels along with sagittal spinal alignment to contribute to the etiology of adjacent vertebral fractures after augmentation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporotic compression fractures can be effectively treated with methylmethacrylate vertebral augmentation. However, to the authors' knowledge the effect of vertebral augmentation on the vertebral endplate BMD of the augmented and adjacent nonaugmented levels has not as yet been described. METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive selected patients (9 men, 18 women), with an average age of 72+/-9 years underwent 1, 2, or 3-level percutaneous kyphoplasty for painful fresh osteoporotic vertebral fractures at the thoracolumbar spine. All patients were radiologically examined with plain roentgenograms, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Lateral dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in the augmented and on the adjacent vertebrae (1 level above and below kyphoplasty) was used to measure BMD preoperatively to the last postoperative observation in the subchondral bone of the vertebral endplates. Anthropometric data, sagittal global balance (plumbline), and segmental spine reconstruction (vertebral body height, Gardner kyphotic angle) were recorded and analyzed. The patients were followed for at least 2 years. RESULTS: Kyphoplasty was performed between T12 and L5. A total of 48 vertebral bodies were augmented. Thirteen patients received 1 level and the remaining 14 received 2 or 3-level kyphoplasty. No significant changes in the sagittal spinal balance were shown postoperatively. Gardner kyphotic angle and posterior vertebral body height improved postoperatively, however, insignificantly. Significant [analysis of variance (ANOVA), P=0.008] increase of anterior vertebral body height in the fractured vertebra was achieved postoperatively without subsequent loss of correction. BMD increased significantly in the lower endplate of the augmented vertebra (ANOVA, P=0.05). In 1-level augmentation, no BMD changes were shown at the adjacent vertebrae above and below kyphoplasty. On the contrary, in the multilevel augmentation, a statistically significant (ANOVA, P=0.05) decrease of the BMD was shown in the upper endplate of the adjacent level above kyphoplasty. During the 2-year follow-up, there were 5 (18%) new fractures at the T11-T12 area above the augmented vertebra. All of the fractures occurred in patients who received 2 and 3-level kyphoplasty. CONCLUSIONS: The observed 2-year evolution of vertebral endplate BMD, after kyphoplasty under stable global sagittal spinal balance, might contribute to the pathogenesis of new fractures in adjacent vertebra. However, other studies with control series and longer follow-up are necessary to show if these BMD changes are the result of vertebral augmentation or are merely natural history.",eng,0.0

The purpose of this study is to present our experience with the Roy-Camille instrumentation for posterior cervical stabilization after injury in a long-term follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1985 to 1995, 76 patients with a lower cervical spine traumatic lesion were treated in a single institution by posterior plate stabilization using the Roy-Camille plates (R-C plates). Fifty-four men and 22 women with a mean age of 43.2 years were involved. In 59 patients the injuries were due to a road traffic accident, in 14 cases the fall from a high was responsible, while in two cases the injuries were due to sport activities. There were four bilateral dislocations, nine unilateral dislocations, 56 fracture dislocations, five fracture separations of a lateral mass and two burst fractures. Neurological lesions were present in 65 patients (9 ASIA A, 16 ASIA B, 22 ASIA C, 18 ASIA D and 11 ASIA E). All patients had minimum follow-up of 7 years. Fifty-nine patients were followed up for a mean period of 21 years (14-27 years). RESULTS: Stability was obtained in all but two cases. Reoperation was done in two cases: in one for the correction of the lost reduction and in a second for the reinsertion of a screw irritating a nerve root. No case in the ASIA A group showed neurological improvement, a fact observed in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The R-C plates were used in the last quarter of the last century. This technique showed good short-time results, and we have shown good results in a long-term follow-up as well. The literature referred to this technique was favorable, as far as the biomechanical behavior and also clinical application concern.

METHODS: A retrospective multicenter analysis of consecutive patients undergoing CT-guided sacroplasty for painful sacral insufficiency fractures or sacral lesions was undertaken. The inclusion criteria consisted of severe sacral pain not responding to conservative medical management with imaging evidence of unilateral or bilateral sacral insufficiency fractures or lesions. Outcome measures included hospitalization status (inpatient or outpatient), pre-treatment and post-treatment visual analog scale (VAS) scores, analgesic use and complications. Patients were followed at approximately 1 month and for at least 1 year after their sacroplasty procedure. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-three patients were included in the study, 204 with painful sacral insufficiency fractures and 39 with symptomatic sacral lesions. The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.2+/-1.1 was significantly improved after sacroplasty to 1.9+/-1.7 in patients with sacral insufficiency fractures (p<0.001). The average pre-treatment VAS score of 9.0+/-0.9 in patients with sacral lesions was significantly improved after sacroplasty to 2.6+/-2.4 (p<0.001). There were no major complications or procedure-related deaths. One patient who was treated for a sacral insufficiency fracture experienced radicular pain due to local extravasation of cement that subsequently required surgical decompression for symptomatic relief.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with primary multiple myeloma were treated for symptomatic compression fractures between June 2003 and June 2005. Kyphoplasty was applied to 22 levels in 18 and vertebroplasty to 28 levels in 16 patients. The pain-related disability was evaluated for every single daily living activity using visual analog scale (VAS) over 10 points. (pain at rest, walking, sitting-standing, taking a shower and wearing clothes). (This evaluation is performed to every patient with degenerative disorders of the spine upon admission to our clinic.) Overall VAS scores were evaluated over 50 points (0 minimum, 50 maximum) preoperatively, at postoperative six weeks, six months and at one year prior to taking analgesics. The amount of analgesic use was recorded. Data was analyzed statistically using variance analysis, Friedman's multiple comparison test and Student's t test. RESULTS: The mean overall pain score in the kyphoplasty group decreased from a preoperative value of 36 to 12.13 at the sixth postoperative week, to 8.63 at the sixth month and to 9.72 at one year. (p<0.001). The mean overall pain score in the vertebroplasty group decreased from a preoperative value of 37.83 to 15.33 at the sixth postoperative week, to 12.17 at sixth months and to 13.47 at one year. (p<0.001). Student's t test was used to analyze the percentage of differences in overall pain score. Difference between groups was not statistically significant at the sixth week (p=0.106) but was statistically significant both at the sixth month (p=0.024) and at one year (p=0.027) in favor of kyphoplasty group. No secondary collapse was observed in adjacent levels in both groups. There were no intrapostoperative neurologic/pulmonary complications in both groups. Analgesics usage significantly decreased in both groups. CONCLUSION: In multiple myeloma, when pathological spinal compression fractures cause intractable pain and are unresponsive to conservative treatment, both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are effective in increasing quality of life and decreasing pain.",eng,1.0

Journal Article,Z. Kotwica; A. Saracen,2011.0,Early and long-term outcomes of vertebroplasty for single osteoporotic fractures,", ","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a minimally invasive vertebral augmentation procedure for the treatment of recent, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The aim of the study was to determine the early and late outcomes of PVP for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively assessed outcomes of PVP in 200 patients with single, osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. Follow-up assessment was made 12 hours after surgery as well as after 7 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. A subgroup of 80 patients was evaluated also 2 years after PVP. A 100-mm visual analogue scale of pain was used for outcome measurement. RESULTS: Twelve hours after PVP, very significant relief of pain was obtained in 85% of patients; on the 7th and 30th day a very good result of treatment was noted in 96%. The same result was noted in 92% of patients at the 6th month, and in 90% of patients at the 12th month. Among the 80 patients followed for 2 years, 3 patients reported recurrence of pain and were subsequently diagnosed with new osteoporotic fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive method of treatment for fresh osteoporotic fractures, which provides a significant and sizeable reduction of pain in the short as well as long term after surgery. Complete relief of pain was noted 12 hours after PVP in 94% of patients, and was noted in 90% two years after treatment. Despite some literature data suggesting no beneficial effect of PVP, it can be concluded that PVP is the most effective and the safest method for fresh vertebral compression fracture treatment.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,C. S.

RECENT FINDINGS: When vertebral fractures occur in pregnant or lactating women, it is usually unknown whether the skeleton was normal before pregnancy. Maternal adaptations increase bone resorption modestly during pregnancy but markedly during lactation. The net bone loss may occasionally precipitate fractures, especially in women who have underlying low bone mass or skeletal fragility prior to pregnancy. Bone mass and strength are normally restored postweaning. Transient osteoporosis of the hip is a sporadic disorder localized to one or both femoral heads; it is not due to generalized skeletal resorption. Anecdotal reports have used bisphosphonates, strontium ranelate, teriparatide, or vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty to treat postpartum vertebral fractures, but it is unclear whether these therapies had any added benefit over the spontaneous skeletal recovery that normally occurs after weaning. SUMMARY: These relatively rare fragility fractures result from multifactorial causes, including skeletal disorders that precede pregnancy, and structural and metabolic stresses that can compromise skeletal strength during pregnancy and lactation. Further study is needed to determine when pharmacological or surgical therapy is warranted instead of conservative or expectant management.",eng,0.0

Ralston,2015.0,Presentation and management of osteoporosis presenting in association with pregnancy or lactation,10.1007/s00198-015-3149-3,"In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the pathophysiology of fragility fractures that occur for the first time during pregnancy and lactation, and provide guidance on appropriate investigations and treatment strategies. Most affected women will have had no prior bone density reading, and so the extent of bone loss that may have occurred during pregnancy or lactation is uncertain. During pregnancy, intestinal calcium absorption doubles in order to meet the fetal demand for calcium, but if maternal intake of calcium is insufficient to meet the combined needs of the mother and baby, the maternal skeleton will undergo resorption during the third trimester. During lactation, several hormonal changes, independent of maternal calcium intake, program a 5-10 % loss of trabecular mineral content in order to provide calcium to milk. After weaning the baby, the maternal skeleton is normally restored to its prior mineral content and strength. This physiological bone resorption during reproduction does not normally cause fractures; instead, women who do fracture are more likely to have additional secondary causes of bone loss and fragility. Transient osteoporosis of the hip may affect one or both femoral heads during pregnancy but it involves localized edema and not skeletal resorption. Case reports have described the use of calcitonin, bisphosphonates, strontium ranelate, teriparatide, vertebroplasty, and kyphoplasty to treat post-partum vertebral fractures. However, the need for such treatments is uncertain given that a progressive increase in bone mass subsequently occurs in most women who present with a fracture during pregnancy or lactation.",eng,0.0

CONTRAINDICATIONS: Osteoporotic fractures which are suitable for nonoperative treatment or percutaneous cement augmentation techniques (vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty). Vertebral body fractures in patients with good bone quality. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Insertion of pedicle screws in a typical manner. If perforated screws are used, cement application under fluoroscopic control via the central perforation of the screws. If pedicle screws without perforation are used, application of the cement using a Kyphoplasty technique and insertion of the screws. After hardening of the cement, completion of the instrumentation.

Intravertebral clefts were identified on conventional radiographs, MR or CT images as gas- or fluid-filled spaces adjacent to an endplate of a fractured vertebra. Forty-four vertebrae showed intravertebral clefts. All clefts were filled with PMMA showing a typical filling pattern. Due to the prone positioning of the patient during vertebroplasty, a significant reduction of the kyphosis angle was achieved in the cleft group. Cement leakage occurred in 18.2% of clefts and 46% of regular osteoporotic fractures. In all patients, good filling of the cleft was achieved no matter where the needle tip was placed in the vertebra. The VAS score was 9.1 preoperatively, 3.6 before discharge and 3.9 6 months postoperatively, showing no significant difference between both groups.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the range of injection pressures during conventional vertebroplasty interventions and to study the influence of syringe design and cement polymerization time on injection pressure. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is an efficient procedure for the treatment of painful vertebral fractures. However, cement leakage is a potentially serious complication. Although injection pressure has been suggested as a factor for extravasation risk, to date, there are only anecdotal reports of pressure data for cement augmentation in the clinic. METHODS: Using a syringe holder instrumented with load and displacement transducers, injection pressure and volume were recorded in vivo during conventional cement augmentation. Wide (3 mm opening) and normal (1.8 mm opening) syringes were alternated such that each type was evaluated for early (300-500 seconds postmixing) and late (>500 seconds postmixing) cement polymerization time. The influence of syringe type and polymerization time on injection pressure was evaluated using a multifactorial analysis of variance followed by Scheffe post hoc comparison. RESULTS: The maximum peak injection pressure measured was 3215 kPa. The average pressure peaks for normal and wide syringes were 1693 +/- 653 kPa and 1727 +/- 597 kPa, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between injection pressures with wide and normal syringes. Higher injection pressures were observed later in the polymerization process. CONCLUSIONS: High injection pressures approaching 20 atmospheres are reached during conventional vertebroplasty. Widening the syringe tip diameter did not significantly change injection pressures, whereas elapsed time did. Further research is needed to improve injection equipment and materials for vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

With the technique of kyphoplasty (Kyphon) it is feasible to correct a kyphotic deformity. Inflatable balloons are introduced to the vertebra to lift the endplates. The created cavity is filled with bone cement (PMMA). DISCUSSION: Kyphoplasty is able to correct osteoporosis induced kyphotic deformity. Compared to the technique of vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty is less risky but is more time consuming and more expensive. Time will show whether the expected advantage of deformity correction will result in a better outcome for the patient, e. g. in a lower incidence of refractures.""",ger,0.0

Lenke,2015.0,"Sternum-Into-Abdomen"" Deformity With Abdominal Compression Following Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fractures Managed By 2-Level Vertebral Column Resection and Reconstruction""",10.1097/brs.0000000000001004,"STUDY DESIGN: A unique case report. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of severe thoracolumbar kyphosis with abdominal compression causing gastric disturbance after treatment of an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture and its ultimate management by vertebral column resection (VCR). We propose a new terminology sternum-into-abdomen deformity"" to describe this condition. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Management of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures mainly aims at pain control and deformity reduction. VCR for decreasing abdominal compression due to the development of severe kyphosis after treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures has never been reported in the literature to our knowledge. METHODS: This is a case report on a single patient. The hospital and office charts were reviewed. Reports of prior treatment of his compression fracture were analyzed. RESULTS: This 73-year-old cachectic patient underwent vertebroplasty for a midthoracic compression fracture with progressive, severe kyphosis. His condition worsened and spinal reconstruction with a 2-level VCR restored more normal sagittal alignment and decreased his gastric compression. His back pain decreased and his ability to tolerate oral intake returned. CONCLUSION: We propose the term ""sternum-into-abdomen deformity"" to describe this type of severe kyphosis with abdominal compression. Treatment with a VCR and fusion for realignment of focal kyphosis can improve the quality of life for patients with this condition. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.""",eng,0.0

We report here the 12-month and 24-month clinical outcomes of this trial. Eligible participants (n = 78) were randomly assigned to receive either vertebroplasty (n = 38) or a sham procedure (n = 40). Randomization was stratified by treatment center, sex, and symptom duration (<6 weeks or >/=6 weeks). Participants, investigators (except the treating radiologists), and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments. Enrolment occurred between April 2004 and October 2008 with follow-up completed October 2010. The primary outcome was overall pain measured on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximal imaginable pain). Secondary outcomes included pain at rest and at night, disability, quality of life, perceived recovery, and adverse events, including incident clinically apparent vertebral fractures. At 12 and 24 months, complete data were available for 67 (86%) and 57 (73%) participants, respectively. At 12 months participants in the active group improved by 2.4 +/- 2.7 (mean +/- SD) units in overall pain compared with 1.9 +/- 2.8 units in the sham group, adjusted between-group mean difference (MD) 0.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.9 to 1.5), whereas at 24 months participants in the active group had improved by 3.0 +/- 3.1 units compared with 1.9 +/- 3.0 units in the sham group, MD 1.1 (95% CI, -0.3 to 2.4). No significant between-group differences were observed for any of the secondary efficacy outcomes at 12 or 24 months. There were no between-group differences in incident clinical vertebral fractures up to 24 months (active: n = 14, sham: n = 13), although the study had inadequate power for this outcome.

The literature research revealed that the risk of a pulmonary embolism ranges from 3.5 to 23% for osteoporotic fractures. In cases of asymptomatic patients with peripheral PCE we recommend no treatment besides clinical follow-up; in cases of symptomatic or central embolisms, however, we recommend to proceed according to the guidelines regarding the treatment of thrombotic pulmonary embolisms, which includes initial heparinization and a following 6-month coumarin therapy. In order to avoid any types of embolisms, both procedures should only be performed by experienced surgeons after critical determination of the indications.",eng,0.0

Additionally the impact of the cement volume used was investigated. METHODS: Wedge compression fractures were created in 36 human cadavaric vertebrae (T10-L3). Twenty-seven vertebrae were treated with the SpineJack(R) with different cement volumes (maximum, intermediate, and no cement), and 9 vertebrae were treated with Balloon Kyphoplasty. Vertebral heights were measured pre- and postfracture as well as after treatment and loading. Cyclic loading was performed with 10,000cycles (1Hz, 100-600N). FINDINGS: The average anterior height after restoration was 85.56% for Kyphoplasty; 96.20% for SpineJack(R) no cement; 93.44% for SpineJack(R) maximum and 96% for the SpineJack(R) intermediate group. The average central height after restoration was 93.89% for Kyphoplasty; 100.20% for SpineJack(R) no cement; 99.56% for SpineJack(R) maximum and 101.13% for the SpineJack(R) intermediate group. The average anterior height after cyclic loading was 85.33 % for Kyphoplasty; 87.30% in the SpineJack(R) no cement, 92% in the SpineJack(R) maximum and 87% in the SpineJack(R) intermediate group. The average central height after cyclic loading was 92% for Kyphoplasty; 93.80% in the SpineJack(R) no cement; 98.56% in the SpineJack(R) maximum and 94.25% in the SpineJack(R) intermediate group.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a rare case of vertebral involvement of systemic mastocytosis and its multimodal therapy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebral fractures in young men are rare events. A thorough diagnostic work-up that unravels the underlying cause of osteoporosis and appropriate therapy are crucial to prevent further fractures. METHODS: A 36-year-old man was evaluated for severe back pain and was found to suffer from progressive osteoporosis and multiple vertebral fractures. Bone biopsy analysis revealed tryptase-positive mast cells that were positive for c-KIT, thus confirming the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis. RESULTS: In addition to zoledronic acid (4 mg per month) and prednisolone (50 mg per day) treatment, the patient underwent kyphoplasty. The procedure was associated with arterial hypotension which was most likely because of pressure-induced mast cell degranulation. Follow-up visits demonstrated stable bone mineral density and tolerable back pain while on zoledronic acid. CONCLUSION: Systemic mastocytosis is a rare cause of vertebral fractures in young men. Because of the potential risk of pressure-induced release of the allergy mediator histamine, kyphoplasty for vertebral involvement of systemic mastocytosis should be conducted with appropriate precautions.",eng,0.0

Balloon kyphoplasty was developed to restore vertebral height and improve sagittal alignment. Several studies have shown these theoretical improvements cannot be transferred universally to the clinical setting.
PURPOSE: The aim of the current study is to evaluate two different procedures used for percutaneous augmentation of vertebral compression fractures with respect to height restoration: balloon kyphoplasty and SpineJack.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four vertebral bodies of two intact, fresh human cadaveric spines (T6-L5; donor age, 70 years and 60 years; T-score -6.8 points and -6.3 points) were scanned using computed tomography (CT) and dissected into single vertebral bodies. Vertebral wedge compression fractures were created by a material testing machine (Universal testing machine, Instron 5566, Darmstadt, Germany). The axial load was increased continuously until the height of the anterior edge of the vertebral body was reduced by 40% of the initial measured values. After 15 minutes, the load was decreased manually to 100 N. After postfracture CT, the clamped vertebral bodies were placed in a custom-made loading frame with a preload of 100 N. Twelve vertebral bodies were treated using SpineJack (SJ; Vexim, Balma, France), the 12 remaining vertebral bodies were treated with balloon kyphoplasty (BKP; Kyphon, Medtronic, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The load was maintained during the procedure until the cement set completely. Posttreatment CT was performed. Anterior, central, and posterior height as well as the Beck index were measured prefracture and postfracture as well as after treatment.
RESULTS: For anterior height restoration (BKP, 0.14+/-1.48 mm; SJ, 3.34+/-1.19 mm), central height restoration (BKP, 0.91+/-1.04 mm; SJ, 3.24+/-1.22 mm), and posterior restoration (BKP, 0.37+/-0.57 mm; SJ, 1.26+/-1.05), as well as the Beck index (BKP, 0.00+/-0.06 mm; SJ, 0.10+/-0.06), the values for the SpineJack group were significantly higher (p<.05) CONCLUSION: The protocols for creating wedge fractures and using the instrumentation under a constant preload of 100 N led to reproducible results and effects. The study showed that height restoration was significantly better in the SpineJack group compared with the balloon kyphoplasty group. The clinical implications include a better restoration of the sagittal balance of the spine and a reduction of the kyphotic deformity, which may relate to clinical outcome and the biological healing process.

A certain proportion of patients, however, suffer a new fracture after treatment. Our purpose was to analyze the frequency of new fractures, and to estimate the causative role of PVP in the treated population. METHODS: The retrospective study reviewed all consecutive patients treated with PVP for osteoporotic compression fractures during a 5.5 years period. The study group comprised those patients, who suffered a new fracture during the follow up. The primary endpoint was the frequency of new fractures. The secondary endpoint was the occurrence of new fractures in a timeframe of 90 days after treatment that were adjacent to the previously treated segments. The causative role of PVP was estimated to be the highest in this subgroup. RESULTS: Altogether 396 consecutive patients were treated with PVP for osteoporotic compression fractures. Mean age was 68+11 years, and 23% of the population was male. The study group comprised 73 patients (18.4%). In this subgroup the patients had an average of 3.8 vertebral fractures. After PVP, adjacent fractures were significantly more likely, than distal fractures. Altogether 44 patients (11% of the entire population) suffered an adjacent fracture in 90 days after PVP. In this group there were significantly less male patients as compared to the entire population. CONCLUSIONS: After PVP almost every fifth patient is at risk for developing a new fracture, however, it is likely to be related to the vertebral augmentation in every tenth subject only. Female patients with severe osteoporosis are probably facing the highest risk for developing new fractures.",hun,0.0

It is generally considered to be safe and effective. However, infectious complications can be serious. We present a patient in whom pyogenic spondylitis developed 3 months after vertebroplasty. During the debridement, profuse bleeding was encountered from injury to the aorta and the patient was managed with primary closure. Two months after the initial surgery, an aortic aneurysm was detected. A wide resection of all infected tissue, including the bony lesion and aortic aneurysm was performed, and the descending thoracic aorta was replaced with a vascular graft. A titanium mesh cage filled with bone graft was employed for anterior reconstruction. Our patient illustrates that a life-threatening aortic aneurysm can indeed occur as an infectious complication of this minimally invasive procedure due to the proximity of the aorta to the thoracolumbar vertebra.

Kyphoplasty can be used to reduce injection pressure by making a void with a balloon tamp. The author presents a technique of making small voids to reduce cement delivery pressure during vertebroplasty that involves a simple modification of the conventional technique. METHODS: The author performed this modified vertebroplasty in 48 patients with an acute vertebral compression fracture. Small voids and micro-connections with the fracture gaps in the vertebral body were created using a curved probe placed into the vertebral body through a working cannula. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were measured preoperatively and at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively. Forty patients with osteoporotic VCFs were followed for a mean period of 6months. RESULTS: All 48 patients showed a significant reduction in visual analogue pain scores at 1 week and 3 months postoperatively versus preoperative levels (p<0.001, respectively). No device-related complications or major cement leakages that caused postoperative neurological deficits or pulmonary complications were noted. CONCLUSION: The described modification of vertebroplasty involving the creation of small cavities using a curved probe appears to control cement injection easily during the procedures and minimize cement leakage-related complications.",eng,0.0

Misaggi,2012.0,Cement leakage: safety of minimally invasive surgical techniques in the treatment of multiple myeloma vertebral lesions,10.1007/s00586-012-2221-3,"PURPOSE: To evaluate and address the safety of vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) in terms of rate and type of cement leakage in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma (MM) vertebral fractures. METHODS: A total number of 37 treated vertebrae were evaluated post-operatively by using standard X-rays and CT scan looking for a cement leakage. VP was done using a monoportal approach in all cases (18 treated levels, group A), while KP was done using a monopedicular approach in 9 levels (group B1) and using a bipedicular approach in the remaining 10 levels (group B2). A computed tomography was used to establish the presence of any cement leakage and to determine its localization. RESULTS: Vertebral augmentation through VP and KP provides immediate pain relief and an improvement of the quality of life of patients affected by MM but it is gravated by high risk of cement leakage. Cement extravasation occurred in 27.7% of total VP procedures and in 21.05% of total KP procedures, but considering the whole number of treated levels, it was more common in multi-level VP and in bipedicular KP, in which a higher quantity of cement was employed. CONCLUSIONS: KP procedure in these patients is slightly less risky but we suggest doing it with a monopedicular approach. It's mandatory to use an high viscosity cement and we suggest not to use an amount of PMMA over 2 cc and a previous treatment with bone marrow transplant is related to a lower risk of cement leakage.",eng,1.0

Singh,2011.0,Efficacy of unipedicular baloon kyphoplasty for treatment of multiple myeloma vertebral lesions,10.4184/asj.2011.5.3.162,"STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. PURPOSE: To analyze differences in between the unipedicular vs. bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of multiple myeloma lesions. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are reported to be effective for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in multiple myeloma patients. Kyphoplasty is often performed with a bipedicular approach while vertebroplasty with a monopedicular approach. Monopedicular kyphoplasty is investigated as a viable surgical technique alternatively in comparison with the bipedicular method. METHODS: We performed 37 vertebral body augmentation procedures, 18 vertebroplasty (group A) and 19 kyphoplasty, 9 unipedicular approaches (group B1) and 10 bipedicular approaches (group B2), on 14 patients affected by multiple myeloma with a mean clinical and radiographic follow up of more than 12 months. RESULTS: Both kyphoplasty techniques lead to a better postoperative improvement of the vertebral height and kyphotic deformity if compared with the vertebroplasty, with a statistical significance for the body height restoration only (p = 0.0066). The unipedicular and the bipedicular kyphoplasty have similar results in term of kyphotic deformity correction and height restoration. The 85.7% (12/14) of the patients had an immediate improvement of the pain and no difference between the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty groups were observed regarding the pain. We observed a 24.3% of cement leakage in all groups with no clinical symptoms and noticed that the risk of extravasations was higher in multilevel treatment, in bipedicular kyphoplasty procedures and in patients not treated previously with a bone marrow transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are effective in treating vertebral compression fracture due to multiple myeloma. Unipedicular kyphoplasty could give equivalent results as with bipedicular kyphoplasty in multilevel disease, aiming only to restore the sagittal alignment of the spine and the height of the vertebral body especially at the thoracolumbar spinal segment.",eng,0.0

Jourdel,2013.0,Minimally invasive treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures using the balloon kyphoplasty technique: preliminary study,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.otsr.2013.06.008,"BACKGROUND: The balloon kyphoplasty approach to the treatment of vertebral fractures can be adapted to achieve the reduction and cement stabilisation of intra-articular compression fractures at other sites, such as the calcaneus.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied six patients with a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 6-30 months). Fluoroscopy guidance was used to obtain optimal balloon positioning under the joint depression site. Reduction was achieved by expanding the balloon and stabilisation by injecting the cavity with resorbable tricalcium-phosphate cement in the younger patients and polymethyl-metacrylate cement in the two elderly patients with osteoporosis. No internal fixation was used.
RESULTS: No intra-operative, postoperative, or delayed complications were recorded. Median hospital stay length was 4.5 days (range, 3-7 days). All the fractures healed within the usual timeframe, without loss of reduction. Median time to full weight-bearing ambulation was 52.5 days (range, 15-75 days). The functional outcomes correlated with the good anatomic results, with a median American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score of 87.0 (range, 86-97).
DISCUSSION: This preliminary study shows that balloon reduction and cement fixation of intra-articular calcaneal fractures is easy to perform, reproducible, and devoid of specific complications. Good-quality reduction and stabilisation until fracture healing were achieved, and time to recovery of self-sufficiency was short, even in elderly patients with osteoporosis. These results support the use of this minimally invasive technique.

Boakye,2009.0,National trends in vertebral augmentation procedures for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures,10.1016/j.surneu.2008.02.043,"BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures represent a serious health care problem. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been gaining popularity in the treatment of symptomatic compression fractures that are often secondary to osteoporosis or neoplasia. METHODS: We use the NIS database from 1993 through 2004 to examine trends in VCFs. Patients with VCFs were identified using primary diagnostic codes (ICD-9-pathologic vertebral fracture, 733.13) and cross-referenced with ICD-9 procedure codes (ICD-9-VAPs, 78.49; kyphoplasty, 81.66; and vertebroplasty, 81.65). RESULTS: In 2004, more than 23 000 VAPs were performed nationwide on an inpatient basis for VCFs. This represented a 12 900% increase in the number of procedures performed since 1993. Approximately 60% of patients were female and aged 65 to 84 years. Nearly 60% of vertebroplasties and 25% of kyphoplasties were on patients admitted from the ED. Large-sized hospitals and those hospitals located in the southern United States accounted for most of the cases. The mean LOS was 3.7 days for kyphoplasty and 7.3 days for vertebroplasty. The final discharge disposition, home vs institution (nursing home, rehabilitation), was 50:50 for vertebroplasty and 77:23 for kyphoplasty. The mean hospital charges for both procedures were comparable, and the total national bill"" was approximately $672 million in 2004. CONCLUSIONS: With the continued aging of the population, VCFs represent an increasingly important health care issue. The staggering increase in the number of minimally invasive VAPs performed illustrates the continued adoption of these innovative technologies and early trends in their applications.""",eng,0.0

Hipp,2010.0,A pictorial classification atlas of cement extravasation with vertebral augmentation,10.1016/j.spinee.2010.09.020,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) have been in use since the mid-1980s. A mixture of liquid monomer and powder is introduced through a needle into one or both pedicles, and it polymerizes within the vertebral body in an exothermic chemical reaction. The interaction between cement and the fractured vertebral body determines whether and how the cement stabilizes the fragments, alters morphology, and extravasates. The cement is intended to remain within the vertebral body. However, some studies have reported cement leakage in more than 80% of the procedures. Although cement leakage can have no or minimal clinical consequences, adverse events, such as paraplegia, spinal cord and nerve root compression, cement pulmonary embolisms, or death, can occur. The details of how the cement infiltrates a vertebral body or extravasates out of the body are poorly understood and may help to identify strategies to reduce complications and improve clinical efficacy. PURPOSE: Apply novel techniques to demonstrate the cement spread inside vertebrae as well as the points and pattern of cement extravastation. STUDY DESIGN: Ex vivo assessment of vertebral augmentation procedures. METHODS: Vertebrae from six fresh whole human cadaver spines were used to create 24 specimens of three vertebrae each. The specimens were placed in a pneumatic testing system, designed to create controlled anterior wedge compression fractures. Unipedicular augmentation was performed on the central vertebra of 24 specimens using polymethylmethacrylate/barium sulfate Vertebroplastic cements (DePuy Spine, Raynham, MA, USA). The volume of cement injected into each vertebra was recorded. Fine-cut computed tomography (CT) scans of all segments were obtained (Brilliance 64; Philips Medical Imaging, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Using multiplanar reconstructions and volume compositing three-dimensional imaging (Osirix, www.osirix-viewer.com), each specimen was carefully assessed for cement extravasation. Specimens were then immersed in a 50% sodium hypochlorite solution until all overlying soft tissues were removed, leaving the bone and cement intact. The specimens were dried and visually examined and photographed to assess cement extravasation and fracture patterns. Specimens were cut in the axial or sagittal plains to assess the gross morphology of cement infiltration and extravasation. Finally, 25-mm block sections were removed from selected specimens and imaged at 14-mum resolution using a GE Locus-SP micro-CT system (GE Healthcare, London, Ontario, Canada). RESULTS: Infiltration was characterized by an intimate capture of trabecular bone within the cement, forming an irregular border at the perimeter of the cement that is determined by the morphology of the trabeculae and marrow spaces. Extravasation of the cement was assessed as any"" if any small or large amount of extravastation was detected and was also assessed as severe if a large amount of extravasation was found. Out of the 23 levels studied, some extravasation was visibly apparent in all levels. A wide spectrum of filling patterns, leakage points, and interdigitation of the cement was observed and appeared to be determined by the interaction of the cement with the trabecular morphology. The results support the fact that the cement generally advances through the vertebrae with relatively regular and easily identifiable borders. CONCLUSIONS: Using a cadaver VCF model, this study demonstrated the exact filling and extravastation patterns of bone cement inside and out of fractured vertebrae. These data enhance our understanding of the vertebral augmentation and extravastation mechanics.""",eng,1.0

Hipp,2013.0,A cadaver study to compare vertebral augmentation with a high-viscosity cement to augmentation with conventional lower-viscosity cement,10.1097/BSD.0b013e3182337d69,"STUDY DESIGN: Comparison of extravasations in fractured cadaver vertebrae augmented with commercial low-viscosity versus high-viscosity cements. OBJECTIVE: Use of high-resolution, 3-dimensional (3D) imaging to test the hypothesis that high-viscosity cements can reduce the type and severity of extravasations after vertebral augmentation procedures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cement extravasations are one of the primary complications of vertebral augmentation procedures. There is some evidence that high-viscosity cements might reduce extravasations, but additional data are needed to confirm the early findings. METHODS: A range of vertebral fractures were created in fresh human cadavers. One group was then augmented with a low-viscosity polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-based cement and the other group injected with high-viscosity PMMA-based cement. High-resolution computerized tomography exams were obtained, and extravasations were assessed using 3D volume renderings. The type and severity of extravasations were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: The proportion of vertebrae with any type of extravasation through the posterior wall to the spinal canal, into small vessels laterally or anteriorly, through the endplates, or anywhere around the body was not significantly different between the high-viscosity and low-viscosity groups. There was significantly less severe extravasation through the endplates (P=0.02), and a trend toward less severe extravasation through vessels (P=0.06) with the high versus low-viscosity cements. CONCLUSIONS: In agreement with previous research, high-viscosity PMMA-based cement may help to reduce the more severe forms of extravasations after vertebral augmentation procedures in newly fractured vertebrae.",eng,1.0

It may result in persistent severe pain and limited mobility, and significantly impacts the quality of life. Vertebroplasty involves a percutaneous injection of bone cement into the collapsed vertebrae by fluorescent guide. The most commonly used bone cement in percutaneous vertebroplasty is based on the polymerization of methylmethacrylate monomers to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) polymers. However, information on the properties of bone cement is mostly published in the biomaterial sciences literature, a source with which the clinical community is generally unfamiliar. This review focuses on the chemistry of bone cement polymerization and the physical properties of PMMA. The effects of altering the portions and contents of monomer liquid and polymer powders on the setting time, polymerization temperature, and compressive strength of the cement are also discussed. This information will allow spine surgeons to manipulate bone cement characteristics for specific clinical applications and improve safety.",eng,0.0

Nien,2011.0,Cement leakage causes potential thermal injury in vertebroplasty,10.1186/1471-2474-12-116,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty by injecting PMMA bone cement into the fractured vertebrae has been widely accepted in treatment of spinal compression fracture. However, the exothermic polymerization of bone cement may cause osseous or neural tissue injury. This study is thus designed to evaluate the potential risk of thermal damage in percutaneous vertebroplasty. METHOD: Twelve porcine vertebrae were immersed in 37 degrees C saline for the experiment. In the first stage of the study, vertebroplasty without cement leakage (control group, n = 6) was simulated. The anterior cortex, foramen, posterior cortex and the center of the vertebral body were selected for temperature measurement. Parameters including peak temperature and duration above 45 degrees C were recorded. In the second stage, a model (n = 6) simulating bone cement leaking into the spinal canal was designed. The methods for temperature measurement were identical to those used in the first stage. RESULTS: In Stage 1 of the study (vertebroplasty of the porcine vertebral body in the absence of cement leakage), the average maximal temperature at the anterior cortex was 42.4 +/- 2.2 degrees C; at the neural foramen 39.5 +/- 2.1 degrees C; at the posterior cortex 40.0 +/- 2.5 degrees C and at the vertebral center, 68.1 +/- 3.4 degrees C. The average time interval above 45 degrees C was 0 seconds at the anterior cortex; at the neural foramen, 0 seconds; at the posterior cortex, 0 seconds and at the vertebral center, 223 seconds. Thus, except at the core of the bone cement, temperatures around the vertebral body did not exceed 45 degrees C. In Stage 2 of the study (cement leakage model), the average maximal temperature at the anterior cortex was 42.7 +/- 2.4 degrees C; at the neural foramen, 41.1 +/- 0.4 degrees C; at the posterior cortex, 59.1 +/- 7.6 degrees C and at the vertebral center, 77.3 +/- 5.7 degrees C. The average time interval above 45 degrees C at the anterior cortex was 0 seconds; at the neural foramen, 0 seconds; at the posterior cortex, 329.3 seconds and at the vertebral center, 393.2 seconds. Based on these results, temperatures exceeded 45 degrees C at the posterior cortex and at the vertebral center. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that, for bone cement confined within the vertebra, curing temperatures do not directly cause thermal injury to the nearby soft tissue. If bone cement leaks into the spinal canal, the exothermic reaction at the posterior cortex might result in thermal injury to the neural tissue.",eng,1.0

Both interventions usually involve injection of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The purpose of this technical note was to review the theory and surgical technique for a novel percutaneous system for fracture reduction and stabilization of VCFs by using bone graft.
METHODS: This technical note highlights the Optimesh system as an alternative method of minimally invasive VCF reduction and stabilization with the delivery of a bone graft containment device. Instead of using PMMA as in vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, this system allows the delivery of allograft and/or autograft bone, with its osteoinductive, osteoconductive, and osteogenic properties.
CONCLUSIONS: This system allows for restoration of sagittal alignment of the spine with direct control of bone graft delivery by using a mesh graft containment device that allows for ingrowth of new bone and vascular tissue. [References: 46]",English,0.0

The optimal management for pulmonary cement embolism must be tailored to fit each individual patient, dependent upon the acuity of the clinical presentation, coexisting patient comorbidities, and the risks of systemic anticoagulation.

Denosumab was approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and the prevention of bone loss in some oncological situations. Denosumab discontinuation is associated with a severe bone turnover rebound (BTR) and a rapid loss of bone mineral density. The clinical consequences of the BTR observed after denosumab discontinuation are not known. Cases Description: We report 9 women who presented 50 rebound-associated vertebral fractures (RAVFs) after denosumab discontinuation. A broad biological and radiological assessment excluded other causes than osteoporosis. These 9 cases are unusual and disturbing for several reasons. First, all vertebral fractures (VFs) were spontaneous, and most patients had a high number of VFs (mean = 5.5) in a short period of time. Second, the fracture risk was low for most of these women. Third, their VFs occurred rapidly after last denosumab injection (9-16 months). Fourth, vertebroplasty was associated with a high number of new VFs. All the observed VFs seem to be related to denosumab discontinuation and unlikely to the underlying osteoporosis or osteopenia. We hypothesize that the severe BTR is involved in microdamage accumulation in trabecular bone and thus promotes VFs. Conclusion: Studies are urgently needed to determine 1) the pathophysiological processes involved, 2) the clinical profile of patients at risk for RAVFs, and 3) the management and/or treatment regimens after denosumab discontinuation. Health authorities, physicians, and patients must be aware of this RAVF risk. Denosumab injections must be scrupulously done every 6 months but not indefinitely.",eng,0.0

Conservative treatment combining antalgic agents and rest is usually recommended for symptomatic VFs. The aim of this paper is to review the randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) and percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (KP) versus conservative treatment. VP and KP procedures are associated with an acceptable general safety. Although the case series investigating VP/KP have all shown an outstanding analgesic benefit, randomized controlled studies are rare and have yielded contradictory results. In several of these studies, a short-term analgesic benefit was observed, except in the prospective randomized sham-controlled studies. A long-term analgesic and functional benefit has rarely been noted. Several recent studies have shown that both VP and KP are associated with an increased risk of new VFs. These fractures are mostly VFs adjacent to the procedure, and they occur within a shorter time period than VFs in other locations. The main risk factors include the number of preexisting VFs, the number of VPs/KPs performed, age, decreased bone mineral density, and intradiscal cement leakage. It is therefore important to involve the patients to whom VP/KP is being proposed in the decision-making process. It is also essential to rapidly initiate a specific osteoporosis therapy when a VF occurs (ideally a bone anabolic treatment) so as to reduce the risk of fracture. Randomized controlled studies are necessary in order to better define the profile of patients who likely benefit the most from VP/KP.",eng,0.0

Kyphoplasty also aims to restore vertebral body height before cement injection and so may be advantageous for more severe fractures. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty to restore vertebral height, shape, and mechanical function after severe vertebral wedge fractures. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a biomechanical and radiographic study using human cadaveric spines. METHODS: Seventeen pairs of thoracolumbar motion segments"" from cadavers aged 70-98 years were injured, in a two-stage process involving flexion and compression, to create severe anterior wedge fractures. One of each pair underwent vertebroplasty and the other kyphoplasty. Specimens were then compressed at 1 kN for 1 hour to allow consolidation. Radiographs were taken before and after injury, after treatment, and after consolidation. At these same time points, motion segment compressive stiffness was assessed, and intervertebral disc ""stress profiles"" were obtained to characterize the distribution of compressive stress on the vertebral body and neural arch. RESULTS: On average, injury reduced anterior vertebral body height by 34%, increased its anterior wedge angle from 5.0 degrees to 11.4 degrees , reduced intradiscal (nucleus) pressure and motion segment stiffness by 96% and 44%, respectively, and increased neural arch load bearing by 57%. Kyphoplasty caused 97% of the anterior height loss to be regained immediately, although this reduced to 79% after consolidation. Equivalent gains after vertebroplasty were significantly lower: 59% and 47%, respectively (p<.001). Kyphoplasty reduced vertebral wedging more than vertebroplasty (p<.02). Intradiscal pressure, neural arch load bearing, and motion segment compressive stiffness were restored significantly toward prefracture values after both augmentation procedures, even after consolidation, but these mechanical effects were similar for kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: After severe vertebral wedge fractures, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty were equally effective in restoring mechanical function. However, kyphoplasty was better able to restore vertebral height and reverse wedge deformity.""",eng,1.0

We have observed unsuspected clefts opacifying frequently during vertebroplasty. Our purpose in this study was to determine the incidence of these clefts in symptomatic osteoporotic compression fractures, assess the sensitivity of MR imaging and conventional radiography in the detection of these clefts, and determine whether there is any prognostic significance of these clefts in patients treated with vertebroplasty. METHODS: Retrospective chart reviews were conducted of 135 vertebroplasty procedures performed during a 2-year period. MR images and conventional radiographs were reviewed for the presence of clefts defined as fluid-filled cavities on MR images or gas-filled cavities on conventional radiographs. Digital radiographs obtained at the time of the procedure were inspected for the presence of opacified clefts. Imaging findings were correlated with subjective pain scores documented before the procedure and at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after vertebroplasty. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-six osteoporotic compression fractures were treated with polymethylmethacrylate in 125 patients. Thirty-one and eight-tenths percent of the fractures were noted to contain clefts at the time of vertebroplasty. Fluid-filled clefts were detected on preoperative MR images in only 52.8% of the fractures with opacified clefts at vertebroplasty. Gas-filled clefts were evident on preoperative conventional radiographs in only 11.4% of the fractures with opacified clefts at vertebroplasty. No significant difference was noted in numerical pain scores between the two populations at baseline or 1 week or 1 month after the procedure. Pain scores at 6 and 12 months after vertebroplasty showed a trend toward greater pain relief in patients with clefts, although the difference was not statistically significant. A sustained, statistically significant decrease in pain scores after treatment (P <.01) was noted in both groups. CONCLUSION: Intravertebral clefts are much more common than previously described and probably represent fracture nonunions. Imaging is not sensitive in detecting these clefts before vertebroplasty. We advocate complete filling of the cleft with cement during vertebroplasty to maximize stabilization of the fracture fragments. There is a trend toward greater pain relief being achieved 6 and 12 months after the procedure in patients with clefts that are opacified at the time of vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

Cement augmentation, used alone for prophylactic stabilisation or in conjunction with a posterior decompression and fixation, provides a useful addition in the management of these patients optimising their chance to remain ambulant, continent, and pain-free.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: Examine the overall survival and treatment costs from a third-party-payer perspective for patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) treated by vertebral augmentation or conservative treatment in Germany. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: OVCFs are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and thus reduced quality of life. Vertebral augmentation has been shown to be effective in these fractures. The association between treatment and survivorship as well as cost per life year gained for balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) and percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was analyzed in the Medicare population. Replication of these analyses is warranted for confidence in findings. METHODS: Claims data from a major health insurance fund were used. Mortality risk differences between operated (BKP, PVP) and nonoperated cohorts were assessed by Cox regression. Operated patient groups were established by propensity score matching adjusting for covariates. For the matched operated patients with OVCF, (2006-2010) survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A total of 598 newly diagnosed patients with OVCF were operated of 3607 patients with OVCF. The operated cohort was 43% less likely to die than the nonoperated one in the 5-year study period (hazard ratio = 0.57; P < 0.001). Patients who received BKP had higher 60-month adjusted survival rate (66.7%) than those who received PVP (58.7%) (P = 0.68). Cumulative 4-year mean overall costs after first diagnosis were lower for the BKP cohort (PVP: euro42,510 vs. BKP: euro39,014). Initial upfront higher costs driven by surgical treatment for patients who received BKP are offset by considerable pharmacy costs in patients who received PVP. There were differences between the values of painkiller consumption (PVP: euro3321 vs. BKP: euro2224). CONCLUSION: Results suggest a higher overall survival rate for operated than nonoperated patients with OVCF and indicate a potential survival benefit for patients who received BKP compared with patients who received PVP. The reasons merit further investigation. Total costs were lower after 4 years for patients who received BKP versus PVP due to less consumption of pharmaceuticals. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.",eng,1.0

Hamze,2004.0,Complications of percutaneous vertebroplasty and their prevention,10.1007/s00256-004-0776-8,"Complications due to vertebroplasty may be divided into two categories whether or not they are related to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement leakage from the compressed vertebral body. PMMA leakage is a very frequent occurrence in vertebroplasty is also the main source of complications. Neurological complications are due to cement leakage into the spinal canal and less exceptionally into the intervertebral foramen. The transpedicular needle approach reduces the risk of cement leakage into the foramen. Pulmonary embolism of PMMA may occur when there is a failure to recognize venous migration of cement early during the procedure. Cortical destruction, presence of an epidural soft-tissue mass, highly vascularized lesions, and severe vertebral collapse are factors which increase the rate of complications, which is therefore much higher in metastatic than in osteoporotic vertebral collapse. Prevention of PMMA leakage-related complications is a multifactorial issue including procedure preparation, needle approach and placement, and cement application. The technical refinements which may help reduce the risk of PMMA leakage are reviewed in this article. Experimental data have shown that systemic reactions may occur during vertebroplasty in the absence of cement leakage. These reactions may be partly related to vascular embolism of bone marrow fat. Another controversial issue is a possible increase in the risk of vertebral collapse of adjacent vertebrae following vertebroplasty. Prospective randomized studies are needed to resolve this issue.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,J. D. Laredo; B. Hamze,2005.0,Complications of percutaneous vertebroplasty and their prevention,", ","Vertebroplasty is an efficient treatment of vertebral collapses of malignant or benign origin but also carries a risk of complications. Cement extravasation is a frequent occurrence in vertebroplasty. It is well tolerated in the large majority of cases but is also the main source of complications especially nerve root compression in case of cement leakage into the intervertebral foramen and pulmonary embolism of cement complicating venous cement leakage. Rate of these complications are much higher in malignant than in osteoporotic collapses. The risk of neurological complication also increases at the cervical level. In addition, incidence of new vertebral fractures in adjacent vertebrae may be increased by vertebroplasty. General reactions possibly due to a reflex reaction to intramedullary bone injection and fat embolism may also occur. This article reviews the safety measures to reduce the risk of cement extravasation including high quality permanent radiological guidance enabling early detection of cement extravasation, use of conscious sedation, bilateral transpedicular approach at the thoracic and lumbar levels, careful selection of the bone penetration site in order to make a single vertebral needle path, careful needle placement to avoid the risk of cortical breakthrough, use of a well-opacified and refrigerated cement with a toothpaste consistency.",eng,0.0

Along with the three classic locations hip, spine and wrist, there are several other fractures that commonly are related to osteoporosis. The weak bone makes it difficult to achieve a stable bone-implant construct and general weakness of the patient often prevents reduction of load on the injured extremity during healing. The main treatment goal should be preservation of function even at the expense of restoration of exact anatomy. By development of dynamic load-sharing implants and less invasive techniques the results following fixation of osteoporotic fractures has improved. A new strategy has also been to develop materials that will enhance the strength of the cancellous bone that surrounds the metal implant. By using bioactive cement in conjunction with metal implants improved strength has been shown in internally fixed metaphyseal fractures. Encouraging results have also been reported after cement injection into compressed vertebral fractures, so called vertebroplasty. The specific demands involved in the treatment of osteoporotic fractures calls for specific solutions. Apart from augmentation of the cancellous bone and development of new load-sharing devices, endoprosthetic replacement with specially designed fracture prosthesis has become more frequent.

During the past decade bisphosphonates have become an important adjunctive treatment in the management of MM, in which they have shown the ability to reduce bony complications associated with the disease. Advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, offer these patients less-invasive options for the treatment of vertebral collapse and restoration of their normal function.

OBJECTIVES: To describe a surgical procedure designed to prevent fracture and cutting-through and pullout of screws in the adjacent segment after multilevel deformity correction in adults. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgery of adult deformities has a high complication rate. One of the potential late complications is the development of fracture at the first mobile segment above a multilevel lumbar or thoracolumbar spinal fusion that necessitates further surgical intervention with extension of the instrumentation. Augmentation with bone cement of the last instrumented vertebra and the first mobile vertebra has the potential to prevent this pathology. METHODS: Three patients with degenerative thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis and 3 with adjacent segment failure after correction surgery were treated. Cannulated and perforated pedicle screws were placed in the uppermost-instrumented vertebra. A vertebroplasty tube was inserted from 1 side at the center of the first mobile vertebra. Under C-arm control, vertebroplasty was performed in both vertebrae. RESULTS: Intraoperatively, there were no cement-related complications. Follow-ups at 6 and 12 (+/-2) months revealed there was no loss of correction, fracture or screw loosening in the augmented vertebrae. CONCLUSIONS: Bone cement augmentation of the uppermost screws and the first mobile vertebra in multilevel adult deformity and revision surgery seems to be a safe and potentially effective method of preventing adjacent segment failure.",eng,0.0

Fragility fractures, including vertebral compression fractures, have been associated with increased mortality. Early operative interventions for patients sustaining hip fractures have been found to reduce mortality. PURPOSE: To determine if kyphoplasty improves survival after vertebral compression fractures. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of all kyphoplasty procedures performed by the same orthopedic surgeon between June 2000 and June 2004 and a review of patients receiving nonoperative care consisting of oral analgesia and an orthosis during the same time period were conducted. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients seen by a single surgeon for an osteoporotic vertebral body fracture. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was patient death within the study time period. METHODS: Data from both groups were tabulated and analyzed for statistical differences by Student t test and chi-squared analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves comparing age, medical comorbidity, and surgical intervention were constructed. Log-rank test was used to analyze the survival curves. RESULTS: Of the 94 patients who elected for kyphoplasty, 38 patients were deceased at the close of the current study which ended in September 2006, whereas 26 of the 90 patients who elected for conservative therapy had died. Student t test revealed a significant age difference between patients treated with kyphoplasty and those who were treated nonoperatively (p=.0002). Chi-squared analysis revealed a significant difference between the two populations with respect to Charlson score (p=.050) but no statistical difference between the two populations with respect to ASA (p=.81) or gender (p=.1207). Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to independently assess the influence of age, medical comorbidity, and kyphoplasty on survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first 1000 compression fractures treated by vertebroplasty at our institution were identified from a comprehensive prospectively acquired vertebroplasty data base. All patients treated with vertebroplasty were included, regardless of the underlying pathologic cause. Chart reviews of the procedure notes, imaging studies, clinical visits, and follow-up telephone interviews were performed for each patient. Evaluation at each follow-up time point included pain response (subjective and visual analog pain score), change in mobility, change in pain medication usage, and modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed on the pain response and change in the Roland-Morris score at each follow-up time point. Significant procedure-related complications that occurred from the time of the procedure were also specifically extracted from the patients' charts. RESULTS: There was a dramatic improvement in all the evaluated parameters following percutaneous vertebroplasty. The improvement in pain, mobility, medication usage, and Roland-Morris score was noticed immediately after the procedure and persisted through the 2-year follow-up.

In this study, we have investigated the influences of vertebroplasty filler materials (polymethylmethacrylate-, calcium phosphate- and calcium sulfate-based bone cement) on isolated nucleus pulposus cells. Cell viability of cultured human nucleus pulposus cells were measured after treatment with vertebroplasty filler materials. Gene expression profile of selected genes was determined with quantitative real-time PCR. The widely used polymethylmethacrylate and calcium phosphate cement significantly decreased cell number in a dose- and time-dependent manner while calcium sulfate cement affected cell viability less. Expression of genes involved in matrix metabolism of nucleus pulposus--aggrecan, collagens, small proteoglycans--as well as important transcription factors have also significantly changed due to treatment (e.g., 2.5-fold decrease in aggrecan expression was determined in cultures due to polymethylmethacrylate treatment). Our results suggest that vertebroplasty filler materials--depending on the type of applied material--can accelerate the degeneration of nucleus pulposus cells resulting in a less flexible disc in case of intradiscal cement leakage. This process may increase the risk of a subsequent new vertebral fracture, the main complication of vertebral augmentation.

Our aim was to examine the NIS data base to identify trends in spine augmentation procedures over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were identified from the NIS data base by using primary diagnosis codes (ICD-9-pathologic vertebral fracture, 733.13) and procedures codes (ICD-9-other repair of bone, 78.49; vertebroplasty, 81.65; kyphoplasty, 81.66). Means and their corresponding standard errors were compared for statistically significant differences by using the Z-test. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2008, >240 000 inpatient spine augmentations were performed in the United States. From 2001 to 2008, there was a 741% increase in the number of hospital discharges for patients who underwent a spine augmentation, but the year-to-year rate of increase has been declining since 2001. From 2004 to 2008, >50 000 inpatient verterbroplasties and >152 000 inpatient kyphoplasties were identified. Compared with vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty patients were less often admitted from the emergency department (33% versus 56%, P < .001), had shorter postaugmentation hospital stays (2.3 versus 3.1 days, P < .001), had fewer comorbidities at presentation (1.4 versus 1.6, P < .01), and were less likely to be discharged to a long-term facility (28% versus 43%, P < .001).

RESULTS: Immediately after surgery, the patient had complete motor and sensory deficits at T11. Computed tomography scan showed spinal cord compression caused by venous leakage of polymethylmethacrylate. In anticipation of recovery from paraplegia, posterior decompression was performed from L2 to T10.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of new vertebroplasty technique. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Viscous polymethylmethacrylate cement is frequently used to avoid leakage in vertebroplasty. However, the large force required to inject the cement can require the use of special equipment or the direct injection of the cement without a cannula. In addition, injection under fluoroscopic guidance with a short or absent cannula is associated with a higher intraoperative radiation dose. A method using an angiographic catheter for thin cement injection is presented. METHODS: Real-time, fluoroscopy-controlled, catheter-assisted, thin cement injection was used for 102 vertebroplasty sessions (84 patients, 148 vertebrae). Leakage was monitored in 85 procedures via computed tomography. RESULTS: All vertebral bodies were successfully and satisfactorily filled with bone cement. Cement leakage was evident in 50% of the 85 asymptomatic cases (25 paraspinal, 29 epidural, and 30 intradisc space). On follow-up, new compression fractures were noted in the same (n = 5) or adjacent (n = 16) vertebral body, and elsewhere (n = 10). Vertebroplasty provided pain relief in >90% of cases. Recurrent compression fracture occurred in 5 vertebrae of 4 patients after vertebroplasty. New compression fractures occurred in 16 adjacent vertebral bodies of 11 patients and in 10 vertebral bodies remote from the site. One patient who developed osteomyelitis was successfully treated with antibiotics alone. CONCLUSION: Real-time, fluoroscopy-controlled, catheter-assisted, low-viscosity cement injection is a safe and feasible method for vertebroplasty, and produces a comparable outcome as high-viscosity cements.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: New vertebral compression fracture (NVCF) is a highly potential risk after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). The study aimed at analyzing the incidence and risk factors of NVCF and preventing its development. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PVP is widely used and highly effective technique for reducing pain caused by an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. However, there is a great deal of debate about whether PVP is associated with NVCF, and many risk factors of NVCF have been hypothesized. METHODS: From January to December 2008, a total of 198 patients (176 women, 22 men; mean age, 76.6+/-0.5 y) who underwent PVP at 270 levels for painful osteoporotic VCF were retrospectively analyzed during a 4-year follow-up. The following parameters were evaluated: NVCF incidence and average time, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, the existence of trauma, and bone mineral density (BMD) before and after PVP. Cement location, intradiscal leakage, distribution pattern, kyphotic angle, sagittal index, compression ratio, injected cement volume, and numbers of fractures and thoracolumbar junction fractures were analyzed. RESULTS: During follow-up, 34 patients (17.2%) sustained symptomatic NVCF for 4-year follow-up. All 34 patients with NVCF had lower BMD than that before initial PVP. For adjacent VCF, multivariable analysis showed that a higher risk of NVCF after vertebroplasty was associated with a larger number of VCF (P=0.025) and lower BMI (P=0.045), whereas for remote VCF, the risk of NVCF was higher in patients who had not experienced trauma and lower BMD (P=0.045). None of the radiographic evaluation values were related to the occurrence of NVCF. CONCLUSIONS: The most important elements related to reducing NVCF were treating osteoporosis and improving BMD and BMI. More aggressive BMD and BMI correction is more important than the vertebroplasty technique.",eng,1.0

Hong,2012.0,Comparative analysis of clinical outcomes in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs): conservative treatment versus balloon kyphoplasty,10.1016/j.spinee.2012.08.024,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Most osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) can be treated conservatively. Recently, kyphoplasty has become a common treatment for painful osteoporotic compression fractures and has shown numerous benefits, such as early pain control and height restoration of the collapsed vertebral body. In spite of being a simple procedure, numerous complications related to kyphoplasty have been reported. Moreover, there is limited evidence to support its superiority. PURPOSE: To compare the clinical outcomes of patients with OVCF according to different treatment modalities and identify clinical risk factors related to failure of conservative treatment of OVCF. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study consisting of a review of case report forms. PATIENTS SAMPLE: We prospectively enrolled 259 patients who had one or two acute painful OVCFs confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. All patients were treated conservatively in the initial 3 weeks. Kyphoplasty was performed in 91 patients who complained of sustained back pain and disability in spite of conservative treatment for the initial 3 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain score using visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). METHODS: Participants were stratified according to age, sex, level and number of fractures, bone mineral density, body mass index (BMI), collapse rates, and history of spine fractures. Pain scores using VASs were assessed at 1 week and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 259 patients were enrolled, and 231 patients (82 of 91 patients in the kyphoplasty group [KP] and 149 of 168 patients in the conservative treatment group) completed the 1-year follow-up. About 65% of patients were treated successfully with conservative treatment. Risk factors for failure of 3 weeks of conservative treatment were older age (older than 78.5 years), severe osteoporosis (t score less than -2.95), overweight (BMI more than 25.5), and larger collapse rates (more than 28.5%). There were significant reductions in VAS and ODI scores in both groups at each follow-up assessment. At the first month, better clinical results were observed in KP. However, there were no significant differences in outcome measures between the two groups at 3, 6, or 12 months. Thirteen subsequent compression fractures (five in KP and eight in the conservative treatment group) occurred during the 1-year follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Both treatments of OVCF showed successful clinical results at the end of the 1-year follow-up period. Kyphoplasty showed better outcomes in the first month only. Given these results, prompt kyphoplasty should not be indicated in the case of a patient with OVCF that has no risk factors for failure with conservative treatment. Rather, a trial of conservative, 3-week treatment would be beneficial.",eng,0.0

Im,2010.0,CT evaluation of local leakage of bone cement after percutaneous kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty,10.3109/02841851003620366,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous injection of bone cement (acrylic cement) during percutaneous kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty can cause symptomatic or asymptomatic complications due to leakage, extravasation or vascular migration of cement. PURPOSE: To investigate and to compare the incidence and site of local leakage or complications of bone cement after percutaneous kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty using bone cement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 473 cases of percutaneous kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty performed under fluoroscopic guidance. Of the 473 cases, follow-up CT scans that covered the treated bones were available for 83 cases (59 kyphoplasty and 24 vertebroplasty). RESULTS: The rate of local leakage of bone cement was 87.5% (21/24) for percutaneous vertebroplasty and 49.2% (29/59) for kyphoplasty. The most common site of local leakage was perivertebral soft tissue (n=8, 38.1%) for vertebroplasty. The most common site of local leakage was a perivertebral vein (n=7, 24.1%) for kyphoplasty. Two cases of pulmonary cement embolism developed: one case after kyphoplasty and one case after vertebroplasty. CONCLUSION: Local leakage of bone cement was more common for percutaneous vertebroplasty compared with kyphoplasty (P<0.005). The most common sites of local leakage were perivertebral soft tissue and perivertebral vein.",eng,1.0

Lee,2014.0,Comparison of radiological and clinical results of balloon kyphoplasty according to anterior height loss in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture,10.1016/j.spinee.2014.01.028,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Percutaneous kyphoplasty is effective for pain reduction and vertebral height restoration in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. However, in cases of severely collapsed fractures involving the loss of more than 70% of the vertebral height, kyphoplasty is technically difficult to perform and the outcomes remain unknown. PURPOSE: To compare the vertebral height restoration rate, kyphotic angle, and clinical results of patients who underwent kyphoplasty according to the degree of anterior vertebral height loss. In addition, to determine the feasibility and effects of kyphoplasty on severely collapsed osteoporotic vertebral fractures. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A retrospective study. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 129 patients (145 vertebrae) who underwent kyphoplasty for osteoporotic painful vertebral fracture and followed up for more than 1 year between September 2005 and August 2012 were recruited for the analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: The patients' kyphotic angle, anterior vertebral height, and anterior vertebral height restoration ratio 1 year after surgery were compared. Pre- and postoperative pain around the fractured vertebra and the radiological and clinical results according to bone mineral density (BMD) were also compared. METHODS: Patients were divided into three groups for comparison, according to radiographic findings. Patients with an anterior height compression ratio more than 70% at the time of fracture comprised Group I, patients with a compression ratio of 50-70% comprised Group II, and those with a compression ratio of 30-50% comprised Group III. RESULTS: Group I showed a greater extent of anterior height restoration immediately after surgery compared with the other groups, which noticeably decreased over time. All three groups showed significant restoration of the anterior vertebral height between pre- and postoperative values. The anterior vertebral height 1 year after surgery did not differ between Group I and Group II but was significantly higher in Group III. There was no correlation between the BMD and restoration or decrease of anterior vertebral height over time. Pain around the fractured vertebra significantly decreased in all groups immediately and 1 year after surgery compared with preoperative levels, although the pain level 1 year after surgery did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with an anterior vertebral compression ratio more than 70% because of osteoporotic vertebral fracture, although the anterior height and kyphotic angle were significantly lower than those of patients with an anterior vertebral compression ratio of 30% to 50%, kyphoplasty significantly improved the degree of pain, restored the anterior vertebral height, and maintained the kyphotic angle. Therefore, kyphoplasty can be a useful approach in patients with an anterior vertebral compression ratio more than 70%.",eng,0.0

Park,2016.0,Comparison of remifentanil with dexmedetomidine for monitored anaesthesia care in elderly patients during vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty,https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300060515607385,"OBJECTIVES: This clinical trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. (NCT02476981)This randomized, prospective double-blind study compared remifentanil with dexmedetomidine for monitored anaesthesia care during minimally invasive corrections of vertebral compression fractures (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty).
METHODS: Patients>65 years of age with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I-III, scheduled for vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty under monitored anaesthesia care, received remifentanil (i.v. infusion 1-5micro g/kg/h) or dexmedetomidine (loading dose 0.3-0.4micro g/kg followed by i.v. infusion 0.2-1micro g/kg/h) to maintain observer's assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale <4 during the procedure.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in demographic data between the remifentanil (n=37) and dexmedetomidine groups (n=38). Patients on dexmedetomidine experienced lower mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), and higher SpO2 values, than patients on remifentanil. Compared with dexmedetomidine, remifentanil produced more respiratory depression, oxygen desaturation, and reduced the need for additional intraoperative opioids. There were no significant between-group differences in terms of recovery time, investigators' satisfaction scores, or patients' overall pain experiences.
CONCLUSIONS: During monitored anaesthesia care, dexmedetomidine provides less respiratory depression, lower MAP and HR, but also less analgesic effect than remifentanil in elderly patients undergoing vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty.

Kim,2013.0,Triparesis caused by gas-containing extensive epidural abscess secondary to Aeromonas hydrophila infection of a thoracic vertebroplasty: a case report,10.1016/j.spinee.2013.03.045,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Aeromonas hydrophila is a motile gram-negative non-sporeforming rod with facultative anaerobic metabolism. Except for gastrointestinal disease, skin and soft-tissue infections represent the second most common site of human Aeromonas infections. However, to our knowledge, A. hydrophila infection of the spine has not been reported to date. PURPOSE: To report the first case of A. hydrophila spinal infection of the T7 vertebra after vertebroplasty. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: A 72-year-old man was transferred to our emergency department with chief complaints of severe midthoracic pain and triparesis. He had undergone vertebroplasty for a painful vertebral fracture at T7 5 weeks before transfer. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an infection of the T7 vertebroplasty and an extensive epidural abscess. The epidural abscess originating from the infected T7 vertebroplasty extended from the T8 to the C4 epidural space. Computed tomography demonstrated sparsely scattered gas in the epidural abscess, strongly suggestive of an anaerobic infection. RESULTS: Emergency multilevel laminectomies from C5 to T8 and a posterior instrumentation from T3 to T10 were performed. A. hydrophila was isolated from the blood cultures. The patient was treated with intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam. Posterior decompression and stabilization in combination with appropriate antibiotic treatment completely resolved the neurologic deficit and infection without the need for further anterior corpectomy of the infected T7 vertebroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of spine infection caused by A. hydrophila. The infection developed after vertebroplasty for the management of a painful vertebral fracture. Triparesis occurred rapidly due to an extensive epidural abscess containing gas. Emergency decompression and stabilization in combination with appropriate antibiotic treatment achieved a successful clinical outcome.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of vertebroplasty on pulmonary function in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures of the thoracic spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A percutaneous vertebroplasty is an excellent method for relieving pain and improving the quality of life in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures of the thoracic spine. However, the effect of vertebroplasty on pulmonary functions in such patients has not been reported. METHODS: This study included 72 patients (85 vertebrae) who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty for thoracic osteoporotic compression fractures (male/female, 10/62; mean age, 75.7+/-7.6 y). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were conducted preoperatively on the study patients, and 2 days, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. PFT parameters [% predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (% pred FEV1), % predicted forced vital capacity (% pred FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio] were measured using a spirometer. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score, the thoracic kyphotic angles, and the local kyphotic angles were obtained before and after vertebroplasty to evaluate the clinical and radiologic outcomes. The correlations among variables (PFT parameters, age, gender, the number of vertebrae involved in the vertebroplasty, the change of thoracic kyphotic angles, the change of local kyphotic angles, and the VAS scores) were analyzed. RESULTS: The preoperative and postoperative (2 d, 1 mo, and 3 mo) PFT parameters were as follows: % pred FVC, 58+/-23.8, 71.8+/-22.2, 75.4+/-21.4, and 76+/-22.1; % pred FEV1, 58.3+/-24.3, 66.1+/-23.7, 67.5+/-24.2, and 68+/-24.5; FEV1/FVC ratio (%), 101.2+/-17.8, 91.3+/-15.5, 88.8+/-15.2, and 88.6+/-14.2, respectively. The preoperative mean VAS score was 7.93+/-1.5 and significantly decreased to 3.15+/-1.59, 1.76+/-1.26, and 1.67+/-1.23 at 2 days, 1 month, and 3 months after the vertebroplasty, respectively. There were no significant differences in the thoracic and local kyphotic angles after the vertebroplasty compared with the preoperative values. The decrease in the VAS scores and age correlated with the PFT parameters; however, there were no significant correlations between the PFT parameters and other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty improved pulmonary function immediately after the procedure in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures of the thoracic spine, and this improvement correlated with pain relief.",eng,0.0

We also investigated the effect of intradiscal cement leakage on adjacent vertebral fracture formation after PVP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2003 to March 2009, 188 patients (163 women, 25 men; mean age, 70.9 years; range, 42-92 years) who underwent 214 PVP sessions at 351 levels for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were retrospectively enrolled in this study. The effect of intradiscal cement leakage on new adjacent vertebral fracture formation after PVP was evaluated. Possible other risk factors were also analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. The risk factors included age, gender, mean bone mineral density (BMD), the vertebral level treated, presence of an intravertebral cleft or cyst before treatment, kyphosis angle, wedge angle, and the injected cement volumes. RESULTS: During the follow-up periods, new adjacent vertebral fractures developed in 36 (10.3%) of 351 treated levels. For 91 (25.9%) levels, intradiscal cement leakage was detected on procedural fluoroscopic radiographs. There was no statistically significant association between intradiscal cement leakage and new adjacent vertebral compression fracture (p = 0.789). Among the other risk factors, only the vertebral levels treated, especially the thoracolumbar junction, showed a significant relationship to new adjacent vertebral fractures (univariate analysis, p = 0.037; multivariate analysis, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Intradiscal cement leakage does not seem to be related to subsequent adjacent vertebral compression fracture in patients who underwent PVP for treatment of an osteoporotic compression fracture. The thoracolumbar location of the initial compression fracture is the only factor correlated with an adjacent vertebral fracture after PVP.",eng,1.0

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recently, the development of VP and balloon KP has been shown to provide symptomatic relief and restoration of sagittal alignment of vertebral compression fractures refractory to medical therapy. Complications in treatment of vertebral compression fractures are rare, however can be potentially devastating. Fortunately, clinical sequelae are rare; however, severe clinical complications from cement extravasation have been reported. METHODS: Using PubMed and Ovid, we performed a literature search for kyphoplasty,"" ""vertebroplasty,"" and ""vertebral augmentation."" This search was performed in December 2006. Case reports and reports not available in English were excluded. We categorized complications in 3 categories: (1) procedure-related complications, (2) medical complications, and (3) new vertebral fracture. Cement leakage, asymptomatic and symptomatic, and its locations were recorded. We performed a meta-analysis of complications of all studies. We then repeated the meta-analysis examining only prospective studies. We then used proportion analysis to determine statistical significance. We defined statistical significance as a P value less than 0.05. RESULTS: We identified 121 reports of KP and/or VP that specifically addressed complications. Of these studies, 33 addressed KP and 82 addressed VP (6 reports addressed complications of both). There were 29 reports in which the data appeared to be collected prospectively. Of these, 9 addressed KP and 21 addressed VP.VP was found to have a significantly increased rate of procedure-related complications than KP in the analysis of all studies and only prospective studies. VP also appears to have a significantly higher rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic cement leakage than KP (P < 0.05). The incidence of medical complications was significantly higher in the KP procedure; however, this difference was not observed when analyzing only prospective studies. The incidence of new fracture was significantly higher in the VP procedure; however, this was not observed when analyzing only prospective studies. CONCLUSION: VP and KP are 2 minimally invasive procedures that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of symptomatic vertebral compression fractures. Although the incidence of adverse events for both VP and KP are low, it appears that VP is associated with a statistically significant increased rate of procedure-related complications and cement extravasation (symptomatic and asymptomatic). Future prospective studies with large patient enrollment will be needed to further validate the finding of this meta-analysis.""",eng,0.0

METHODS: A total of 391 patients with single-level osteoporotic thoracolumbar junctional (T10-L2) fracture were selectively enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups by absence (group I) or presence (group II) of SPF. Clinical and radiologic parameters were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Group I comprised of 332 patients with only vertebral body fracture, and group II comprised of 59 patients with both vertebral body and SPFs. In all cases of group II, SPFs were located just one level above the fractured vertebral body, and the injury of the posterior ligament was not found. At the time of injury, group II patients showed worse outcomes in anterior vertebral body compression percentage, kyphotic Cobb angle, cranial disk status, and the rate of the initial neurologic injury. Kyphotic alignment changes during 1-year follow-up were compared between the conservative subgroups of groups I and II. At the time of injury, there were no statistical differences in anterior vertebral body compression percentage and Cobb angle between the two conservative subgroups. However, the difference was significant after 1-year follow-up. Comparison of kyphotic alignment change at 12 months after diagnosis within group II was done according to the treatment method. Vertebroplasty subgroup in group II did not show benefit even in preventing such kyphotic alignment change, whereas instrumentation subgroup in group II showed lordotic alignment restoration despite more severe kyphotic alignment at the time of injury. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporotic thoracolumbar junctional fracture accompanied by spinous process fracture without posterior ligament injury represented more severe injury with flexion forces on the anterior column and tensile forces on the posterior column, and was related with more severe posttraumatic kyphotic changes during the 12-month follow-up.",eng,0.0

Devastating cord injury with Kummell's disease is rare except in advanced cases with kyphosis and posterior cortex breakage. PURPOSE: The authors report unique experience with patients who presented with a catastrophic intramedullary hematoma after early stage Kummell's disease without kyphosis. STUDY DESIGN: Case report with analysis of the literature. METHODS: A 72-year-old woman with osteoporotic vertebral fractures of T12 visited the emergency room complaining of persistent back pain and paraparesis. The plain radiographic examination revealed mild osteoporotic wedge compression fractures. The magnetic resonance images revealed the fracture cavity as a discrete area of abnormal low and high signal, which is consistent with vertebral osteonecrosis with evidence of Kummell's disease on T12, and conus showing an extensive hematoma with mixed signal changes. RESULTS: The authors performed laminectomy and the removal of the intramedullary hematoma, followed by vertebroplasty on T12. The spinal column was reduced and fixed posteriorly with a pedicle screw system using a one-stage procedure. CONCLUSIONS: An increasing awareness of the delayed vertebral collapse with cord injury attached to an osteoporotic spine fracture, as well as a periodic follow-up and treatment are essential for preventing catastrophic neurological impairment.",eng,1.0

Ten consecutive patients with cord compression were enrolled in this study. The mean number of fused segments was 3.2. Instrumentation and posterolateral bone grafts were performed for one level above and below the collapsed vertebra with the exception of one patient. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement was then injected into the intravertebral cleft and posterior decompression was performed when needed. The visual analog scale (VAS) pain score and Frankel grade were used to evaluate the clinical results and radiological parameters were also assessed. The mean VAS score before vertebroplasty was 7.5, which was reduced to 3.2 postoperatively, and was 3.7 at the most recent follow-up. The mean follow-up duration was 12.1 months. Seven (83%) of the eight patients with motor deficits showed an improvement in neurological function by at least 1 Frankel grade.

In this study, we investigated that how much difference of compression ratio between standing simple radiograph and supine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) affects the collapse progression after vertebroplasty. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was carried out based on 27 patients with 31 OVCFs undergone vertebrplastyin the thoracolumbar junction (T12-L2), from January to December 2009. The OVCFs were divided to two groups, the smaller group A and larger group B, by mean compression ratio difference (8.1%) between standing simple radiograph and supine MRI. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the two groups except age. There were also no significant differences between the periodic compression ratio, back pain, Cobb's angle during follow-up period. However, Group B seemed to show improvements from the initial state to the point just after the operation, but eventually took a much worse course than group A. In the end, judging from the compression ratios of the two groups at the last follow up, group A showed less progression. CONCLUSION: Although the clinical outcome was not different significantly, a greater compression ratio difference in the initial study resulted in a greater collapse progression at last follow-up. Therefore, we suggest that it is important to check the initial standing simple radiograph, as well as supine MRI, for predicting collapse progression after vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

PURPOSE: To compare quality of life in postmenopausal women with osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) who underwent vertebroplasty (VP) or kyphoplasty (KP). OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Patient with OVFs who do not respond to conservative treatment can be treated with VP or ballon KP for faster pain relief. There are controversies on which procedure is more effective. METHODS: Five hundred twenty-eight postmenopausal women in nationwide hospitals with age of 50 years or older who underwent VP of KP for OVFs were enrolled in this study. Health related quality of life was measured using the European Quality of Life 5 Domains (EQ-5D) and visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: In the VP group, average EQ-5D dimension was 1.95 in mobility, 1.86 in self care, 2.02 in usual activity, 2.19 in pain, 1.69 in anxiety or depression. In the KP group, average EQ-5D dimension was 1.83 in mobility, 1.78 in self care, 1.98 in usual activity, 2.03 in pain, 1.55 in anxiety or depression. Quality of life of KP group was significantly better than that of the VP group in mobility (p=0.016), pain (p=0.001), and anxiety or depression (p=0.008). Average EQ-5D index of the VP and the KP group was 0.353 (+/-0.472) and 0.485 (+/-0.357), respectively. The EQ-5D index of the KP group was significantly (p<0.001) higher than that of the KP group.

CNL has been associated with multiple myelomas in many reported cases, but transition of Polycythemia Vera (PV) to CNL is very rare. An 81-year-old female patient, who had undergone intermittent phlebotomy following the diagnosis of PV 8 years previously, was admitted to our hospital due to lower back pain. A physical examination showed a splenomegaly 2 cm below the costal margin, with tenderness of the thoracic and lumbar spine area. A peripheral blood examination showed a WBC count of 91,800/microL (neutrophil 88%) with a rare immature form, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL and a platelet count of 1,661,000/microL. Her NAP score was 58. The bone marrow examination showed 95% cellularity, with an M:E ratio of 10:1, increased megakaryocytes with normal morphology and the absence of myelofibrosis. Chromosomal studies showed no Philadelphia chromosome. A radiological examination showed compression fractures of the vertebrae and spinal cord compression. No underlying disease causing a leukemoid reaction was detected. With iron replacement, the hemoglobin level failed to increase over 12 g/dL. Therefore, it was concluded to be a transition of PV to CNL. After administration of hydroxyurea and vertebroplasty, the symptom improved and the WBC count was sustained below 40,000/microL.",English,0.0
Journal Article,S. T. Lee; J. F. Chen,2004.0,Closed reduction vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Technical note,", ","The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and feasibility of closed reduction vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Two hundred consecutive patients (183 women and 17 men) with single-level osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were included in this study. After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed prone on an operating table. Closed reduction of the fractured and kyphotic spine was achieved by extending the table to restore the kyphotic angle and vertebral body (VB) height. Percutaneous vertebroplasty was then performed to treat the fractured vertebra. The results were quantitatively evaluated, according to the concept of estimated VB height. The anterior, middle, and posterior VB heights of the fractured vertebra were measured preoperatively and immediately after surgery by studying plain standing lateral radiographs. In 162 (81%) of the compression fractures the anterior VB height was restored (57.1 +/- 24.8% of lost anterior VB height); in 152 (76%) of the compression fractures the middle VB height was restored (61.4 +/- 20.6% of lost middle VB height); and in 52 (26%) of the compression fractures the posterior VB height was restored (51.3 +/- 23.1% of lost posterior VB height). In 141 (71.5%) of the compression fractures kyphosis was corrected by 12.5 +/- 3.8 degrees [mean 61.6 +/- 23.7%]). Closed reduction vertebroplasty is an efficacious and simple method in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture and was able to restore the VB height and kyphotic angle in postions of fractured vertebrae. Its associated, long-term effects on treated vertebrae, however, need further evaluation.",eng,0.0

The consistency of the bone cement mixture during the procedure would appear to be increasing with time, but the physician experiences injection difficulty, and there are also concerns with the limited injection time available for such a procedure.
METHODS: We describe a special-design screw-syringe compressor to be used with the ordinary 10 mL Luer-Lok syringe and a short connecting tube for the injection of bone cement during VP.
RESULTS: The syringe compressor could yield maximum 2,772 psi compression pressure and could finely control the cement delivery rate to 0.2 mL/ a turn. We have used this technique to treat 296 consecutive patients with 384 vertebral compression fractures who were suffering from disabling back pain refractory to analgesic therapy. Using this technique, the injection time can be prolonged to 12 min and the delivery volume can be better controlled.
CONCLUSION: With the aid of the syringe compressor, the cementing material can be accurately and steadily injected as desired by the physician. Bone-cement injection can be better controlled with this syringe compressor. Furthermore, this delivery system would reduce per treatment cost.",English,0.0

However, some patient populations experience recurrent vertebral fracture after initial successful procedure. There are a lot of literatures about the effectiveness of this procedure but few concerning the development of recurrent, new compression fracture. This is a retrospective review of all PVPs performed in author's institution from September 1999 to December 2001 to investigate the factors related to the development of new symptomatic OVCFs after PVPs. A retrospective review of 244 cases of PVP for symptomatic OVCFs at 382 levels was performed. Sociodemographic, clinical, radiologic, and procedural data were analyzed and compared between the two patient groups (control group : no further symptomatic OVCFs after the initial PVP, new symptomatic fracture"" group: with newly developed symptomatic OVCF). Statistical analysis was performed between the variables of the two groups. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Over all, 38 among 244 treated patients (15.6%) had experienced newly developed symptomatic OVCF(s) during the follow up period (mean 52.5 months). Old age and the presence of multiple treated vertebrae at the initial PVP were assessed as a strong parameter for predicting new symptomatic OVCF. With increasing preoperative wedging deformity the risk of developing new symptomatic OVCF decreased. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 1 year fracture-free rate was 92.2%. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that 7.8% of the patients would experience new symptomatic OVCF within 1 year after initial PVP. A preoperative only mild wedge deformity of the fractured vertebra(e) could indicate the increased risk of developing new symptomatic OVCF after vertebroplasty.""",eng,1.0

A prospective open study was conducted. PVP were carried out between July 1995 and September 2000 for 16 patients with symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fracture that had not responded to extensive conservative medical therapy. All the patients were followed-up for more than 1 year. The efficacy of the PVP was assessed by the changes over time in pain on Huskisson's visual analog scale (VAS) and on the McGill-Melzack scoring system (MGM). The efficacy of the procedure was also assessed by measuring the changes over time in quality of life assessed by the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP instrument): twenty-one vertebrae treated by PVP in 16 patients were evaluated. The mean duration of follow-up was 35 months. Pain assessed by the VAS significantly decreased from a mean of 71.4 mm+/-13 before PVP to 36 mm+/-30 after 6 months, and to 39 mm+/-33 at the time of maximal follow-up ( p<0.05 for both comparisons). The results were also significant for the MGM: 3.00+/-0.57 before PVP to 1.6+/-1.4 at the long-term follow-up ( p<0.05). The solely statistically significant decrease for quality of life was noted for pain. A slight but not significant improvement was noted for 3/6 dimensions of the NHP scores. A slight but significant increase in social isolation was also found. No severe complication occurred immediately after PVP. At the long term follow-up (35 months) there was a slight but not significantly increased risk of vertebral fracture in the vicinity of a cemented vertebra: odds ratio 3.18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-19.64). The odds ratio of a vertebral fracture in the vicinity of an uncemented fractured vertebra was 2.14 (95% CI: 0.17-26.31). In conclusion, PVP appears to be safe and effective for treating persistent painful osteoporotic fractures.

We report the results of vertebroplasty for painful vertebral body compression fractures in a small cohort of patients with dementia with the assumption that this patient subgroup is subjected to a decreased placebo effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with objective evidence of dementia (N = 10) who had undergone vertebroplasty at our institution were identified from a comprehensive prospectively constructed vertebroplasty data base. The patients' pain at rest and activity, mobility, and pain-medication use were analyzed at 2 hours postprocedure, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. RESULTS: Pain with activity decreased or resolved in 80%-100% of patients at each time point, whereas pain at rest decreased or resolved in 78%-100% of all patients at each time point. Improved mobility was reported in 80%-100% of patients at all time points. Pain medication was decreased or stopped in 67% of patients at 1 week and in 100% of patients at 6 months and 1 year.

DATA SOURCES: Extensive literature review of osteoporosis, vertebroplasty, and kyphoplasty supplemented by case study and clinical experience in the minimally invasive interventional neuroradiology interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis is a progressive debilitating process that destroys the cancellous bone, weakening the overall integrity and stability of the bone. The loss of bone mass places the individual at increased risk for vertebral body, hip, and wrist fractures. In the past, there was no treatment option to repair vertebral body deformity or instability after osteoporotic VCFs. Management solely relied on the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, muscle relaxants, and/or orthotic bracing to provide pain relief. VCFs alter the stability of the vertebral body and column, and the lack of stabilization can lead to chronic pain syndrome, immobility, pulmonary compromise, progression of spinal deformity, increase in the risk for additional VCFs, and increase in the risk for comorbidities and mortality related to immobility. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive procedures aimed at pain control, stabilization of the vertebral body, and with kyphoplasty, the ability to provide some correction of deformity with partial restoration of vertebral body height. Providing pain control and stabilization of the vertebral column improves mobility, thus decreasing the potential risks associated with immobility.",eng,0.0

This procedure only recently has been introduced, and is being used for patients with lytic lesions due to bone metastases, aggressive hemangiomas, or multiple myeloma, and for patients who have medically intractable debilitating pain resulting from osteoporotic vertebral collapse.
FINDINGS: Results from two uncontrolled prospective studies and several case series reports, including one with 187 patients, indicate that percutaneous vertebroplasty can produce significant pain relief and increase mobility in 70 percent to 80 percent of patients with osteolytic lesions in the vertebrae from hemangiomas, metastases, or myeloma, or with osteoporotic compression fractures. In these reports, pain relief was apparent within one to two days after injection, and persisted for at least several months up to several years. While experimental studies and preliminary clinical results suggest that percutaneous vertebroplasty can also strengthen the vertebral bodies and increase mobility, it remains to be proven whether this procedure can prevent additional fractures in the injected vertebrae. In addition, the duration of effect is not known; there were no long-term follow-up data on most of these patients, and these data may be difficult to obtain and interpret in patients with an underlying malignant process, because disease progression may confound evaluation of the treatment effect. Complications were relatively rare, although some studies reported a high incidence of clinically insignificant leakage of bone cement into the paravertebral tissues. In a few cases, the leakage of polymer caused compression of spinal nerve roots or neuralgia. Several instances of pulmonary embolism were also reported. Although patient selection criteria have not been definitely established, percutaneous vertebroplasty is considered appropriate treatment for patients with vertebral lesions resulting from osteolytic metastasis and myeloma, hemangioma, and painful osteoporotic compression fractures if the following criteria have been met: o Severe debilitating pain or loss of mobility that cannot be relieved by correct medical therapy. o Other causes of pain, such as herniated intervertebral disk have been ruled out by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. o The affected vertebra has not been extensively destroyed and is at least one third of its original height. o Radiation therapy or concurrent surgical interventions, such as laminectomy, may also be required in patients with compression of the spinal cord due to ingrowth of a tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty has only recently been introduced as a treatment for osteolytic lesions and osteoporotic compression fractures of the vertebrae, but early results are promising. Up to 80 percent of patients with pain unresponsive to correct medical treatment experience a significant degree of pain relief, and few serious complications have been reported. However, relatively few patients have undergone this procedure, and there are no data from controlled clinical trials or from studies with long-term follow-up. At the present time this procedure is still in the investigational stages, but may be appropriate for patients with no other reasonable options for medical treatment.",English,0.0

METHODS: A retrospective review of medical records was performed of patients seen at Emory University Spine Center and Hospital (Atlanta, Georgia) for vertebral fracture between 1998 and 2007. Patients with vertebral fracture or who underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty were identified by use of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Current Procedural Terminology codes, respectively. Outcome measures included site and date of recurrent vertebral fractures and mortality. RESULTS: We identified 250 patients with vertebral fractures and classified them into 4 groups: surgical therapy only, surgical plus medical treatment, medical therapy only, and no treatment. There was no significant difference in the cumulative survival rates among the 4 study groups nor between the treatment groups. There was, however, a significant difference in the cumulative refracture-free rates among the 4 study groups (P<.0001). Recurrent fracture-free rates were highest in the group that received no treatment. The 2-year cumulative refracture-free rates were 95.9%, 84.8%, 81.7%, and 68.5%, respectively, for the no treatment, medical therapy only, surgical treatment only, and medical plus surgical therapy groups. Recurrent fracture-free rates were significantly different for patients who received surgical or medical or surgical plus medical therapy (P=.0007), with patients in the medical plus surgical group having the shortest time to refracture, although these patients may have been sicker and more frail than the other groups. CONCLUSION: We found that surgical treatment with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty did not decrease recurrent vertebral fractures in patients presenting with an initial vertebral fracture. Medical and surgical therapies together may shorten the time to refracture, but the observed elevated risk may be due to other confounding factors. We found no difference in survival in patients undergoing kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty in comparison with medical or no treatment groups. The relationship between surgical and medical therapy and vertebral refracture rates should be further evaluated with use of a prospective cohort design.",eng,0.0

These procedures involve percutaneous delivery of a bolus of an injectable bone cement either directly to the fractured vertebral body, VB (VP) or to a void created in it by an inflatable bone tamp (BKP). Thus, the cement is a vital component of both procedures. In the vast majority of VPs and BKPs, a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement is used. This material has many shortcomings, notably lack of bioactivity and very limited resorbability. Thus, there is room for alternative cements. We report here on two variants of a novel, bioactive, Al-free, Zn-based glass polyalkenoate cement (Zn-GPC), and how their properties compare to those of an injectable PMMA bone cement (SIMPL) that is widely used in VP and BKP. The properties determined were injectability, radiopacity, uniaxial compressive strength, and biaxial flexural modulus. In addition, we compared the compression fatigue lives of a validated synthetic osteoporotic VB model (a polyurethane foam cube with an 8 mm-diameter through-thickness cylindrical hole), at 0-2300 N and 3 Hz, when the hole was filled with each of the three cements. A critical review of the results suggests that the performance of each of the Zn-GPCs is comparable to that of SIMPL; thus, the former cements merit further study with a view to being alternatives to an injectable PMMA cement for use in VP and BKP.",English,0.0

All patients were followed up 12-38 months (mean, 18.5 months). Postoperatively, complete pain relief was achieved in 31 cases and partial pain relief in 3 cases; no re-fracture or loosening at the interface occurred. At 3 days after operation and last follow-up, the anterior and middle vertebral column height, Cobb angle, and visual analogue scale (VAS) score were improved significantly when compared with those before operation (P < 0.05); and there was no significant difference between 3 days and last follow-up (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Confidence high viscosity bone cement system and postural reduction can be employed safely in treating acute severe OVCF, which has many merits of high viscosity, long time for injection, and easy-to-control directionally.",chi,0.0

Dong,2016.0,Minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation combined with percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture,10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.11.003,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation (MIPS) combined with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) using calcium phosphate for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficits. METHODS: Between September 2011 and April 2013, a total of thirty-seven patients with a mean age of 50.73 years (range 40-63 years), who suffered from thoracic or lumbar burst fracture without neurologic deficits underwent the procedure of MIPS combined with PVP using calcium phosphate. The preoperative and postoperative pain assessment were evaluated using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA). The Cobb angles and central and anterior columns height were measured on the lateral radiographs before surgery and immediately, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: The patients were followed up for an average of 27.54 +/- 2.47 months. The mean VAS significantly decreased from 9 (range 6-10) before surgery 2 (range 1-3) immediately after surgery and 1 (range 0-2) at 2-yearA follow-up. The Cobb angle was 22.58 +/- 1.70 degrees before surgery and 4.11 +/- 1.41 degrees immediately after surgery and 5.06 +/- 1.11 degrees at 2-year follow-up. The central and anterior vertebral body height decreased from 44.10 +/- 7.0% and 49.76 +/- 6.43% before surgery to 80.09 +/- 4.05% and 93.31 +/- 1.87% immediately after surgery, respectively. No significant changes in vertebral body height restoration were observed during 2 years follow-up after surgery. In addition, there were no instrumentation failure and complications in all patients.

Vertebroplasty for treatment of osteoporotic burst fracture is controversial. We want to clarify whether the osteoporotic burst fracture with spinal canal compromise is a contraindication to percutaneous vertebroplasty. To compare the clinical and radiological results between osteoporotic burst and compression fractures treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2005 through 2006, 23 osteoporotic burst fracture patients with asymptomatic spinal canal compromise and 41 osteoporotic compression fracture patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty. Pre- and post-operative pain scores, functional and radiographic results and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: The average canal compromise in study group was 15% (5-49%). The mean post-operative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analogue Score (VAS), kyphotic angle, vertebral body height measurement from the anterior, central and posterior part of the body are all significantly improved in both the study and control groups when compared to pre-operative data. However, there was no significant difference between study and control groups in pre- and post-operative ODI, VAS, kyphotic angle and improvement of body height. There were no significant differences (P=0.3797) in cement leakage rate between burst and compression groups (47.8% vs 36.6%). All the leakages were minor and without neurological deficit. The percentage of adjacent fractures in both groups also had no significant differences (39.1% in burst and 41.5% in compression group). CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporotic burst fracture with asymptomatic spinal canal compromise is not a contraindication for percutaneous vertebroplasty. This procedure is suitable for both osteoporotic burst and compression fracture with careful surgical technique.",eng,1.0

Clinical symptoms of OVCFs include severe pain, loss of vertebral height, progressive kyphosis and increased mortality. Jack vertebral dilator kyphoplasty is a recently developed OVCFs treatment modality, with few systematic studies present in the literature. This retrospective study was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Jack vertebral dilator kyphoplasty for treating thoracolumbar OVCFs. Sixteen elderly patients (55-85 years) with solitary thoracolumbar OVCFs were treated with this procedure and followed-up (10-27 months). The amount of injected bone cement and operative time, preoperative and postoperative visual analogue scores, anterior and middle vertebral body heights, local kyphosis angle, and complications was analysed. The results showed that the method provided long-term pain relief and restoration of the vertebral body height and spinal alignment. No serious complications occurred, but two patients experienced recompression of the vertebral body, and one patient experienced cement leakage into a disc.

In about 10% of patients, nonunion develops and warrants surgical management with minimally invasive procedures such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Nevertheless, for patients with nonunion fractures that involve the posterior vertebral body wall, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are relatively contraindicated due to the risk of extravertebral polymethylmethacrylate cement leakage through vertebral fracture cracks. To this end, we developed a method for pedicle screw fixation combined with transpedicular bone grafting for such a condition. Briefly, after posterior pedicle screw fixation and reduction in the affected vertebra, the demineralized bone matrix was inserted into the vertebral body via a 'bone grafting funnel' created through the pedicle of the affected vertebra. The current retrospective study analysed the safety and efficacy of this approach. A total of 12 patients who fulfilled the criteria were treated with this procedure. Visual analogue scale scores for back pain and anterior vertebral heights were recorded. At 3-month follow-up, pain was significantly relieved compared with presurgery and the anterior vertebral heights were successfully restored and maintained. In conclusion, short-segment pedicle instrumentation combined with transpedicular bone grafting is a useful alternative in the treatment of nonunion of OVFs with loss of posterior edge integrity.",eng,1.0

Zheng,2006.0,[Advancement in the repair and reconstruction of the injured spine and spinal cord],", ","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the latest research and the therapeutic development in the injuries to the spine and spinal cord. METHODS: Literature concerned was reviewed, combined with our own research and clinical experience, to summarize the trend of the researches and their clinical application in the treatment of the injured spine and spinal cord. RESULTS: The posterior approach atlantoaxial stabilization technique changed the conventional wiring technique into the transarticular screw fixation to the plate and pedicle or the lateral mass screw fixation technique. The clinical application of the transoralpharyngeal atlantoaxial reduction plate fixation technique showed a good effect on the reduction of atlantoaxial dislocation. However, there were no unified criteria for selection of the surgical approach, fixation level, and fusion mode in the treatment of thoracolumbar spinal fractures. Under optimal conditions, both the anterior and the posterior approaches could achieve good clinical effects on decompression and spinal reconstruction. The single level fixation technique showed some advantages in treating certain types of thoracolumbar spinal fractures when compared with the traditional cross-sectional fixation. The endoscopy-assistant and image-guiding spinal intervention techniques were evolved in China during these years. In the treatment of the obstinate painful osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture, percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty achieved good results in the pain relief and spinal reconstruction. Numerous basic and clinical researches have given us a further understanding of the medical protection of acute spinal cord injury, and biological treatments have given us new ideas on neural reparation and regeneration. Cell transplantation and gene therapy have become the most promising treatment strategies in this field.

Cao,2015.0,An MRI-based feasibility study of unilateral percutaneous vertebroplasty,10.1186/s12891-015-0619-x,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of osteoporotic fracture. The bilateral pedicular approach is the most frequently used method. However, unilateral PVP is becoming increasingly more attractive for surgeons because of its numerous benefits, including lower radiation exposure, less tissue injury, and less bone cement leakage. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anatomical feasibility of unilateral PVP by exploring the differences in the puncture success rate of the unilateral pedicular approach among different lumbar segments, between men and women, and between the left and right sides. METHODS: Punctures were simulated on magnetic resonance imaging scans of 200 patients (100 men, 100 women) at a maximum angle via a pedicular approach. The distance between the entry point and the midline of the vertebral body, the maximum puncture angle, the puncture success value, and the puncture success rate were measured and compared among different lumbar levels, between the two sexes, and between the left and right sides. RESULTS: The maximum puncture distance between the entry point and the midline gradually increased from L1 to L5, and the maximum puncture angle showed the same tendency from L1 to L5. The puncture success values for L3 and L4 were higher than those for the other lumbar levels (L1, 31.53 +/- 34.45; L2, 42.15 +/- 28.06; L3, 56.21 +/- 18.30; L4, 56.20 +/- 12.93; and L5, 48.01 +/- 6.88). The puncture success rates varied from 69.5 to 98.0 % among the different lumbar levels; L3 and L4 were the two highest (L3, 95.5 %; L4, 98.0 %). There were significant differences in these measurements between men and women and between the left and right sides. CONCLUSIONS: PVP with the unilateral puncture approach appears more likely to succeed at L3 to L5 than at L1 and L2. The unilateral approach might be more suitable for men than women at levels other than L5. Additionally, the left pedicular approach might be optimal for unilateral PVP procedures.",eng,0.0

The aim of the following study was to evaluate the feasibility of a unilateral, three-dimensional (3D), accurate puncture in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for a single, severely osteoporotic vertebral body compression fracture (ssOVCFs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 57 patients received PVP in the current study. Feasibility of a unilateral approach was judged before surgery using the 64-slice helical computed tomography (CT) multiplanar reconstruction technique, a 3D accurate puncture plan was then determined. The skin bone distance, puncture angle and needle insertion depth were recorded during surgery. 2D CT rechecking was performed for any complication at day 1 after operation. Preoperative and postoperative numerical data were compared. RESULTS: The procedure was completed smoothly in all patients. 2D CT scanning at day 1 after operation did not show any puncture related complications. Visual analog scoring (VAS) showed that the score at day 3 after surgery was reduced to 1.7 +/- 0.4 (0-2.9 scale) from the preoperative 7.9 +/- 2.1 (6.1-9.5 scale). No significant differences in measure numerical data were found before and after the surgery. At 12 months followup three patients presented with nonadjacent level fractures, VAS for other patients were 1.2 +/- 0.3 (0-2.1 scale).

METHODS: A 76-year-old woman with acute OVCF (L1 level) accepted a novel precise PVP. A 3D model of thoracolumbar vertebrae (T12-L2) based on preoperative CT scanning data and a simulative PVP (via bilateral transpedicular approach) were built in Materiaise's interactive medical image control system (MIMICS) software. With the help of three radiopaque markers located at back skin and preoperative digital design by MIMICS software, bilateral skin entry points, needles direction including abduction angle and head inclination angle, and needles insertion depth were established. RESULTS: During surgery, only 1 shot of fluoroscopy was required to confirm the skin entry points. The operation took about only 23 minutes and total patient exposure dose was 4.5 mSv. The intraoperative radiological results showed the cement distribution in L1 vertebra was very good without any puncture-related complications. The VAS score of the patient improved from preoperative 9 points to postoperative 2 points.

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the safety of single-stage multisegmental thoracolumbar PVP. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The PVP is a minimally invasive surgery. It is mainly used in the treatment of individuals with serious back pain caused by osteoporotic compression fracture, vertebral metastatic tumors, symptomatic vertebral hemangioma, and multiple myeloma. METHODS: A total of 50 patients underwent the PVP on 3 or more vertebras compared with 50 cases of PVP on 1 or 2 vertebras. Assessment indexes of safety were: operation time, intraoperative blood pressure change, intraoperative oxyhemoglobin saturation change, intraoperative mental state of patients, postoperative x-ray examination, and results of computed tomography and complications. RESULTS: (1) Average operation time of group A was 125 minutes and that of group B was 56 minutes. (2) Change in arterial pressure of group A was more significant compared with group B, when assessed using the chi test. (3) Pain intensity of group A was compared with group B and a statistical difference was seen only in the patients who underwent PVP on 3 or more vertebras on the first day after surgery. (4) Change in oxyhemoglobin saturation (decreased under 90%) of group A was found to be more significant compared with group B, when assessed using the chi test. (5) No statistical difference in emotional state was found between the 2 groups. (6) There were 4 cases of perivertebral leakage, 1 case of intrapulmonary leakage, and 2 cases of symptoms of intercostal nerve stimulation in group A and 3 cases of perivertebral leakage, 1 case of intrapulmonary leakage, and 1 case of symptoms of intercostal nerve stimulation in group B. CONCLUSIONS: High risk exists in single-stage multisegmental thoracolumbar percutaneous vertebroplasty, especially during puncture and bone cement injection, which may cause wide fluctuation of blood pressure and reduce oxygen saturation sharply; however, the surgery is safe to a certain extent, although it requires close intraoperative supervision and shortened operation time.",eng,0.0

Polymethylmethacrylate has been used for augmentation of VCFs; however, there are cement complications, and long-term fracture healing is unknown. The transpedicle body augmenter (TpBA), a porous titanium spacer, has been reported as an internal support to reconstruct the vertebral body combining short segment fixation in burst fracture. We retrospectively reviewed radiographic and clinical results of TpBA vertebroplasty for single symptomatic VCF in 80 patients. Manual reduction and TpBA vertebroplasty via a paramedian incision with blunt dissection was done. Mean age was 72.3 years (range 51-87 years), and female-male ratio was 66:14. The mean symptom duration was 5 months, and follow-up 44 months. Peri-operative variables and radiographic and clinical results were evaluated. The average operation time was 26.1 min, blood loss 92 cc, and hospitalization 2.3 days. No patient had neurological deterioration. TpBA was found sinking into vertebral body initially, then locked by residual cortex, and finally stabilized within the vertebra. There was no dislodgement of TpBA in the final visit. Sixty-two patients (77.5%) could walk within 3-6 h after operation and the others within 24 h. The anterior vertebral restoration was 8.0 mm initially and 6.1 mm at final follow-up.

Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) SMDs at short- and long-term follow-up were not statistically significant (-0.04, P = 0.77 and -0.07, P = 0.74, respectively). This meta-analysis showed greater polymethylmethacrylate volume (SMD -1.08, P = 0.00) and operation time (SMD -2.40, P = 0.00), favoring unipedicular PKP. Radiographic outcomes-preoperative kyphosis angle, restoration rate, reduction angle, loss of reduction angle-were not statistically different between the groups. Pooled analyses of cement leakage and subsequent adjacent OVCFs showed no significant differences between the groups, with OR = 0.82 (P = 0.79) and OR = 1.41 (P = 0.70), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis comparing unipedicular and bipedicular PKP demonstrated no significant differences regarding VAS, ODI, radiographic outcomes, or complications.

Of 31 cases, 10 were male and 21 were female, aged from 64 to 80 years (mean, 70.7 years). All fractures were caused by mild trauma with an disease duration of 1-13 days. Affected vertebrae included T12 in 8 cases, L1 in 9 cases, L2 in 12 cases, and L4 in 2 cases. The effectiveness was evaluated with visual analogue scale (VAS), the Cobb's angle, and the anterior vertebral height. RESULTS: The operation was completed successfully in all cases, without serious postoperative complication. Cement leakage occurred in 11 cases (35.5%), including 3 cases at the anterior vertebral edge, 4 cases at the lateral vertebra, and 4 cases at the puncture tunnel. All the cases were followed up 6-15 months (mean, 11 months). The mean fracture healing time was 11.5 weeks (range, 8-12 weeks).

Previous researches have reported unsuspected malignancies found by biopsy. However, the safety and cost-effective profiles of routine biopsy during PKP are unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of routine biopsy during PKP in treatment of VCF. METHODS: Ninety-three patients (September 2007-November 2010) undergoing PKP without biopsy were reviewed as the control group. One hundred and three consecutive patients (November 2010-September 2013) undergoing PKP with biopsy of every operated vertebral level were prospectively enrolled as the biopsy group. The rate of unsuspected lesions was reported, and the severe adverse events, surgical duration, cement leakage rate and pain control were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups, regarding the severe adverse events, surgical duration, cement leakage rate and pain control. Four unsuspected lesions were found in the biopsy group, three of which were malignancies with a 2.9% (3/103) unsuspected malignancy rate. The economic analysis showed that routine biopsy was cost-effective in finding new malignancies comparing with a routine cancer screening campaign.

He refused to receive the surgical intervention, but had not strict compliance with oral anti-osteoporotic medications. Ten months postoperatively, refracture of osteoporotic vertebral body concurrent with cement fragmentation occurred at the previously kyphoplasty-treated vertebral level. Bone mineral analysis showed severe osteoporosis with a T-score of -4.0. The patient finally obtained therapeutic benefit of pain relief and bony union of T12 vertebral body by consistently adhering to anti-osteoporotic medication treatment. This case illustrated that patients who underwent kyphoplasty to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with intravertebral fracture should be strictly followed up and supervised in their anti-osteoporotic medication treatment. The interdigitation injection pattern of PMMA and sufficient PMMA filling with trabeculae in the kyphoplasty procedure also might prevent refracture of the cemented vertebrae concurrent with PMMA fragmentation.",eng,0.0

Zhang,2012.0,Comparison of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty for treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: twelve-month follow-up in a prospective nonrandomized comparative study,10.1097/BSD.0b013e318213c113,"STUDY DESIGN: A prospective nonrandomized comparative study. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty for treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) with respect to pain, functional outcome, radiomorphology, cement leakage, and incidence of new adjacent vertebral fracture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty have become common treatments for painful osteoporotic VCFs. Although the benefits of either kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty compared with conservative treatment have been frequently discussed, few clinical studies are available that directly compare the 2 procedures. METHODS: Ninety-six patients with painful osteoporotic VCFs less than 4 weeks old were included and nonrandomly assigned to undergo kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty treatment. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale and the Oswestry Disability Index. Plain radiographs were analyzed to quantify spinal deformity correction (vertebral body height and kyphotic angle), and evaluate cement leakage and new adjacent vertebral fractures. The follow-up time was 12 months. RESULTS: The baseline clinical and radiological characteristics of both groups were comparable. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to improvement in pain and functional scores at all postoperative intervals. Vertebral height restoration and kyphotic angle reduction were achieved in both groups, but the correction of spinal deformity was more significant in the kyphoplasty group. Asymptomatic cement leakage occurred in 9.1% and 34.6% of treated vertebrae for the kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty groups, respectively. Three adjacent fractures in the kyphoplasty group and 2 in the vertebroplasty group were identified during the follow-up time, and no major adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty demonstrated similar good clinical outcomes during the 12-month follow-up. Kyphoplasty offers a higher degree of spinal deformity correction and results in less cement leakage than vertebroplasty. The benefits of these relative merits need to be ascertained in future long-term studies.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 52 patients with malignant vertebral compression fractures and symptoms of neurological compression were selected for PVP and ITR (n = 24, group A) or PVP alone (n = 28, group B). A 14-G needle and a guidewire were inserted into the vertebral body, followed by sequential dilatation of the tract with the working cannula until the last working cannula reached the distal pedicle of the vertebral arch. ITR was performed with marrow nucleus rongeurs. Then, 5-10 mL cement was injected into the extirpated vertebral body. RESULTS: PVP procedures with and without ITR were successful in all patients, except for one patient in group A. The clinical assessment obtained at the initial and final follow-up indicated that the rates of full recovery and improved neurological compression symptoms were significantly higher in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Treatment of malignant vertebral compression fractures with symptoms of neurological compression with PVP and ITR resulted in better intermediate-term clinical results in terms of improved neurological compression symptoms than the currently recommended approach of PVP. KEY POINTS: * Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is now widely used for vertebral collapse due to malignancy * PVP can be coupled with interventional tumour removal (ITR) * PVP coupled with ITR provided better clinical results for neurological compression * PVP coupled with ITR provided better pain relief * PVP and ITR can remove tumour and helps prevent polymethyl methacrylate leakage.",eng,1.0

There are only a very few literature reports on the use of the finite element analysis (FEA) method to obtain biomechanical parameters of models of spine segments that include BKP augmentation at a given level. In each of these studies, the applied loading used was quasi-static. During normal activities of daily living, the patient's spine would be subject to dynamically-applied loading. Thus, the question of the influence of the characteristics of a dynamically-applied loading cycle on biomechanical parameters of a spine that includes BKP-augmented segment(s) is germane; however, a study of this issue is lacking. We investigated this issue in the present FEA work, with the spine segment model being the L1-L3 motion segment units (MSUs) (a segment that is commonly augmented using BKP) and prophylactic BKP simulated at L2. The dynamic load was the compressive load-versus-time cycle to which the L3-L4 MSU is subjected during gait. Four cases of the cycle were considered, corresponding to slow-, normal-, fast- and very fast-paced gait. The loading cycle was applied to the superior surface of L1 while the inferior surface of L3 was fully constrained. It was found that (1) the global mean von Mises stress during the loading cycle (sigmaVMG), in each tissue in the model increased in going from a slow-paced gait cycle to a very fast-paced gait cycle; and (2) for the slow-paced gait cycle, with increase in frequency of the cycle, f (1 </= f </= 3 Hz), sigmaVMG in each of these tissues increased.

METHODS: Between November 2005 and October 2013, 82 elderly patients with fresh thoracolumbar vertebral fracture were first treated with hyperextension postural reduction and then with high viscosity bone cement in unilateral pedicle puncture PVP. Of 82 cases, 25 were male and 57 were female with an average age of 72.3 years (range, 61-90 years). The causes included falling injury in 28 cases, sprain injury in 11 cases, car shock injury in 4 cases, fracture by cough or sneeze in 6 cases, and no obvious reason in 33 cases. The time from injury to operation was 3-15 days (mean, 7.6 days). Single segment was involved in 74 cases, and double segments in 8 cases. The operation time, fluoroscopy time, intraoperative blood loss, and hospitalization time were recorded, bone cement leakage was observed; pain visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate pain relief effect; X-ray films were taken for measurement of the Cobb angle and anterior vertebral body height compression ratio to evaluate the correction effect. RESULTS: The average operation time was 16 minutes; the average fluoroscopy time was 48 seconds; the average hospitalization time was 3 days. All cases were followed up from 6 to 18 months (mean, 6.8 months). Leakage of bone cement occurred in 6 cases (7.3%), including 3 cases of paravertebral soft tissue leakage, 1 case of intervertebral disc leakage, and 2 cases of venous leakage. There was no nerve damage or paralysis. At last follow-up, VAS score was significantly decreased to 1.3 +/- 0.9 from preoperative 8.8 +/- 1.2 (t = 73.891, P = 0.000); Cobb angle was significantly reduced to (25.06 +/- 6.18) degrees from preoperative (34.79 +/- 7.18) degrees (t = 18.878, P = 0.000); and the anterior vertebral body height compression ratio was significantly increased to 67.8% +/- 5.7% from preoperative 41.3% +/- 9.8% (t = 36.880, P =0.000).

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the risk factors for subsequent fractures after vertebroplasty and to predict the postoperative fracture-free time and rate. The effect of bone cement volume injected was also evaluated. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies of subsequent fractures after vertebroplasty showed conflicting conclusions about risk factors. The frequency of refracture also varied, ranging from 12% to 52%. Most new fractures occurred at adjacent levels, with different risk factors identified. No data were available on the effect of injected bone cement volume, and no consensus had been reached as to the optimal cement volume. METHODS: All enrolled patients were treated with single-level vertebroplasty and followed a standardized postoperative care protocol. Data from medical records and radiographs were collected and analyzed. Variables included patient constitutional factors, radiographic parameters, and volume of injected bone cement. RESULTS: A total of 166 patients (76 men, 90 women) with a mean age of 73.4 years were enrolled in this study. The mean follow-up time was 15.3 months. The overall refracture rate was 38%, with a mean fracture-free interval of 32 months. Both a greater volume of bone cement injected and a greater degree of vertebral height restored contributed significantly to the risk of subsequent adjacent fracture. No risk factor for subsequent remote fracture was identified. A greater volume of bone cement injected was positively correlated with deformity correction after vertebroplasty. CONCLUSION: Most subsequent fractures occurred at the adjacent level within the first 3 months. Patient preoperative condition did not help predict refracture. Although a greater volume of bone cement injected when performing vertebroplasty contributed to the risk of subsequent adjacent fracture, it resulted in a greater improvement of kyphosis.",eng,1.0

However, rotating the C-arm fluoroscope for different radiographic views of the spine can be time-consuming, causing delay in detecting cement leakage. We retrospectively reviewed the results of minimally invasive vertebroplasty utilizing two C-arm fluoroscopes in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Forty-two patients (50 vertebrae) were treated with minimally invasive vertebroplasty under the guidance of two C-arm fluoroscopes. The mean operation time, patient satisfaction rate and the incidences of cement leakage or infection were used to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the two C-arm fluoroscopic technique in performing minimally invasive vertebroplasty. The mean follow-up duration was 17.4 months (range 6 approximately 36). The mean operation time was 37+/-14 minutes. Thirty patients (71%) were very satisfied or satisfied with the procedure. Cement leakages were identified in nine patients (nine vertebrae, 18%). Only one vertebra had a posterior leakage into spinal canal, which did not cause neurologic deficits. No wound infection was observed. This study indicates that the two C-arm fluoroscopic technique provides simultaneous antero-posterior and lateral radiographic views, and therefore may reduce the operation time. No symptomatic cement leakage or wound infection was noted in this investigation. Moreover, no additional staff is needed to rotate the C-arm for fluoroscopy. The proposed technique has been shown to be effective and useful for performing minimally invasive vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

Technically, single fluoroscope is considered sufficient for effectively monitoring PV. However, single fluoroscopic technique might be time-consuming in rotating the C-arm of the fluoroscope for either antero-posterior (AP) or lateral radiographic view, and causing delay in detecting cement leakage that can occur if the correct sight is not given. The aim of the current investigation was to compare the efficacy and safety of performing PV using one or two sets of fluoroscope. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 43 patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures and they were treated with one-level PV. A single orthopaedic surgeon operated on all these patients. The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the method of fluoroscopic control. In Group 1 (15 patients), PV was performed under the assistance of one fluoroscope. In Group 2 (28 patients), PV was performed under the control of two fluoroscopes. The mean follow-up was 19 months (range, 12 to 30). RESULTS: Neither symptomatic cement leakage nor postoperative infection was found in both groups. The mean operation time in Group 2 was shorter, 37.8 vs. 31.0 minutes for Groups 1 and 2, P = 0.03. The incidence of cement leakage for Groups 1 and 2 was 26.7% (4/15) vs. 14.3% (4/28), respectively, P = 0.19. CONCLUSION: We found that the two-fluoroscopic technique can provide simultaneous, real-time AP and lateral radiographic views to monitor entry point and cement delivery for PV and therefore reduce the operation time.

The two-fluoroscopic technique (two-plane radiographs obtained using two fluoroscopes) during PV can provide simultaneous two-planar projections with reducing operative time. However, the two-fluoroscopic technique may expose the operator or patient to increased radiation dose. The aim of this study was to quantify the amount of radiation exposure to the patient or operator that occurs during PV using one- vs. two-fluoroscopic technique. METHODS: Two radiation dosimeters were placed on the right flank of each patient and on the upper sternum of each operator during 26 single-level PV procedures by one senior surgeon. The use of two-fluoroscopic technique (13 patients) and one-fluoroscopic technique (13 patients) were allocated in a consecutive and alternative manner. The operative time and mean radiation dose to each patient and operator were monitored and compared between groups. RESULTS: Mean radiation dose to the patient was 1.97+/-1.20 mSv (95% CI, 0.71 to 3.23) for the one-fluoroscopic technique group vs. 0.95+/-0.34 mSv (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.23) for the two-fluoroscopic technique group (P=0.031). Mean radiation dose to the operator was 0.27+/-0.12 mSv (95% CI, 0.17-0.56) for the one-fluoroscopic technique group vs. 0.25+/-0.14 mSv (95% CI, 0.06-0.44) for the two-fluoroscopic technique group (P=0.653). The operative time was significantly different between groups: 47.15+/-13.48 min (range, 20-75) for the one-fluoroscopic technique group vs. 36.62+/-8.42 min (range, 21-50) for the two-fluoroscopic technique group (P=0.019). CONCLUSION: Compared to the one-fluoroscopic technique, the two-fluoroscopic technique used during PV provides not only shorter operative times but also reduces the radiation exposure to the patient. There was no significant difference between the two techniques with regards to radiation exposure to the operator.",eng,0.0

The purpose of this study is to retrospectively compare KP with VP in pain improvement, cement leakage incidence, and the cost of treatment of malignant VCF. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of clinical data for 80 patients with multiple spinal metastases, treated with KP in 42 cases and VP in 38. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were collected pre-operatively, post-operatively, at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after treatment. Cement leakage was identified using fluoroscopy and CT scan. Total cost per patient was also collected. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the pre- and post-operative VAS scores (7.4 +/- 2.0 to 3.8 +/- 1.6, P < 0.001 in the KP group; 6.7 +/- 2.4 to 3.7 +/- 1.4, P < 0.001 in the VP group), and was maintained at 1-year follow-up (3.2 +/- 1.4 in the KP group, 3.1 +/- 1.3 in the VP group). However, the difference in VAS score between these two groups was insignificant at baseline and every follow-up assessment post-operatively (P > 0.05). The incidence of cement leakage in the KP group was lower than that of the VP group (16.9% (14/83) vs 30.3% (23/76), P < 0.05). However, none of the patients developed any symptoms. The length of postoperative hospital stay in the VP group was shorter than that of the KP group ((2.4 +/- 1.3) vs (5.3 +/- 1.9) days, P < 0.05). Total hospital cost in the KP group was much higher than that of the VP group (RMB Yuan 8 492 +/- 3 332 vs RMB Yuan 3 173 +/- 1 341, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: VP and KP are both effective in providing pain relief for patients with cancer-related VCF. KP provides no greater degree of pain improvement. KP is associated with a lower rate of cement leakage compared with VP. VP is associated with lower cost and shorter postoperative hospital stay in China.",eng,1.0

All patients who received vertebral augmentation for vertebral compression fractures were evaluated. The collected data included patient characteristics (demographics, comorbidities, and medication exposure) and repeat vertebral augmentation. Kaplan-Meier and stratified Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed for analyses. RESULTS: The overall incidence of repeat vertebral augmentation was 11.3% during the follow-up until 2010. Patients with the following characteristics were at greater risk for repeat vertebral augmentation: female sex (AOR=1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-2.36), advanced age (AOR=1.60; 95% CI: 1.32-2.08), diabetes mellitus (AOR=4.31; 95% CI: 4.05-5.88), cerebrovascular disease (AOR=4.09; 95% CI: 3.44-5.76), dementia (AOR=1.97; 95% CI: 1.69-2.33), blindness or low vision (AOR=3.72; 95% CI: 2.32-3.95), hypertension (AOR=2.58; 95% CI: 2.35-3.47), and hyperlipidemia (AOR=2.09; 95% CI: 1.67-2.22). Patients taking calcium/vitamin D (AOR=2.98; 95% CI: 1.83-3.93), bisphosphonates (AOR=2.11; 95% CI: 1.26-2.61), or calcitonin (AOR=4.59; 95% CI: 3.40-5.77) were less likely to undergo repeat vertebral augmentation; however, those taking steroids (AOR=7.28; 95% CI: 6.32-8.08), acetaminophen (AOR=3.54; 95% CI: 2.75-4.83), or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (AOR=6.14; 95% CI: 5.08-7.41) were more likely to undergo repeat vertebral augmentation.

There were 13 males and 85 females, with a mean age of 77.2 years (range, 54-95 years). The mean disease duration was 43 days (range, 15-120 days), and the mean T score of bone mineral density (BMD) was -3.8 (range, -6.7- -2.5). Bilateral transpedicular approach was used in all the patients. The patients were divided into cement leakage group and no cement leakage group by occurrence of cement leakage based on postoperative CT. Single factor analysis was used to analyze the difference between 2 groups in T score of BMD, operative level, preoperative anterior compression degree of operative vertebrae, preoperative middle compression degree of operative vertebrae, preoperative sagittal Cobb angle of operative vertebrae, preoperative vertebral body wall incompetence, cement volume, and volume ratio of intravertebral bone cement to vertebral body. All relevant factors were introduced to logistic regression analysis to analyze the risk factors of cement leakage. RESULTS: All procedures were performed successfully. The mean operation time was 40 minutes (range, 30-50 minutes), and the mean volume ratio of intravertebral bone cement to vertebral body was 24.88% (range, 7.84%-38.99%). Back pain was alleviated significantly in all the patients postoperatively. All patients were followed up with a mean time of 8 months (range, 6-12 months). Cement leakage occurred in 49 patients.

OBJECTIVE: Review and analyze studies published as of August 2015 that compared clinical outcomes and complications of KP versus VP. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SEARCH METHOD: Published reports up to August 2015 were found in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective cohort stud.ies comparing KP and VP in patients with OVCF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the studies and extracted data. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies involving 3274 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There were significant differences between the two groups in short- and long-term postoperative changes in measures of pain intensity and dysfunction (P < .01), in anterior and middle height (P < .01), kyphotic angle (P < .01), and time to injury, but not in posterior height (P=.178). There were no significant differences in the rate of postoperative fractures including adjacent and total fractures, but cement leakage to the intraspinal space was greater in the VP group (P=.035). KP surgery took longer and required a greater volume of injected cement.

This minimally invasive method, which has been adopted by practitioners during the past decade to treat symptomatic osteoporotic compression fractures is reported to provide quick pain relief in 90% of patients, with only infrequent, mostly minor, complications. In patients with osteolytic fractures, vertebroplasty is associated with an increased rate of cement leak and less predictable pain relief. Kyphoplasty is an extension of vertebroplasty that uses an inflatable bone tamp to restore the vertebral body toward its original height while creating a cavity to be filled with bone cement. Preliminary data indicate that kyphoplasty is a safe procedure associated with a lower risk of cement leak, restoration of vertebral body height, and sagittal spinal alignment. In patients with osteolytic fractures secondary to multiple myeloma, kyphoplasty yields quick pain relief, and is associated with a statistically significant improvement in generic health outcome measures.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of inflatable bone tamp reduction and cement augmentation, kyphoplasty,"" in the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporotic compression fractures can result in progressive kyphosis and chronic pain. Traditional treatment for these patients includes bed rest, analgesics, and bracing. Augmentation of vertebral compression fractures with polymethylmethacrylate, ""vertebroplasty,"" has been used to treat pain. This technique, however, makes no attempt to restore the height of the collapsed vertebral body. Kyphoplasty is a new technique that involves the introduction of inflatable bone tamps into the vertebral body. Once inflated, the bone tamps restore the vertebral body back toward its original height while creating a cavity that can be filled with bone cement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy consecutive kyphoplasty procedures were performed in 30 patients. The indications included painful primary or secondary osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Mean duration of symptoms was 5.9 months. Symptomatic levels were identified by correlating the clinical data with MRI findings. Perioperative variables and bone tamp complications or issues were recorded and analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were compared to calculate the percentage height restored. Outcome data were obtained by comparing preoperative and latest postoperative SF-36 data. RESULTS: At the completion of the Phase I study there were no major complications related directly to use of this technique or use of the inflatable bone tamp. In 70% of the vertebral bodies kyphoplasty restored 47% of the lost height. Cement leakage occurred at six levels (8.6%).SF-36 scores for Bodily Pain 11.6-58.7, (P = 0.0001) and Physical Function 11.7-47.4, (P = 0.002) were among those that showed significant improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The inflatable bone tamp was efficacious in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Kyphoplasty is associated with early clinical improvement of pain and function as well as restoration of vertebral body height in the treatment of painful osteoporotic compression fractures.""",eng,0.0

The filling materials used for both these techniques require good biocompatibility, good biomechanical strength and stiffness, and good radiopacity for the fluoroscopy guided procedures. New filler materials (synthetic bone substitutes, e.g., composite resin materials, calcium phosphate or calcium sulfate cements) in addition to new PMMA formulations are now available for clinical use.

OBJECTIVES: To provide a theoretical framework for understanding and optimizing the biomechanics of vertebroplasty. Specifically, to investigate the effects of volume and distribution of bone cement on stiffness recovery of the vertebral body. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is a treatment that stabilizes a fractured vertebra by addition of bone cement. However, there is currently no information available on the optimal volume and distribution of the filler material in terms of stiffness recovery of the damaged vertebral body. METHODS: An experimentally calibrated, anatomically accurate finite-element model of an elderly L1 vertebral body was developed. Damage was simulated in each element based on empirical measurements in response to a uniform compressive load. After virtual vertebroplasty (bone cement filling range of 1-7 cm3) on the damaged model, the resulting compressive stiffness of the vertebral body was computed for various spatial distributions of the filling material and different loading conditions. RESULTS: Vertebral stiffness recovery after vertebroplasty was strongly influenced by the volume fraction of the implanted cement. Only a small amount of bone cement (14% fill or 3.5 cm3) was necessary to restore stiffness of the damaged vertebral body to the predamaged value. Use of a 30% fill increased stiffness by more than 50% compared with the predamaged value. Whereas the unipedicular distributions exhibited a comparative stiffness to the bipedicular or posterolateral cases, it showed a medial-lateral bending motion (toggle"") toward the untreated side when a uniform compressive pressure load was applied. CONCLUSION: Only a small amount of bone cement ( approximately 15% volume fraction) is needed to restore stiffness to predamage levels, and greater filling can result in substantial increase in stiffness well beyond the intact level. Such overfilling also renders the system more sensitive to the placement of the cement because asymmetric distributions with large fills can promote single-sided load transfer and thus toggle. These results suggest that large fill volumes may not be the most biomechanically optimal configuration, and an improvement might be achieved by use of lower cement volume with symmetric placement.""",eng,0.0

However, there remains a risk of bone cement leakage during and after kyphoplasty, especially in cases with severe vertebral wall destruction or neurological deficits. OBJECTIVE: This article presents a case in which kyphoplasty was used to manage these complications in a woman with vertebral compression fractures caused by tumor metastasis. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Pain management clinic. METHODS: The patient was a 76-year-old woman who had severe low back pain, lower extremity weakness, and cauda equina syndrome because of vertebral compression fracture and spinal metastasis with epidural involvement. The patient had a large bony defect in the vertebra that the bone filler device could pass freely through the anterior body wall. Nevertheless, kyphoplasty was successfully performed by using our new cement injection technique, which is a slow injection of the highly viscous bone cement, followed by a second injection 10 minutes later to allow the previously injected cement to harden. RESULTS: The procedure significantly alleviated all symptoms. The day after the procedure, in the absence of additional pain medication, the pain had dropped dramatically to a numerical rating scale 3-4, and there was an improvement in motor function that allowed the patient to sit and go to the bathroom by herself. In addition, the voiding sensation had returned, which allowed the patient to defecate and urinate normally. LIMITATIONS: This report describes a single case report. CONCLUSION: Our new cement injection technique may allow balloon kyphoplasty to be safely and effectively performed in cancer patients with pathological vertebral compression fractures, even if there are large defects in the anterior vertebral wall and neurological deficits.",eng,0.0

However, long term follow-up data in cases of pathologic fractures are lacking. The authors report follow-up results of VP in 185 pathologic fractures of 102 spinal tumor patients. METHODS: Percutaneous VP was performed at 185 vertebral bodies of 102 patients from 2001 to 2007. Retrospective analysis was done with medical records and radiological data. The change of visual analogue score (VAS), vertebral body (VB) height and kyphotic angle were measured preoperatively and on postoperative one day and at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: The patients were composed of metastatic spine tumors (81%) and multiple myeloma (19%). Involved spinal segments were between T6 and L5. Mean follow-up period was 12.2 months. VAS for back pain was 8.24 preoperatively, 3.59 (postoperative one day), 4.08 (three months) and 5.22 (one year). VB compression ratio changed from 21.33% preoperatively to 13.82% (postoperative one day), 14.36% (three month), and 16.04% (one year). Kyphotic angle changed from 15.35 degrees preoperatively to 12.03 degrees (postoperative one day), 13.64 degrees (three month), and 15.61 degrees (one year). CONCLUSION: Immediate pain relief was definite after VP in pathologic compression fracture of osteolytic spinal disease. Although VAS was slightly increased on one year follow-up, VP effect was maintained without significant change.

An,2002.0,Biomechanical evaluation of an injectable calcium phosphate cement for vertebroplasty,", ","STUDY DESIGN: Destructive biomechanical tests using fresh cadaveric thoracolumbar vertebral bodies. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the compression strength of human vertebral bodies injected with a new calcium phosphate (CaP) cement with improved infiltration properties for augmentation of the vertebral bodies before compression fracture and also for vertebroplasty in comparison with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) injection. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is the percutaneous injection of PMMA cement into the vertebral body. While PMMA has high mechanical strength, it cures fast and thus allows only a short handling time. Other potential problems of using PMMA injection may include damage to surrounding tissues by a high polymerization temperature or by the unreacted toxic monomer, and the lack of long-term biocompatibility. Bone mineral cements, such as calcium carbonate and CaP cements, have longer working time and low thermal effect. They are also biodegradable while having a good mechanical strength. However, the viscosity of injectable mineral cements is high, and the infiltration of these cements into vertebral body has been questioned. Recently, the infiltration properties of a CaP cement have been significantly improved, which is ideal for the transpedicular injection to the vertebral bodies for vertebroplasty or augmentation of osteoporotic vertebral body strength. METHODS: The bone mineral densities of 30 vertebral bodies (T2-L1) were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Ten control specimens were compressed at a loading rate of 15 mm/min to 50% of their original height. The other specimens had 6 mL of PMMA (n = 10) or the new CaP (n = 10) cement injected through the bilateral pedicle approach before being loaded in compression. Additionally, after the control specimens had been compressed, they were injected with either CaP (n = 5) or PMMA (n = 5) cement using the same technique, to simulate vertebroplasty. Loading experiments were repeated with the displacement control of 50% vertebral height. Load to failure was compared among groups and analyzed using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Mean bone mineral densities of all five groups were similar and ranged from 0.56 to 0.89 g/cm2. The size of the vertebral body and the amount of cement injected were similar in all groups. Load to failure values for PMMA, the new CaP, and vertebroplasty PMMA were significantly greater than that of control. Load to failure of the vertebroplasty CaP group was higher than control but not statistically significant. The mean stiffness of the vertebroplasty CaP group was significantly smaller than control, PMMA, and the new CaP groups. The mean height gains after injection of the new CaP and PMMA cements for vertebroplasty were minimal (3.56% and 2.01%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Results of this study demonstrated that the new CaP cement can be injected and infiltrates easily into the vertebral body. It was also found that injection of the new CaP cement can improve the strength of a fractured vertebral body to at least the level of its intact strength. Thus, the new CaP cement may be a good alternative to PMMA cement for vertebroplasty, although further in vivo animal and clinical studies should be done. Furthermore, the new CaP may be more effective in augmenting the strength of osteoporotic vertebral bodies for preventing compression fractures considering our biomechanical testing data and the known potential for biodegradability of the new CaP cement.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 208 patients (266 treated vertebral bodies) who were treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty from September 2002 to May 2006, 23 patients (41 treated levels) with residual or recurrent pain underwent follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Retrospective chart review with analysis of preoperative and postoperative MRIs were performed in these 23 patients. RESULTS: In the 41 treated vertebral bodies, 22 of 41 bodies had vacuum cleft found in the preoperative MRI study. Eight of the 22 treated vertebral bodies with preoperative vacuum clefts were found to have fluid between the interface of cement and the residual bone in the collapsed vertebral bodies on follow-up MRI. The adjacent discs of these treated vertebral bodies were upward/downward displaced. The endplate of the adjacent vertebral body exhibited fibrotic change. Treated bodies with vacuum clefts and level A location (T9, T11, T12, and L1) had higher probability of developing nonunion of the cement with statistical significance. The probability of nonunion cement in severe collapsed bodies might be higher than that of union cement in mild collapsed ones, but was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Fluid sign in the treated body represents unhealed bone-cement interface. The location of the treated vertebral body and existence of vacuum cleft in the treated bodies may be important factors influencing the nonunion of cement.",eng,1.0

Although vertebroplasty is widely utilized in patients when conservative treatment fails, we introduced an alternative percutaneous technique for the treatment of thoracic compression pain. METHODS: This in a retrospective study. The analysis was performed on 28 consecutive patients who underwent undergoing percutaneous dorsal root ganglion lysis with phenol for the treatment of pain associated with thoracic compression fracture. An acceptable treatment outcome was operationally defined as a pain intensity numerical rating scale (NRS) score of 3 or lower or EQ-5D index of 0.672 or higher. The primary outcome was pain relief and acceptable treatment outcome at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year. RESULTS: Of the 28 cases treated with our procedures, the change in mean NRS score between baseline and one day was -2.5 (95 % CI -1.6 ~ -3.4, p < 0.001), between baseline and one week was -4.7 (-4.1 to -5.3, p < 0.001), between baseline and one month was -5.8 (-5.2 to -6.5, p < 0.001), and between baseline and one year was -6.3 (-5.6 to -7.1, p < 0.001).

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Complications of the bone cement used in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures have received increasingly more attention, especially for bone cement volume. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess the relationship between bone cement volume fraction and adjacent vertebral fracture (AVF) after unilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2011, 495 patients with single level osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) were surgical treated by unilateral PKP and had completed 12-month follow-up in our hospital. According to the new OVCF, they were divided into three groups: AVF group, non-AVF group and normal group (who were not new OVCF). Based on the value of the plain radiography, the cement volume fraction for the vertebral body was calculated, and cement leakage, bone mineral density (BMD), visual analog scale (VAS), and Cobb angle of preoperative and postoperative were analyzed. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 110 (22.2%) patients had new OVCF, and others were normal (n=385). 52 cases were AVF, and 58 were non-AVF. The cement volume fraction of AVF group, non-AVF group and normal group were 32.5%+/-5.5%, 27.3%+/-1.8%, and 27.1%+/-2.6%, respectively. The 95% confidence interval of volume fraction were (31.0, 34.1), (26.8, 27.7), and (26.9, 28.5), respectively. The AVF group showed higher cement volume fraction in three groups (P<0.05), and there were no significant difference between non-AVF and normal group (P>0.05). There were 19 (36.5%) patients with cement leakage in AVF group, 12 (20.7%) in non-AVF group, and 68 (17.7%) in normal group. The AVF group showed higher cement leakage (P<0.05). Compared with AVF group and normal group, non-AVF group had lower BMD in preoperation. All groups reported significantly improved VAS scores and Cobb angle on the day of surgery. However, there were no significant difference between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral PKP is an effective and safe procedure for patients with OVCF. However, cement volume should be determined in terms of the vertebral body fraction to obtain a favorable outcome. The risk of AVF and cement leakage will increase obviously with the cement volume fraction increased. We recommend that a bone cement volume fraction of about one-fourth is suitable for unilateral PKP.",eng,0.0

Journal Article,E. P. Lin; S. Ekholm; A. Hiwatashi; P. L. Westesson,2004.0,Vertebroplasty: cement leakage into the disc increases the risk of new fracture of adjacent vertebral body,", ","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients successfully treated with vertebroplasty often return with new pain caused by a new vertebral body fracture. The new fractures often are adjacent to the vertebral bodies that were initially treated. In our clinical work, we have observed that cement leakage into the disk increases the risk of new fracture of the adjacent vertebral body. This study analyzed the risk of new fractures of adjacent vertebral bodies in relationship to cement leakage into the disk. METHODS: This study was based on 38 patients with painful compression fractures treated with vertebroplasty. Patients who returned with new pain after initial successful vertebroplasty were evaluated by repeat MR imaging. We analyzed the incidence of new fractures of adjacent vertebral bodies in relationship to cement leakage into the disk that had occurred during the initial vertebroplasty. RESULTS: Fourteen patients developed new fractures during the follow-up period. In 10 patients, the new fractures were associated with cement leakage into the disk, whereas four patients had new fractures that were not associated with cement leakage into the disk. This difference was statistically significant (P =.018). A detailed analysis showed that 58% of vertebral bodies adjacent to a disk with cement leakage fractured during the follow-up period compared with 12% of vertebral bodies adjacent to a disk without cement leakage (P <.0005). CONCLUSION: Leakage of cement into the disk during vertebroplasty increases the risk of a new fracture of adjacent vertebral bodies.",eng,0.0

METHODS: 29 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients were divided into two groups: 14 patients with recurrent fracture of a new vertebral body after vertebroplasty comprised the new fracture group and there were 15 patients without recurrent fracture in the control group. The following variables were reviewed: age, body mass index (BMI), history of fractures, history of metabolic disease, anti-osteoporosis therapy, type of back brace used, bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and hip, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), serum calcium and phosphorus, and time since vertebroplasty. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, patients in the new fracture group were statistically significantly different with respect to BMI (t = 2.538, P = 0.027), BMD of the lumbar spine (t = 2.761, P = 0.015), BMD of the hip (t = 2.367, P = 0.037) and iPTH (t = 2.711, P = 0.017). Twelve (86%) of the 14 patients' new vertebral fractures occurred within six months after treatment of the initial fracture, and 10 (71%) fractures were adjacent to those previously treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of patients with osteoporosis develop new fractures after vertebroplasty; two-thirds of these new fractures occur in vertebrae adjacent to those previously treated. The following variables influence the outcome: BMI, history of fractures, history of metabolic diseases and medications, BMD of lumbar spine and hip, anti-osteoporosis therapy, and use of back brace.",eng,1.0

METHODS: In this prospective randomized clinical study performed from January 2008 to December 2014, 68 patients scheduled for L5 percutaneous vertebroplasty were divided at random into group A, in which the traditional transpedicle approach was used, and group B, in which the computer-assisted lateral entry point approach was used. A visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index were evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively, and at the latest follow-up. RESULTS: Patient demographics were similar in the 2 groups. The mean duration of follow-up was 65 months. The mean distance between the entry point and the midline was 3.05 +/- 0.5 cm in group A and 7.04 +/- 0.7 cm in group B. The mean inclination angle measured on the preoperative axial image was 17.1 +/- 3.4 degrees in group A and 41 +/- 3.8 degrees in group B. Clinical outcomes were comparable in the 2 groups; however, cement leakage was significantly greater in group A (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the hemispherical morphology and convergent pedicle axis of the L5 vertebrae, a more lateral skin entry point and convergent angle of the puncture needle should be emphasized to reach the optimal point according to the preoperative assessment. The approach involving computer-assisted preoperative planning of the lateral entry point was associated with a higher rate of bilateral cement infiltration with fewer complications.",eng,0.0

In this study, we retrospectively evaluated and compared the findings between plain film, bone scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of new fracture in osteoporotic vertebral fractures. METHODS: This is a retrospective clinical study of patients who were diagnosed with osteoporotic vertebral fractures using plain film, bone scan, and MRI within a 1-month interval between February 2008 and December 2012. The findings in plain film, the extent of increased uptake in bone scan, and signal change in MRI were compared to evaluate the actual level of pain. All patients received percutaneous vertebroplasty according to MR finding. Pain scores (visual analog scale) of the study patients were compared prior to and after the procedure. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients with a mean age of 79.1 years (range 59-92 years) were enrolled in this study, and were treated by vertebroplasty confirmed by MRI. It was observed that patient pain score (visual analog scale) improved from 7.6 to 2.8. Plain film examination revealed 79 vertebrae that were suspected to be compression fractures. Among the suspected vertebrae, 62 showed increased uptake in bone scan, and MRI showed bony edema change in 58 vertebrae. The consistency between bone scan and MRI was 96.9% in patients with single-level suspected fracture on plain film. There was moderate agreement (kappa was 0.56) in patients where multiple levels were noted. Fifteen vertebrae with vacuum cleft sign on plain film showed total concordance in both bone scan and MRI. CONCLUSION: For patients with single-level compression fracture, the painful level in osteoporotic vertebral fractures can be determined by plain film and bone scan testing. Vacuum cleft sign noted on plain film may be enough to localize the level of pain. However, MRI testing is further needed in multiple osteoporotic vertebral fracture patients.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Men aged >/=50 years were apportioned to a group for men with fractures who had undergone percutaneous vertebroplasty (n=111), or a control group of healthy men (n=385). Fractures were verified on X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging. BMD T-scores were determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Diagnosis of osteoporosis was determined by a BMD T-score of </=2.5 standard deviations below the average for a young adult at peak bone density at the femoral neck, total hip, or L1-L4. Demographic and clinical risk factor data were self-reported through a questionnaire. BMD, OSTA, and FRAX scores were assessed for identifying PNOVFs via receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Optimal cutoff points, sensitivity, specificity, and areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) were determined. RESULTS: Between the men with fractures and the control group, there were significant differences in BMD T-scores (at femoral neck, total hip, and L1-L4), and OSTA and FRAX scores. In those with fractures, only 53.15% satisfied the criteria for osteoporosis. Compared to BMD or OSTA, the FRAX score had the best predictive value for PNOVFs: the AUC of the FRAX score (cutoff =2.9%) was 0.738, and the sensitivity and specificity were 82% and 62%, respectively. CONCLUSION: FRAX may be a valuable tool for identifying PNOVFs in older Chinese men.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,J. Lin; L. Zhang; H. L.

Balloon kyphoplasty (KP) has been proven to be efficacious for pain relief and reduction of vertebral height for patients with osteoporotic VCFs. However, very little is known about the comparison of clinical and radiographic outcomes between unilateral and bilateral balloon KP in treating this kind of patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and long-term radiographic and clinical outcomes of unilateral or bilateral balloon KP to treat patients with osteoporotic VCFs. STUDY DESIGN: A systemic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the analgesic efficacy, radiographic outcomes, and complications between unilateral and bilateral balloon KP in patients with osteoporotic VCFs. SETTING: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pubmed, CINAHL databases, Bandolier, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were systematically searched for evidence from their inception to July 2012 by 2 of the authors (J.L. and L.Z.). METHODS: Relevant reports were reviewed by 2 assessors independently and the reference lists of retrieved papers were scrutinized to identify further studies for inclusion, using guidelines set by PRISMA statement criteria. RESULTS: Three RCTs were enrolled in this study. The VAS scores showed no statistical difference between the groups before surgery and either at short-term or long-term follow-up. There was no statistical significance in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) leakage between the groups. Analysis of 2 studies showed statistical significance in surgery time (WMD -23.77 [-27.83, -19.71]; P < 0.00001) and PMMA (WMD -1.65 [-2.28, -1.02]; P < 0.00001) consumption between the groups. LIMITATIONS: There were few data sources from which to extract abstracted data or published studies. There were only 3 RCTs that met criteria enrollment in this meta-analysis. The quality of these trials was quite low (Jadad score: 1-2). Variable reporting of end points and inconsistent definitions meant that we were not able to include every study for each outcome. There was also clinical heterogeneity among the studies. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of both unilateral and bilateral balloon KP to provide rapid, significant, and sustained pain relief for patients with osteoporotic VCFs is validated. Unilateral balloon KP is a reasonable treatment for patients with osteoporotic VCFs considering that it could achieve equivalent pain relief with less surgery time and PMMA consumption compared to bilateral balloon KP. There was no evidence to prove that unilateral balloon KP results in higher incidence of PMMA leakage than bilateral balloon KP. Although unilateral balloon KP was less efficacious in the reduction of fractured vertebral body, it is still unclear if the clinical results of balloon KP were positively correlated with the restoration of vertebral height and amount.",eng,0.0

PURPOSE: To elucidate the benefits of an early VP intervention for aged patients with a PVCF by comparing the risks of mortality and respiratory-related morbidity. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective propensity score matched cohort. PATIENT SAMPLE: PVCF patients with an early VP and without an early VP intervention. OUTCOME MEASURES: Death, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. METHODS: A total of 10,785 PVCF patients who used analgesic injection during admission from 2000 through 2013 were selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. After matching, there were 1773 VP patients and 5324 non-VP patients included in this study. Conditional Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the risk of death and respiratory complications. RESULTS: The incidences of death at 1 year of VP and non-VP patients were 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-0.56) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.57-0.70) per 100 person-months, respectively. We observed a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.39 (95% CI: 1.09-1.78, p=.008) when comparing non-VP to VP patients. This phenomenon was seen when estimating the benefits of respiratory failure (HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.04-2.05, p=.028).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 75 patients with OVCFs who were aged >60 years and treated them through VP or kyphoplasty with IRD. The radiologic outcomes, namely the anterior and middle body heights (ABH and MBH, respectively) and kyphotic angle (KA), were measured preoperatively and at postoperative 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The refracture was identified on the basis of a decrease in ABH, MBH, or KA compared with those at postoperative 1 week. Visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and complications were recorded. The incidence of adjacent and nonadjacent fractures was also recorded. RESULTS: We treated 36 patients with kyphoplasty with IRD (IRD group) and 39 through VP (VP group). The patient characteristics were comparable in both groups. The KA and its restoration were more favorable after IRD than after VP. Although ABHs were not different in either group, their restoration was more efficient after IRD than after VP. MBHs, their restoration, and their refracture rates were better after IRD than after VP. VAS pain scores and complication rates were not different between the groups. The incidences of adjacent or nonadjacent fractures were not different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal significantly more efficient height restoration and kyphosis correction and fewer refractures in the IRD group. IRD may not increase the risk of adjacent or nonadjacent fractures.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To find the feasibility of using viscoplastic bone cement for vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty involved in bone cement reinforcement of fractured vertebra has shown promising clinical results. The most frequently observed complication of vertebroplasty is the cement leakage during surgery. Many methods were proposed and were successful at reducing the risk of leakage, such as creating a void within vertebra to reduce the injection pressure, increasing the cement viscosity to reduce the cement infiltration, etc. Nevertheless, a more cost-effective and safer surgery method is still the goal for many spine surgeons and researchers. METHODS: To deliver the viscoplastic bone cement into the vertebra, a unipedicular tract and a void in the vertebra was created using a curette. The viscoplastic bone cement was then delivered into the void piece by piece and tamped for compactness with a blunt end tool. For the in vitro biomechanical test, 7 thoracic vertebrae were used. The intact specimens were compressed to lose 25% of its intact height, and then augmented with viscoplastic bone cement. Postaugmentation CT scanning was taken to examine the cement distribution, leakage path, and cement filling ratio within the vertebra. Postaugmentation compression test was conducted to examine the vertebral strength and stiffness, and then compared with the intact ones. Finally, the vertebrae were cut into slices for micromorphologic analysis. RESULTS: The 6 in vivo clinical trials were all successfully operated with significant pain relief and showed no leakage during and after the surgery. The in vitro biomechanical test showed the cement augmentation significantly increased the vertebral strength (pre 3164 (229) N vs. post 3905 (484) N, P < 0.003), but tentatively decreased the vertebral stiffness (pre 1074 (74) N/mm vs. post 801 (370) N/mm, P = 0.081). The postaugmentation CT scanning showed the cement was well confined within the vertebra and the cement filling ratio was 21% (ranged from 15% to 29%). The depth that the viscoplastic bone cement infiltrated into the cancellous bone was 3.5 (0.6) mm, which is less than the depth [8.3 (2.2) mm, P < 0.001] of standard viscous bone cement vertebroplasty. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty using viscoplastic bone cement is clinically feasible and can effectively improve the vertebral strength and reduce the cement infiltration depth. The risk of cement leakage can also be decreased by using viscoplastic bone cement.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between intraosseous clefts and bone marrow perfusion using DCE-MRI in patients with osteoporotic VCF before vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The nonhealing cleft may be responsible for persistent pain and progressive vertebral collapse after acute injury. If localized kyphosis increased, there is risk of neuropathy appearing as a complication. Even after receiving vertebroplasty, it was reported to be at increased risk for subsequent cemented vertebral refracture and new adjacent vertebral fractures. DCE -MRI has been used for the evaluation of bone marrow perfusion. However, there are few reports on the evaluation of osteoporotic VCF and intraosseous cleft formation. MATERIALS: Forty subjects referred for evaluation of VCF underwent DCE-MRI. Bone marrow perfusion, as measured using the DCE-MRI time-intensity curve from a noninjured vertebrae was developed using two distinct parameters including peak enhancement ratio and enhancement slope. The ratio of the well-enhanced and the poorly enhanced zone of each injured vertebra were calculated. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between baseline clinical factors, parameters of DCE-MRI and presence or absence of intraosseous clefts. RESULTS: Twenty-nine injured vertebrae (72%) had intraosseous clefts. Lower PER of the noninjured vertebrae was associated with higher poorly enhanced zone ratio of the injured vertebrae (gamma = -0.362, P = 0.017). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified only lower PER (hazard ratio, 0.000; 95% confidence interval, 0.000-0.096; P = 0.009) was associated with the presence of intraosseous clefts. A peak enhancement ratio value less than 0.57 had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 90% for predicting intraosseous clefts. CONCLUSION: In patients with osteoporotic VCF before vertebroplasty, decreased bone marrow perfusion, as measured by DCE-MRI, was associated with intraosseous cleft formation.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors analyzed the occurrence of new VCFs in 70 patients who had previously undergone vertebroplasty for the treatment of one VCF. The following covariates were analyzed: age, sex, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), treated vertebral level, relative distance between treated vertebrae and new VCFs, pre-existing untreated VCFs, gas-containing vertebrae before treatment, and surgical approach. Surgical variables, including cement leakage into the disk, anterior vertebral height restoration, and kyphosis correction of treated vertebrae were also analyzed. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the relative risk of new adjacent VCFs. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate mean fracture-free rate over time. RESULTS: Seventy patients were reviewed, with a mean follow-up of 20.0 months +/- 10.2 (range, 6-48 months). We identified 22 new fractures in 19 of the 70 patients (27%), with 16 adjacent and six nonadjacent VCFs. The mean time to new fracture was 10.6 months +/- 9.5, and there was no significant difference in time to adjacent or nonadjacent VCF. Increased risk of VCF was associated with proximity to the treated vertebra, greater kyphosis correction, and low patient BMI. The 1-year fracture-free rate was 79.5%. CONCLUSIONS: New VCFs are common in patients with a low BMI, which suggests osteoporosis as a mechanism of fracture.",eng,1.0

However, refracture of cemented vertebrae occurs occasionally after vertebroplasty. It is unclear whether such fractures are procedure-related or part of the natural course of osteoporosis. The effect of potentially important covariates on refracture risk in cemented vertebrae has not been evaluated previously. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence and possible causative mechanism of refracture in patients who had received only one vertebroplasty for a single level of vertebral compression fracture. We assessed the following covariates: age, sex, body weight, height, lumbar spine bone mineral density, treated vertebral level, pre-existing untreated vertebral compression fracture, and gas-containing vertebrae before treatment. Surgical variables, including surgical approach, cement injected, and anterior vertebral height restoration, were also analyzed. Anti-osteoporotic treatment after surgery was recorded. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relative risk of refractures of cemented vertebrae. Over all, 98 patients were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 26.9 +/- 12.4 months (range, 7-55 months). We identified 62 refractures and the mean loss of anterior vertebral height was 13.3% (range 3.2-40.3%). The greater the anterior vertebral height obtained from vertebroplasty, the greater the risk of refracture occurring (P < 0.01). Gas-containing vertebrae were also prone to refracture after the procedure (P = 0.01). Anti-osteoporotic treatment was of borderline significance between refractured and non-refractured vertebrae (P = 0.07). Only restoration of anterior vertebral height was positively associated with refracture during the follow-ups (P < 0.01). In conclusion, refractures of cemented vertebrae after vertebroplasty occurred in 63% of osteoporotic patients. Significant anterior vertebral height restoration increases the risk of subsequent fracture in cemented vertebrae.",eng,1.0

The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate pre-procedural magnetic resonance images (MRI) for the prediction of further collapse and vertebral height loss after vertebroplasty. This study included 81 consecutive patients (73 women and 8 men) with osteoporotic compression fractures. MR studies were performed 1-5 days before vertebroplasty. Patients were followed to evaluate refracture for a minimum of 6 months after treatment. Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate relationships between clinical data, covariates on pre-procedural MRI, and the presence of cemented vertebrae refracture. The mean refracture rate was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. After a mean follow-up of 23.0 +/- 8.2 months, 46 cemented vertebrae (57%) experienced refracture, and the mean loss of anterior vertebral height was 11.3%. The 1-year refracture rate after vertebroplasty was 7%, and rapid increased to 76% in the third year. Cox proportional analysis showed that any 1% decrease in signal intensity on T2-weighted images of the injured vertebra will increase the refracture rate by 0.74% (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.81, p = 0.02), and a 1% increase in the poorly enhanced volume ratio will increase the refracture rate by 4.3% (OR = 5.32, 95% CI 1.22-23.14, p = 0.03).

Radiologists diagnose fragility fractures with all imaging modalities, which includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating radiologically occult insufficiency fractures, but also lateral chest radiographs showing asymptomatic vertebral fractures. In particular MRI fragility fractures may have a nonspecific appearance and the radiologists needs to be familiar with the typical locations and findings, to differentiate these fractures from neoplastic lesions. It should be noted that radiologists do not simply need to diagnose fractures related to osteoporosis but also to diagnose those fractures which are complications of osteoporosis related pharmacotherapy. In addition to using standard radiological techniques radiologists also use dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to quantitatively assess bone mineral density for diagnosing osteoporosis or osteopenia as well as to monitor therapy. DXA measurements of the femoral neck are also used to calculate osteoporotic fracture risk based on the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score, which is universally available. Some of the new technologies such as high-resolution peripheral computed tomography (HR-pQCT) and MR spectroscopy allow assessment of bone architecture and bone marrow composition to characterize fracture risk. Finally radiologists are also involved in the therapy of osteoporotic fractures by using vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and sacroplasty.

The flow and distribution of silicone oil were analyzed using Fluent software. In vertebral body, silicone oil formed a circle-like shape centered by injection point on transverse and longitudinal sections, finally forming a sphere-like shape as a whole. Silicone oil diffused along lateral and posterior walls forming a circle-like shape on transverse section centered by injection point in pedicle, eventually forming a sphere-like shape as a whole. This study demonstrated that silicone oil flowed and diffused into a circle-like shape centered by injection point and finally formed a sphere-like shape as a whole in both vertebral body and pedicle.

Jiang,2013.0,Comparing pain reduction following vertebroplasty and conservative treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,", ","BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) are the most common osteoporotic fractures. Pain is the main symptom. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a therapeutic procedure performed to reduce pain in vertebral compression fractures. Numerous case series and several small, non-blinded, non-randomized controlled studies have suggested that vertebroplasty is an effective means of relieving pain from osteoporotic fractures. However, a recent pooled analysis from 2 multicenter randomized controlled trials concluded that the improvement in pain afforded by PVP was similar to placebo. OBJECTIVE: To compare the amount of pain reduction measured using the visual analog scale when OVCF is treated with vertebroplasty or conservatively, and assess the clinical utility of PVP. DESIGN: A meta-analysis and systematic review of randomized controlled trials was performed comparing pain reduction following vertebroplasty and conservative treatment. LIMITATIONS: There were few data sources from which to extract abstracted data or published studies. There were only 5 randomized controlled trials that met our criteria. The conservative treatments used as comparators in these trials were different. METHODS: A search of MEDLINE from January 1980 to July 2012 using PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and EMBASE. Relevant reports were examined by 2 independent reviewers and the references from these reports were searched for additional trials, using the criteria established in the QUOROM statement. RESULTS: Pooled results from 5 randomized controlled trials are shown. There was no difference in pain relief in the PVP group at 2 weeks and one month when compared with the conservatively managed group. Pain relief in the PVP group was greater than that of the conservative group at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. However, after subgroup analysis, pain scores were similar between the PVP group and the sham injection group from 2 weeks to 6 months. Compared with non-operative therapy, PVP reduced pain at all times studied. CONCLUSION: PVP has some value for relieving pain; however, the possibility of a placebo effect should be considered. PVP has gained acceptance as a complementary treatment when conservative management has failed before its benefits have been fully understood. More large scale, double blinded, controlled trials are necessary in order to quantify the pain relief afforded by PVP more precisely.",eng,0.0

METHODS: From May 2006 to July 2007, percutaneous unilateral kyphoplasty with single balloon was performed in 7 vertebras of 6 SVCF patients, with 2 injured vertebras in 2 males and 5 in 4 females, who were from 64 to 83 years old. The injured vertebras included 1 in T5, 2 in T8, 3 in T10 and 1 in T12 and the compression rates were 60% to 75% in 5 vertebras and > 75% in 2 vertebras. All the injured vertebras were old fractures and caused severe back pain, but without any neurotic symptoms and signs. The visual analogue scale (VAS) ranged from 6.5 to 9.0, 7.7 on average. The posterior vertebral walls were all intact in all patients under CT scan. The balloon was inset into the vertebra through pedicle of vertebral arch by percutaneous puncture under the guidance of C-type arm X-ray unit. The balloon was then extended to restore the vertebral body which was filled with bone cement later. The average volume of cement required was 3.5 mL (2.6 to 4.4 mL). RESULTS: The pain was alleviated or completely relieved after the operation. The mean vertebral body height restoration was 9.7% +/- 1.4% on the anterior border. Two cement leakages were found on X-ray. One month after the treatment, the VAS was from 0 to 2.45, 1.32 on average, and there was significant difference compared with preoperation (P < 0.05). Three months after the treatment, the VAS was from 0 to 3, 2.13 on average, and there was no significant difference compared with 1 month after the treatment (P > 0.05).

Liao,2015.0,Long-term follow-up study of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture treated using balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty,10.3171/2014.11.spine14579,"OBJECT: Long-term follow-up study is required for verifying whether the clinical outcomes of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are altered. The authors' findings showed only subtle differences between these operations within a 5-year period. However, they still suggest the use of vertebroplasty over kyphoplasty in view of the treatment costs. In their previous study, the authors performed a short-term prospective comparison between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Vertebroplasty was recommended instead of kyphoplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) because of the subtle differences between this procedure and kyphoplasty and the treatment costs. To determine whether these clinical outcomes persist in the long term, they continued to observe the patients from their short-term study over a longer-term period. METHODS :One hundred cases of VCF were assigned randomly to either the kyphoplasty or the vertebroplasty group. In cement augmentation, the authors used polymethylmethacrylate as bone filler. Pain was assessed by using a visual analog scale (VAS). For each patient, vertebral body height and wedge angle were measured from reconstructed CT images. RESULTS: The duration of the follow-up period was 5 years. Vertebral body height, kyphotic wedge angle, and VAS score were not evidently altered. Eight patients in the kyphoplasty group had an adjacent fracture after the procedure, whereas 7 patients in the vertebroplasty group had an adjacent fracture after the procedure. These adjacent fractures occurred within 1 year of surgery in both treatment groups except in 1 kyphoplasty-treated patient in whom the adjacent fracture was noted 16 months after treatment. Three patients in the vertebroplasty group had a nonadjacent fracture, and 4 patients in the kyphoplasty group had a nonadjacent fracture. The link between angular correction and the occurrence of adjacent fracture was statistically significant in the vertebroplasty group. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive angular correction is a critical concern in the risk of adjacent fracture after vertebroplasty. Given the subtle differences between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty observed over the course of 5 years, vertebroplasty remains the preferred option in view of the costs.",eng,0.0

METHODS: From May 2004 to March 2009, among 29 patients (32 vertebras) with thoracolumbar fractures, 18 patients (21 vertebras) were treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and 11 patients (11 vertebras) were treated with percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). The visual analogue scale (VAS) and mobility were evaluated 3 days before and after operation. During follow-up period, patients were observed and evaluated in terms of relief of back pain and regaining of living ability. Complications such as bone cement leakage were analyzed. RESULTS: All the patients got successful operation. The average operation time was 38.6 minutes for the 18 patients (21 vertebras) with PVP performed, and 3.2 ml (2-5 ml) bone cement was injected. For the 11 patients (11 vertebras) with PKP performed, the average operation time was 43 minutes, and an average of 3.8 ml (2-6 ml) bone cement was injected. The VAS decreased from preoperative (7.5 +/- 0.7) to (2.2 +/- 0.5) at the 3rd day after operation; the mobility scores of the patients decreased from preoperative (2.4 +/- 0.6) to (1.2 +/- 0.3) at the 3rd day after operation; the vertebral height increased from an average of (52.4 +/- 9.7)% pre-operation to (85.2 +/- 10.6)% after operation; and the average kyphosis correction of Cobb angle was 11.2 degrees. During an average of 12.6 months follow-up, no patients reported vertebral pain. Review of X-ray films showed no significant loss of vertebral height. One patient died from complications of heart disease 5 months being discharged from hospital. Another patient died from the same cause at 6 months after opertaion. Paravertebral leakage of bone cement was also found in 2 patients. No serious complications occurred and patients were satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSION: PVP, PKP can be used to instantly reinforce vertebral injury, relieve pain, and improve the patient's mobility. For elder people with fresh thoracolumbar fractures, when health conditions are allowed, PVP or PKP surgery is the right treatment.",chi,0.0

Preoperative x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, and 3-dimensional reconstructions were studied. During the PKP procedure, needle was carefully put to avoid too near to the cortical defect according to CT image. High-viscosity bone cement was used via unilateral PKP. Radiographic outcomes were evaluated by assessment of vertebral body wall breakage, fracture type, and vertebral body change. The exact rate of CL was analyzed.A total of 77 patients with single-level OVCF were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 74.8 +/- 8.0 years. Among these cases, 7 (9.1%) involved the thoracic spine (T3-T10), 60 (77.9%) involved the thoracolumbar spine (T10-L2), and 10 (13.0%) involved the lumbar spine (L3-L5). There were 27 vertebral bodies found posterior wall breakage, 51 vertebral bodies found endplate breakage, and 49 vertebral bodies found anterior-lateral wall breakage. CT scan was more efficient in detecting vertebral body wall breakage and CL than x-ray (P < .001). No neurological symptoms were found after surgery. Both cases with CL (CL group) and cases without cement leakage (NCL group) experienced vertebral height restoration (HR) with similar cement volume CV. There were no significant difference between the two groups about the parameter HR and CV. Severe vertebral body fracture and biconcave fracture had more CL than other groups. OVCF cases with cortical defect had more CL rate than those without cortical defect; however, no significant difference was found in the correlation between vertebral wall breakage and CL.Cortical defect remains a potential risk of CL during PKP surgery. Careful preoperative evaluation and using high-viscosity bone cement during the unilateral PKP procedure could prevent serious leakage and clinical symptoms.",eng,0.0

New fractures and secondary adverse effects were also analyzed during a mid-long term follow-up period. METHODS: Patients were recruited to this prospective nonrandomized trial from a single hospital. Patients were aged 55 years or older, had vertebral compression fractures on spine radiograph (level of fracture at T6 or lower; bone oedema on MRI), with back pain for 6 weeks or less, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 6 or more. Patients were nonrandomly assigned to PVP group or conservative treatment group according to their own desire. After 2 weeks, patients from the conservative group could change therapy to PVP. VAS for pain and Oswestry disability index (ODI) questionnaire scores were assessed before and 1 week, 1 month, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after the treatment. Other data included patients' baseline characteristics before the treatment, new fractures and secondary adverse effects were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 181 consecutive patients were nonrandomly allocated to receive PVP (n=103) or conservative treatment (n=78) between December 2009 and August 2013. Six patients transferred to PVP group after 2 weeks conservative therapy. Pain relief and functional outcomes were significantly better in PVP group than in conservative group, as determined by VAS scores (3.67-1.13 vs 7.38-2.39) and ODI scores (23.55-5.83 vs 36.10-13.88) at 1 week, 1 month, 3 and 6 months (all P< 0.01). Both VAS and ODI scores decreased in PVP group showed no statistical significance at 1 year when compared with conservative group (P>0.05). However, pain relief and functional outcomes were significantly better at most of the subsequent follow-up points. The patients with complete pain relief (VAS<1) were significantly better in PVP group than in conservative group (P< 0.01) at all of the follow-up points. There were 17 patients died (PVP group: n=8) and 31 cases occurred secondary vertebral fractures (PVP group: n=19) during the follow-up periods. No serious complications or adverse events were related to PVP technique. CONCLUSION: PVP has immediate pain relief and functional improvement compared with conservative treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 132 consecutive patients with osteoporosis treated with PV in a single institution over 46 months from March 2005 to December 2008. Multivariable logistic regression and univariate analysis were employed to identify risk factors for new VCFs after PV, including patient demographic data, parameters of the initial and new fractured vertebrae, procedure-related information, and follow-up data. RESULTS: During the follow-up period (22.4 months +/- 12.1), 80 new vertebral fractures occurred in 36 (27.3%) patients. Multivariate analysis showed that number of VCFs per time frame, computed tomography (CT) value of nonfractured vertebrae (T11-L2), activity level after discharge, duration of follow-up, and cement distribution in the inferior part of the vertebral body or close to the endplate were statistically correlated with new fractures (odds ratios, 2.63, 0.96, 3.59, 1.00, 0.30, and 0.05; P = .006, P = .001, P = .007, P = .004, P = .021 and P = .029). Univariate analysis showed preexisting old VCFs were correlated with new VCFs (P = .045). Subsequent compression fractures in adjacent vertebrae (45 of 80) occurred more frequently and sooner than nonadjacent vertebral fractures (both P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of new VCFs after PV is relatively high and affected by several risk factors that are related to both the PV procedure and the natural course of osteoporosis.",eng,1.0

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to review 31 consecutive patients with symptomatic VHs that underwent vertebroplasty procedures (13 males, 18 females; mean age, 57.5 years), for a total of 33 affected vertebral levels (range, T4-L5 levels). Pre procedure radiological examinations were reviewed. The presence of predominant soft tissue stroma on CT, low signals on T1W of MRI, epidural tissue, and cortical erosion are considered features of aggressiveness. The clinical effects were evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) at the pre and each postoperative follow-up time point (mean follow-up of 15.8 months). RESULTS: Symptomatic VHs with no signs of aggressiveness were observed in 26 lesions and those with signs of aggressiveness in 7 lesions. Vertebroplasty was successfully performed under fluoroscopic guidance with a unipedicular approach in 16 levels, a bipedicular approach in 17 levels.

In 27 follow-up cases, there were 9 males and 18 females with an average age of 75 years (range, 58-90 years) and with an average disease duration of 9.8 months (range, 2-17 months). One vertebral body was involved in 26 cases and 2 vertebral bodies were involved in 1 case. According to the imaging examination and Krauss et al. criterion, all patients were diagnosed as having vertebral vacuum phenomenon. Refer to the lateral X-ray views, the height and the kyphotic angle of the involved vertebral body were measured pre- and postoperatively. The surgical outcomes were evaluated by using visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) system. RESULTS: All operations were performed successfully with no severe complication. The mean follow-up of 27 patients was 32 months (range, 24-58 months). The mean clinical healing time of OVCF was 4 months (range, 3-6 months).

We propose graphical displays that help formalize and visualize the results of sensitivity analyses, building upon the idea of 'tipping-point' analysis for randomized experiments with a binary outcome and a dichotomous treatment. The resulting 'enhanced tipping-point displays' are convenient summaries of conclusions obtained from making different modeling assumptions about missingness mechanisms. The primary goal of the displays is to make formal sensitivity analysesmore comprehensible to practitioners, thereby helping them assess the robustness of the experiment's conclusions to plausible missingness mechanisms.

Our hypothesis is that thoracolumbar vertebrae adjacent to a vertebroplasty site have a higher incidence of new compression fracture than do other vertebrae. METHODS: Between March 2001 and December 2002, a total of 271 patients underwent vertebroplasty and a retrospective review of charts was performed. Patients reached 24 months of follow-up were included for analyses. Age, gender, bone mineral density, the numbers of prior vertebroplasty procedures, cement volume, postoperative kyphotic angle, the vertebral level, and kyphotic changes were assessed in relation to surgical outcome. RESULTS: The 220 patients had a mean age of 72.7 years (range, 53-97 years) and a mean follow-up interval of 25.6 months (range, 24-36 months). A total of 15 patients had 18 new fractures, and 11 new fractures were at the thoracolumbar junction (T12-L1) (p = 0.61). New fractures were in vertebrae adjacent to a treated vertebra in 55.6% (10 of 18 cases) of cases. Analysis of potential predictors for new vertebral fracture failed to identify statistically significant risk factors, despite a large sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 6.16% (18 of 292) of all treated vertebra developed associated new vertebral fractures. Cranial vertebrae were most likely to fracture at the adjacent level, whereas thoracic vertebrae were least likely to fracture at the adjacent level. Additional risk factors for new vertebral fracture are poorly understood.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Clinical and radiographic results of 1-segmental pedicle screw fixation combined with vertebroplasty (Group A, n equal to 12) or posterior shortening osteotomy (Group B, n equal to 16) for osteoporotic thoracolumbar Kvmmell's disease were analyzed retrospectively. Japanese orthopedic association (JOA) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were used for clinical evaluation. Neurological status was judged by Frankel grades. X-ray was used to evaluate the radiographic results. Complications related to operation and devices were also considered. RESULTS: The follow-up period was 12-54 months (average 29 months). Pre-and post-operative VAS were 9.3 and 3.2 in Group A, 8.9 and 2.5 in Group B, respectively. The mean JOA score at the final follow-up was significantly higher than that of pre-operation (t equal to 5.306, P less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between Groups A and B (t equal to 0.618, P larger than 0.05). The kyphosis were corrected from preoperative 33.9 degree A)/37.3 degree B) to postoperative 10.3 degree A)/6.5 degree B), and 15.3 degree (A)/13.7 degree B) at the final follow-up. There was a significant difference between the two groups at the final follow-up. Frankel grade was improved from grade C preoperatively to postoperatively grade D or E in 7 cases of Group A and 5 cases of Group B, from grade D to E in 5 cases of Group A and 11 cases of Group B. The mean improvement was 1.6 and 1.7 grades for Groups A and B, respectively. There were no serious complications related to internal fixation.

The major problem encountered when trying to perform a meta-analysis of the available studies for the use of cementoplasty in patients with a VCF is that conservative management has not been standardised. Forms of conservative treatment commonly used in these patients include bed rest, analgesic medication, physiotherapy and bracing. In this review, we report the best evidence available on the conservative care of patients with osteoporotic VCFs and associated back pain, focusing on the role of the most commonly used spinal orthoses. Although orthoses are used for the management of these patients, to date, there has been only one randomised controlled trial published evaluating their value.

Two additional properties obtained from the viscosity-versus-time curves, namely the time at the onset of curing, and the critical curing rate were also studied. Significant interactive effects between the amount of crosslinker and the amount of radical initiator were found to affect the doughing time and the critical curing rate.

OBJECTIVE: To draw attention to the possible adverse skeletal events in breast cancer patients, and the need of a watchful staff within the multidisciplinary team in charge. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Breast cancer is a rare condition in men, the male/female ratio is 1 of 100 approximately; in both sexes bone metastases are the most common. The pathologic fracture by spinal metastases can cause intense pain with difficult management. Vertebroplasty has been used successfully to treat pain and improve functional status in patients with vertebral compression fractures due to metastases. METHODS: A 43-year-old male patient was diagnosed of having breast epithelial carcinoma after histologic analysis of a femur fracture. Following reconstruction, the patient started rehabilitative treatment. In a control visit, he referred sudden cervical pain which was initially treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and rest. The patient was seen in a later visit and complained about poor response to analgesia. For this reason, a radiologic study was carried out, showing signs of fracture of the third cervical vertebral body (C3), and was completed with magnetic resonance imaging where the diagnosis of osteolytic metastasis was confirmed. RESULTS: After consulting the interventionist radiology team, vertebroplasty was carried out aiming to diminishing the pain. There were no postoperative complications and the patient's recovery from cervicalgia permitted the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suspension. Two weeks after the vertebroplasty, the patient resumed his rehabilitative treatment without presenting cervical pain or mobility limitation. CONCLUSION: Spinal metastases treatment may include combinations of radiotherapy, vertebroplasty, and bisphosphonates, which have proved analgesic effect and a decrease of bone complications; however, out of these options, only vertebroplasty allows rapid stabilization and analgesia.",eng,0.0

After 1 month of conservative treatment for VCFs, patients with intractable pain were offered treatment with KP or VP according to a treatment algorithm that considers time from fracture (Delta t) and amount of vertebral body collapse. Bone biopsy was obtained intra-operatively to exclude patients affected by malignancy or osteomalacia. 164 patients were included according to the above criteria. Mean age was 67.6 years. Mean follow-up was 33 months. 10 patients (6.1%) were lost to follow-up and 154 reached the minimum 2-year follow-up. 118 (69.5%) underwent VP and 36 (30.5%) underwent KP. Complications affected five patients treated with VP, whose one suffered a transient intercostal neuropathy and four a subsequent VCF (two at adjacent level). Results in terms of visual analogue scale and Oswestry scores were not different among treatment groups.

The stiffness and fracture load were measured in both groups. RESULTS: After PKP, the stiffness was (571.513 +/- 83.373)N/mm and the fracture load was (1751.659 +/- 112.291)N in group A, with both significantly higher than those of group B (stiffness, (307.706 +/- 46.723)N/mm; fracture load, (1128.011 +/- 125.417)N). CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the risk of upper adjacent vertebral fracture, it is better to restore the height of injured vertebral body and decrease the angle of kyphosis to increase the capability of upper adjacent vertebral body against fracture.",eng,0.0

DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. BACKGROUND: A major concern after percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients with osteoporosis is the occurrence of subsequent vertebral compression fractures in the untreated vertebral bodies. The risk factors for the development of subsequent vertebral compression fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty are unclear. METHODS: Two hundred four consecutive patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty for acute vertebral compression fractures between January 2007 and December 2008. Forty-nine patients were excluded. Subsequent vertebral compression fractures were diagnosed by bone edema changes on magnetic resonance imaging. Patient's demographic data were used for univariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Forty-three (27.7%) of the 155 patients had subsequent vertebral compression fractures within 2 years of percutaneous vertebroplasty, with 21 (48.8%) of these patients having fractures detected within 3 months. Adjacent vertebral compression fractures tended to occur sooner, although not significantly (log-rank test, P = 0.112). On multivariate analyses, only the T-score of bone mineral density was significantly associated with subsequent vertebral compression fractures (P < 0.0001; odds ratio = 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.49). CONCLUSIONS: The only risk factor significantly associated with subsequent vertebral compression fractures following percutaneous vertebroplasty was a low bone mineral density T-score. Patients with lower bone mineral density have a higher incidence of vertebral compression fractures and thus need more intensive clinical and radiological follow-up.",eng,1.0

This review summarizes recent findings on outcome, complications and their impact on anesthetic management. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite an increasing number of publications on surgical technique, therapeutic efficacy and side effects of these interventions, anesthetic management per se is hardly investigated. All three treatments provide similar pain relief. Adverse effects include local cement leakage and new fractures adjacent to augmented vertebrae. Asymptomatic pulmonary cement embolism occurs in 4.6-6.8% of patients depending on cement viscosity, injection pressure and number of injected vertebrae. Potentially life-threatening embolism of cement or fat may occur. Kyphoplasty and lordoplasty aim at correcting vertebral deformity and are equally effective; lordoplasty is substantially less expensive, however. The incidence of systemic cement or fat embolism is similar to that in vertebroplasty. Whereas vertebroplasty is mostly performed under local anesthesia and sedation, general anesthesia is required for kyphoplasty and lordoplasty. The anesthetic regimen follows the principles of anesthesia in the elderly population. SUMMARY: Vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty and lordoplasty are effective minimally invasive treatments for stable vertebral compression fractures without compression of the spinal canal. The anesthesiologist must be prepared to manage systemic cement or fat embolism.",eng,0.0

It has the potential to restore vertebral shape and reduce spinal deformity, but the actual clinical and mechanical benefits of kyphoplasty remain unclear. In a cadaveric study, we compare the ability of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty to restore spine mechanical function, and vertebral body shape, following vertebral fracture. METHODS: Fifteen pairs of thoracolumbar motion segments"" (two vertebrae with the intervening disc and ligaments) were obtained from cadavers aged 42-96 years. All specimens were compressed to induce vertebral body fracture. Then one of each pair underwent vertebroplasty and the other kyphoplasty, using 7 ml of polymethylmethacrylate cement. Augmented specimens were compressed for 2 hours to allow consolidation. At each stage of the experiment, motion segment stiffness was measured in bending and compression, and the distribution of loading on the vertebrae was determined by pulling a miniature pressure transducer through the intervertebral disc. Disc pressure measurements were performed in flexed and extended postures with a compressive load of 1.0-1.5 kN. They revealed the intradiscal pressure (IDP) which acts on the central vertebral body, and they enabled compressive load-bearing by the neural arch (F(N)) to be calculated. Changes in vertebral height and wedge angle were assessed from radiographs. The volume of leaked cement was determined by water displacement. Volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) of each vertebral body was calculated using DXA and water displacement. RESULTS: Vertebral fracture reduced motion segment compressive stiffness by 55%, and bending stiffness by 39%. IDP fell by 61-88%, depending on posture. F(N) increased from 15% to 36% in flexion and from 30% to 58% in extension (P<0.001). Fracture reduced vertebral height by an average 0.94 mm and increased vertebral wedging by 0.95 degrees (P<0.001). Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty were equally effective in partially restoring all aspects of mechanical function (including stiffness, IDP, and F(N)), but vertebral wedging was reduced only by kyphoplasty (P<0.05). Changes in mechanical function and vertebral wedging were largely maintained after consolidation, but height restoration was not. Cement leakage was similar for both treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty were equally effective at restoring mechanical function to an injured spine. Only kyphoplasty was able to reverse minor vertebral wedging.""",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVES.: To determine how the volume of injected cement influences: (a) stress distributions on fractured and adjacent vertebral bodies, (b) load-sharing between the vertebral bodies and neural arch, and (c) cement leakage. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Vertebroplasty is increasingly used to treat vertebral fractures, but there are problems concerning adjacent level fracture and cement leakage, both of which may depend on the volume of injected cement. METHODS.: Nineteen thoracolumbar motion segments from 13 cadavers (42-91 years) were loaded to induce fracture. Fractured vertebrae received 2 sequential injections (VP1 and VP2) of 3.5 cm of polymethylmethacrylate cement. Before and after each intervention, motion segment stiffness was measured in compression and in bending, and stress profilometry"" was used to quantify the distribution of compressive stress in the intervertebral disc (which presses equally on fractured and adjacent vertebrae). Stress profiles were obtained by pulling a pressure transducer through the disc while the motion segment was compressed in flexed and extended postures. Stress profiles yielded the intradiscal pressure (IDP), the magnitude of stress peaks in the anterior and posterior (SPP) anulus, and the percentage of the applied compressive force resisted by the neural arch (FN). Cement leakage and vertebral body volume were quantified using water-immersion, and the percentage cement fill was estimated. RESULTS.: Bending and compressive stiffness fell by 37% and 50% respectively following fracture, and were restored only after VP2. Depending on posture, IDP fell by 59-85% after fracture whereas SPP increased by 107- 362%. VP1 restored IDP and SPP to prefracture values, and VP2 produced no further changes. Fracture increased FN from 11% to 39% in flexion, and from 33% to 59% in extension. FN was restored towards prefracture values only after VP2. Cement leakage increased after VP2 and was negatively correlated to vertebral body volume. Following VP2, increases in IDP and compressive stiffness were proportional to percentage fill. CONCLUSION.: About 3.5 cm of PMMA largely restored normal stress distributions to fractured and adjacent vertebral bodies, but 7 cm were required to restore motion segment stiffness and load-sharing between the vertebral bodies and neural arch. Cement leakage, IDP and compressive stiffness all increased with percentage fill.""",eng,1.0

Injecting cement into a damaged vertebral body (vertebroplasty) is known to help restore its shape and stiffness. We now hypothesise that vertebroplasty is also effective in reducing subsequent creep deformations. Twenty-eight spine specimens, comprising three complete vertebrae and the intervening discs, were obtained from cadavers aged 67-92 years. Each specimen was subjected to increasingly-severe compressive loading until one of its vertebrae was fractured, and the damaged vertebral body was then treated by vertebroplasty. Before and after fracture, and again after vertebroplasty, each specimen was subjected to a static compressive force of 1kN for 1h while elastic and creep deformations were measured in the anterior, middle and posterior regions of each adjacent vertebral body cortex, using a 2D MacReflex optical tracking system. After fracture, creep in the anterior and central regions of the vertebral body cortex increased from an average 4513 and 885 microstrains, respectively, to 54,107 and 34,378 microstrains (both increases: P<0.001). Elastic strains increased by a comparable amount. Vertebroplasty reduced creep in the anterior and central cortex by 61% (P=0.006) and 66% (P=0.017) respectively. Elastic strains were reduced by less than half this amount. Results suggest that the beneficial effects of vertebroplasty on the vertebral body continue long after the post-operative radiographs. Injected cement not only helps to restore vertebral shape and elastic properties, but also reduces subsequent creep deformation of the damaged vertebra.""",eng,1.0

Vertebroplasty"" is becoming popular but the procedure has yet to be optimised. This study compared the ability of two different types of cement to restore the spine's mechanical properties following fracture, and it examined how the mechanical efficacy of vertebroplasty depends on bone mineral density (BMD), fracture severity, and disc degeneration. METHODS: A pair of thoracolumbar ""motion-segments"" (two adjacent vertebrae with intervening soft tissue) was obtained from each of 15 cadavers, aged 51-91 years. Specimens were loaded to induce vertebral fracture; then one of each pair underwent vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement, the other with another composite material (Cortoss). Specimens were creep loaded for 2 h to allow consolidation. At each stage of the experiment, motion segment stiffness in bending and compression was measured, and the distribution of compressive loading on the vertebrae was investigated by pulling a miniature pressure transducer through the intervertebral disc. Pressure measurements, repeated in flexed and extended postures, indicated the intradiscal pressure (IDP) and neural arch compressive load-bearing (F(N)). BMD was measured using DXA. Fracture severity was quantified from height loss. RESULTS: Vertebral fracture reduced motion segment stiffness in bending and compression, by 31% and 43% respectively (p<0.001). IDP fell by 43-62%, depending on posture (p<0.001), whereas F(N) increased from 14% to 37% of the applied load in flexion, and from 39% to 61% in extension (p<0.001). Vertebroplasty partially reversed all these effects, and the restoration of load-sharing was usually sustained after creep-consolidation. No differences were observed between PMMA and Cortoss. Pooled results from 30 specimens showed that low BMD was associated with increased fracture severity (in terms of height loss) and with greater changes in stiffness and load-sharing following fracture. Specimens with low BMD and more severe fractures also showed the greatest mechanical changes following vertebroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Low vertebral BMD leads to greater changes in stiffness and spinal load-sharing following fracture. Restoration of mechanical function following vertebroplasty is little influenced by cement type but may be greater in people with low BMD who suffer more severe fractures.""",eng,1.0

In each of these treatments, a bone cement paste is injected into the fractured vertebral body/bodies, and the cement of choice is a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement. One drawback of this cement is the very high exothermic temperature, which, it has been suggested, causes thermal necrosis of surrounding tissue. In the present work, we prepared novel composite PMMA bone cement where microcapsules containing a phase change material (paraffin) (PCMc) were mixed with the powder of the cement. A PCM absorbs generated heat and, as such, its presence in the cement may lead to reduction in thermal necrosis. We determined a number of properties of the composite cement. Compared to the values for a control cement (a commercially available PMMA cement used in VP and BKP), each composite cement was found to have significantly lower maximum exothermic temperature, increased setting time, significantly lower compressive strength, significantly lower compressive modulus, comparable biocompatibility, and significantly smaller thermal necrosis zone. Composite cement containing 20% PCMc may be suitable for use in VP and BKP and thus deserves further evaluation.",English,0.0

We highlight a case of a 75-year-old female household ambulator who presented with significant thoracolumbar pain and delayed T12 collapse after a ground-level fall. The patient had sustained a trivial fall at home 4 months prior to this presentation and had been hospitalized in our institution at that time for a general medical workup. Dedicated spine radiographs were not obtained during this visit. However, lateral chest radiograph demonstrated an intact T12 vertebral body. The patient was able to mobilize successfully with therapy and was discharged home. During the interim between the initial fall and subsequent presentation, she resumed physical activity including ambulating independently and performing various housework. Approximately 4 months following her initial injury, the patient returned to a local emergency department with vague complaints of abdominal pain without any history of recent fall or injury. After an unremarkable workup, the patient was sent home. Ten days later, she represented to our institution's emergency room with worsening pain. Radiographs and CT scan demonstrated interval collapse of the T12 vertebral body. A linear vacuum cleft was noted on X-rays and CT. An extensive workup to exclude other processes such as malignancy or infection, which was negative, ensued. Delayed post-traumatic vertebral collapse was diagnosed. A trial of medical management and therapy was attempted, but she continued to experience significant pain. A T12 vertebroplasty was therefore offered and performed to stabilize the injury and to relieve the pain. She was subsequently able to be discharged from the hospital and transitioned back to home life. At approximately 2 years following her injury, the patient was noted to be able to ambulate with a walking aid. Her final radiograph after her surgery demonstrated that the T12 vertebroplasty had maintained its height and sagittal alignment.

Jiang,2010.0,Value of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging measurements in thoracic percutaneous vertebroplasty using unilateral,", ","BACKGROUND: Increasing the successful puncture rate of the percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in thoracic vertebral compression fracture by unilateral puncture is a problem that spinal surgeons are trying to solve. The aim of this study was to assess the value of preoperative MRI imaging measurements for PVP using a unilateral puncture. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, comparative study of two groups of osteoporotic thoracic vertebral compression fracture patients who had received a PVP using a unilateral puncture. Group A (22 patients with 27 valid vertebrae) received PVP with a unilateral puncture between October 2005 and February 2007. Group B (18 patients with 24 valid vertebrae) received a routine MRI imaging measurements before a PVP between March 2007 and June 2008. We determined the target area to puncture based on the preoperative MRI cross-sectional images of vertebra. The PVP used a simultaneous puncture through a unilateral posterolateral approach, so the vertical distance from the point of skin puncture to the posterior median line, as well as the puncture angle, were measured using the MRI. The results were used to guide the PVP operation. We compared these two groups based on the average time for a single vertebra operation, the achievement ratio of puncture, and the incidence of bone cement leakage during surgery. The mean follow-up period was 14.2 months (range 12 - 23 months). The pre- and post-operative visual analogue score (VAS) (3 and 12 months post-surgery), the variation of Oswestry disability index (ODI) and the incidence of long-term complications were also compared. RESULTS: The average time of a single vertebra operation in groups A and B were (34.7 +/- 5.4) and (23.3 +/- 4.2) minutes, respectively. In groups A and B, the success rates of puncture were 74.1% and 91.7%, respectively. Postoperative reduction of the average VAS scores in groups A and B at 3 and 12 months post-surgery were 5.8 +/- 2.1, 6.1 +/- 1.8, 6.1 +/- 2.0, 6.2 +/- 1.6, respectively. However, the ODI increase was 41.6% +/- 5.7%, 40.6% +/- 6.0%, 46.3% +/- 5.2%, 46.1% +/- 6.7%. Paired t test evaluation of the values above showed a significant difference in the time of single-vertebra operation and the success rates between groups A and B (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was seen in the reduction of VAS scores and ODI (P > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the complication rate between the two groups.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors for new vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) in patients after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and to grade the evidence according to the quality of included studies. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PVP is an effective procedure for the treatment of VCFs. A major concern after PVP in patients with osteoporosis is the occurrence of new VCFs in the untreated vertebrae. The risk factors for new VCFs after PVP reported thus far remain controversial. These risk factors have neither been well identified or summarized. This systematic review was performed to identify the risk factors for new VCFs after PVP. METHODS: Noninterventional studies evaluating the risk factors for new VCFs of patients with osteoporosis after PVP were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and OVID databases (all up to November 2012). Only observational studies with eligible data were included. Quality of included studies was assessed by a modified quality assessment tool, which was previously designed for observational study. The effects of studies were combined with the study quality score using a model of best-evidence synthesis. RESULTS: Twenty-four observational studies involving 3789 patients were included. These articles were published between 2004 and 2012. According to the quality assessment criteria for included studies, 8 studies were deemed as high-quality studies, 6 as moderate-quality studies, and 10 as low-quality studies. There were strong evidences of 3 risk factors, including lower bone mineral density, lower body mass index, intradiscal cement leakage, and vertebral height restoration. We also identified 6 moderate-evidence factors including lower body mass index, number of pre-existing vertebral fractures, thoracolumbar junction in initial VCFs, cement distraction, older age, and number of treated vertebrae. Thirteen factors were classified into the limited-evidence risk factors. CONCLUSION: Although there is no conclusive evidence for new VCFs of patients with osteoporosis after PVP procedure, these data provide evidence to guide the surgeon and develop optimal preventions for new VCFs after PVP. Special attention should be paid to the 3 strong-evidence risk factors. Further studies were still required to evaluate the effects of the earlier mentioned risk factors.

METHODS: A systematic search of all studies published through March 2012 was conducted using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, OVID, ScienceDirect and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials that compared KP to VP and provided data on safety and clinical effects were identified. Demographic characteristics, adverse events and clinical outcomes were manually extracted from all of the selected studies. The evidence quality levels and recommendations were assessed using the GRADE system. RESULTS: Twelve studies encompassing 1,081 patients met the inclusion criteria. Subgroup meta-analyses were performed according to the study design. In the RCT subgroup, there were significant differences between the two procedures in short-term visual analog scale (VAS), long-term kyphosis angles, operative times and anterior vertebrae heights. In the cohort study subgroup, there were significant differences between the two procedures in short- and long-term VAS, short- and long-term Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), cement leakage rates, short- and long-term kyphosis angles, operative times and anterior vertebrae heights. However, there were no significant differences in long-term VAS or adjacent vertebral fracture rates in the RCT subgroup. There were no significant differences in short- or long-term VAS, short- or long-term ODI, cement leakage rates, adjacent vertebral fracture rates, short- or long-term kyphosis angles or anterior vertebrae heights in the CCT subgroup, and the adjacent vertebral fracture rates did not differ significantly in the cohort study subgroup. The overall GRADE system evidence quality was very low, which lowers our confidence in their recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: KP and VP are both safe and effective surgical procedures for treating OVCF. KP may be superior to VP in patients with large kyphosis angles, vertebral fissures, fractures in the posterior edge of the vertebral body or significant height loss in the fractured vertebrae.

We measured the volume of the cement, the resorption the last 10 years and the disc height in the CT and the segmental and vertebral kyphosis angle in the X-ray and compared them with the X-ray (standing) and CT done directly postoperatively. To assess the pain level we used the VAS, ODI score, Roland Morris score and the Denis work scale and compared them with the same scores we recorded in the past. RESULTS: The VAS score demonstrated an increase over time from a mean of 1 (0-5) at the 2-year follow-up to 2.3 (0-8) at the 10-year follow-up. The Roland Morris disability score also increased over time from 2 (0-8) 2 years postoperative to a mean of 3.6 (0-18) at the 10 years follow-up. We recognized no complications and no reoperations were necessary. We recognized an increase of the median value for the vertebral kyphosis angle about 1 degrees (0 degrees -4 degrees ) (p < 0.0001). The median value of the disc height diminution over the 10 years was 0.7 mm (0-3.9) (p < 0.0001). For the anterior wall of the fractured VB the decrease of the median value was about 1 mm (0-3) (p < 0.0001) and for the posterior wall it was 0 mm (0-2) (p < 0.0039). So the beck index decreased from 0.80 (0.65-0.97) to 0.77 (0.62-0.97) at the 10-year follow-up, which means a decrease of the median value of 0.03 (0-0.07) (p < 0.0039). We noticed a median value for the cement volume of 4.2 cc (2.0-8.6) postoperative and at the 10-year follow-up of 3.2 cc (1.3-7.8), which means a resorption of the cement volume about 22.9 % (0.8-55.5 %) (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In our 10-year follow-up, we did not recognize any high loss of correction of the vertebral and segmental kyphosis angle. We also did not recognize a high diminution of the disc height without degeneration of the disc over the last 10 years. There was a partial resorption of the cement but not as much as we expected with variable bone formation. In summary, the long follow-up about 10 years of kyphoplasty show us very good clinical and radiological results and in our opinion we consider this to be a treatment option for traumatic selected vertebral type A fractures also in young patients.",eng,0.0

An alternative treatment to medical therapy for pain caused by recent VFs is percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). Patients were treated by PVP after careful selection, based on the presence of persistent pain not resolved by standard medical therapy, correlation between pain and level of the VF, and neuroradiological features. We performed PVP in 4 patients with generalized MG associated with recent steroid-induced symptomatic VFs. Relief from pain was very rapid, usually within 24 h, and retained at a 3-month evaluation. No severe complication or MG worsening were observed in the post-operative period. Although clinical indication for PVP is still controversial, in our experience PVP is a useful and safe tool to be considered in the management of recent steroid-induced symptomatic VFs in selected MG patients.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively compared two groups of patients with symptomatic vertebral fractures who had no significant response to conservative therapy. Pathologic substrate included osteoporosis (n = 77), metastasis (n = 24), multiple myeloma (n = 13), hemangioma (n = 15), and lymphoma (n = 1). Group A patients (n = 94) underwent PVP of up to three treated vertebrae (n = 188). Group B patients (n = 36) underwent PVP with more than three treated vertebrae per session (n = 220). Decreased pain and improved mobility were recorded the day after surgery and at 12 and 24 months after surgery per clinical evaluation and the use of numeric visual scales (NVS): the Greek Brief Pain Inventory, a linear analogue self-assessment questionnaire, and a World Health Organization questionnaire. RESULTS: Group A presented with a mean pain score of 7.9 +/- 1.1 NVS units before PVP, which decreased to 2.1 +/- 1.6, 2.0 +/- 1.5 and 2.0 +/- 1.5 NVS units the day after surgery and at 12 and 24 months after surgery, respectively. Group B presented with a mean pain score of 8.1 +/- 1.3 NVS units before PVP, which decreased to 2.2 +/- 1.3, 2.0 +/- 1.5, and 2.1 +/- 1.6 NVS units the day after surgery and at 12 and 24 months after surgery, respectively. Overall pain decrease and mobility improvement throughout the follow-up period presented no statistical significance neither between the two groups nor between different underlying aetiology. Reported cement leakages presented no statistical significance between the two groups (p = 0.365).

Journal Article,N. A. Manson; F. M. Phillips,2007.0,Minimally invasive techniques for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures,", ","Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a leading cause of disability and morbidity in the elderly. The consequences of these fractures include pain, progressive vertebral collapse with resultant spinal kyphosis, and systemic manifestations. Nonsurgical measures have proved unsuccessful in a portion of this population and for this group, minimally invasive vertebral augmentation can be beneficial. Vertebroplasty is designed to address vertebral fracture pain. It involves percutaneous injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) directly into a fractured vertebral body with the goals of pain relief and prevention of further collapse of the fractured vertebra. Kyphoplasty is designed to address the kyphotic deformity as well as the fracture pain. It involves the percutaneous insertion of an inflatable bone tamp into a fractured vertebral body. Bone tamp inflation works to elevate the end plates and create a cavity to be filled with PMMA with the goals of pain relief, restoration of vertebral body height, and reduced kyphotic deformity. Optimizing surgical technique can improve outcomes and decrease complication rates, and decrease radiation exposure to the patient and surgical team. Obtaining a biopsy prior to cement injection has proved efficacious and may result in the diagnosis of occult pathology underlying a seemingly routine vertebral fracture. As competence and surgical success are acquired, the indications will continue to expand to encompass more challenging pathologies. Recently, vertebral augmentation during spinal decompression and instrumented fusion for burst fracture with neurologic insult has been reported to be successful.",eng,0.0

We investigated diagnostic key factors of such occult VFs and evaluated the effects of cement augmentation in these patients. METHODS: A total of 225 patients with VFs treated with vertebroplasty (VP) or kyphoplasty (KP) were retrospectively analyzed. All patients have taken preoperatively magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including T1/T2-weighted images and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences, and 45 patients met the inclusion criteria. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by comparing visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) values preoperatively, postoperatively, and at the final follow-up. RESULTS: MRI (T1 and STIR sequences) showed bone marrow edema in all fresh fractures including occult VFs and concomitant VFs; five patients showed no abnormality signal in their T2-weighted sequences of occult VFs. While 40 patients underwent KP, and five patients underwent VP. We did not find delayed collapsed fractures in the augmented occult VFs in both groups after operation. Both groups had significant improvement in pain and functional activity after the intervention (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The presence of previous or concomitant VFs leads to further imaging examination, which helps identify the occult VFs. Preoperative MRI examination especially T1 and STIR sequences plays a vital role in the early diagnosis of occult VFs. Except for significant pain relief and functional improvement, VP and KP can effectively prevent delayed vertebral collapse of occult VFs comparing to previous reported data.",eng,1.0

Only 6.4 % of them were operated by vertebroplasty; these patients were younger and healthier than non-operated patients. INTRODUCTION: This study aims to describe the burden of vertebral fractures from the 2009 French Hospital National Database in acute care in people aged 60 years and over, with or without vertebroplasty. METHODS: All stays due to nonmalignant and nontraumatic vertebral fractures as primary cause were selected. Patients' characteristics were described and compared between patients with or without vertebroplasty. The in-patient mortality was compared to the one related to hip and upper humerus fracture in patients hospitalized during the same year. RESULTS: In 2009, 13,624 patients were hospitalized for vertebral fracture. Men accounted for 29.3 % of cases. Length of stay was 9.6 +/- 8.2 days, higher in patients with at least one comorbidity than in patients without (11.2 +/- 8.6 and 7.8 +/- 7.2 days, respectively). The in-patient mortality was 0.9 %; it was 3.8 and 1.1 % for hip and upper humerus fractures, respectively. Vertebroplasty was performed in 6.4 % of them. Patients with vertebroplasty were younger (mean age of 75 +/- 8 versus 79 +/- 9 years), had a less duration of stay (7 +/- 7.5 versus 9.8 +/- 8.2 days), less comorbidities (at least one comorbidity, 45 versus 54 %), and less in-patient mortality (0.1 versus 0.9 %). Rehospitalization for vertebral fracture occurred in 9 and 6 % of the patient with and without vertebroplasty. CONCLUSION: This is the first French study assessing the national burden of vertebral fractures based on hospital data. In-hospital death rate is lower in patients with vertebroplasty, who are younger and have less comorbidities than the general population with vertebral fractures.",eng,1.0

METHODS: In this longitudinal, prospective, consecutive study, patients received BKP at one or more vertebral levels. The BKP procedure was guided by computed tomographic fluoroscopy. Orthopaedic bone tamps were inflated to create a cavity and the fracture was stabilised using viscous polymethylmethacrylate bone cement. After the procedure, early mobilisation was encouraged. RESULTS: Overall, 115 patients (52.2% with vertebral fractures) received BKP. The majority (82.6%) of patients received BKP as a stand-alone procedure. BKP treatment provided significant (P<0.0001) improvements in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)-pain (median change: -4), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI; mean change: -53.2), and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS; median change: 15) scores at 6 and 12 months. In total, 23% of patients achieved increased vertebral height (7.4% mean improvement in angle index). The presence of height restoration and the number of levels treated did not affect VAS or ODI scores; improvements in KPS scores were numerically higher in patients who received BKP plus additional surgery (15-20) compared with stand-alone BKP (10-15).

The relatively high risk of extravertebral leakage due to uncontrolled delivery of low viscosity bone cement is an inherent limitation of the technique. The aim of this research is to investigate the ability of controlled cement delivery in decreasing the rate of such complications by applying radiofrequency heating to regulate cement viscosity. METHOD AND MATERIAL: Thirty two vetebrae were treated in 28 patients as part of an Ethics Committee approved multicenter clinical trial using RadioFreqency assisted Percutaenous Vertebral Augmentation (RF-PVA) technique. This technique is injecting low viscosity polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement using a pressure controlled hydraulic pump and applying radiofrequency heating to increase cement viscosity prior to entering the vertebral body. All patients were screened for any cement leakage by X-ray and CT scan. The intensity of pain was recorded on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the level of physical activity on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) prior to, one day, one month and three months following procedure. RESULTS: All procedures were technically successful. There were no clinical complication, intraspinal or intraforaminal cement leakage. In nine cases (29%) a small amount of PMMA entered the intervertebral space through the broken end plate. Intensity of pain by VAS was reduced from a mean of 7.0 to 2.5 and physical inactivity dropped on the ODI from 52% to 23% three months following treatment. CONCLUSION: In this small series controlled cement injection using RF-PVA was capable of preventing clinically hazardous extravertebral cement leakage while achieving outcomes similar to that of conventional vertebroplasty.",hun,0.0

Clinical trials and observational studies that included alive adults with osteoporotic vertebral body fractures and the comparators were the intervention himself, vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty were selected. Quality of evidence was graded according to the GRADE approach. Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Forty-two citations were identified during the search. After removing duplicates, five studies were included: two clinical trials and three observational studies. Stentoplasty, showed higher rate of adverse events related to material (P=0.043) and cuff pressure (P=0.014) in comparison to kyphoplasty. There was no difference between two procedures in terms of reduction of kyphosis, time of exposure to radiation or postoperative loss of cement. Stentoplasty in comparison to vertebroplasty, showed an improvement of restoration of vertebral height (P=0.042), kyphosis correction and volume of bone cement.

Stentoplasty improves vertebral height, reduces the pain and functional disability and correct the vertebral angle in patients with osteoporotic vertebral body fracture with minimum adverse events. Stentoplasty is comparable to kyphoplasty in terms of correction of kyphosis, time of exposure to radiation and cement postoperative loss, and comparable to vertebroplasty in terms of restoration of vertebral height correction and bone cement volume.

Vengust,2015.0,Minimum cement volume for vertebroplasty,10.1007/s00264-014-2620-7,"PURPOSE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a widely used vertebral augmentation technique. It is a minimally invasive and low-risk procedure, but has some disadvantages with a relatively high number of bone cement leaks and adjacent vertebral fractures. The aim of this cadaveric study was to determine the minimum percentage of cement fill volume in vertebroplasty needed to restore vertebral stiffness and adjacent intradiscal pressure. METHODS: Thirteen thoracolumbar spine mobile segments were loaded to induce a vertebral fracture. After fracture vertebroplasty was performed, four times in the same fractured vertebra. The injected cement volume was 5 % of the fractured vertebral volume to reach 5, 10, 15 and 20 % of cement fill. Biomechanical testing was performed before the fracture, after the fracture and after each cement injection. RESULTS: After vertebral fracture compressive stiffness was reduced to 47 % of the pre-fracture value and was partially restored to 61 % after 10 % cement fill. With vertebroplasty intradiscal pressure gradually increased, depending on specimen position, from 48 to a total of 71 % at 15 % of cement fill. CONCLUSIONS: Compressive stiffness and intradiscal pressure increase with the percentage of cement fill. Fifteen per cent of cement fill was the limit beyond which no substantial increase in compressive stiffness or intradiscal pressure could be detected and is the minimum volume of cement we recommend for vertebroplasty. In the average thoracolumbar vertebra this means 4-6 ml of cement.",eng,1.0

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk factors related to the development of VF after VP in these patients. We evaluated risk factors including age, gender, bone mineral density, the number, type, and severity of vertebral deformities at baseline, the number of vertebral bodies treated, the presence and location of disk cement leakage, bone remodeling (determining bone turnover markers) and 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels at baseline in all patients. Twenty-nine radiologically new VF were observed in 17 of 57 patients undergoing VP, 72% adjacent to the VP. Patients developing VF after VP showed an increased prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) and higher P1NP values. The principal factor related to the development of VF after VP in multivariate analysis was 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/mL (RR, 15.47; 95% CI, 2.99-79.86, p < 0.0001), whereas age >80 years (RR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.70-6.03, p = 0.0007) and glucocorticoid therapy (RR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.61-8.26, p = 0.0055) constituted the principal factors in the overall study population. Increased risk of VF after VP was also associated with cement leakage into the inferior disk (RR, 6.14; 95% CI, 1.65-22.78, p = 0.044) and more than one vertebral body treated during VP (RR, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.03-34.3, p = 0.044). In conclusion, nearly 30% of patients with osteoporotic VF treated with VP had a new VF after the procedure. Age, especially >80 years, the presence of inferior disk cement leakage after the procedure, the number of cemented vertebrae, and low 25(OH)D serum levels were related to the development of new VF in these patients, with the latter indicating the need to correct vitamin D deficiency prior to performing VP.",eng,0.0

However, the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach in the treatment of painful chronic vertebral fractures is less clear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this report we evaluate the short and long-term effectiveness in pain relief of PVP in a group of 5 patients with pain related to chronic osteoporotic vertebral fractures without bone marrow edema (BME) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All patients were followed during one year, assessing analgesic use, pain evolution (on a 10-point visual analog scale [VAS]), new vertebral fractures and other clinical complications. Seven procedures were performed in the 5 patients. RESULTS: All patients reported substantial improvement in back pain 2 weeks after the procedure, with a mean decrease of 53% in the VAS. However, one year after PVP most patients (4 out 5) worsened, achieving similar VAS scores to those obtained at baseline. No additional vertebral fractures or other clinical complications were observed. CONCLUSION: The present cases suggest that the long-term effectiveness of PVP in the treatment of painful chronic vertebral fractures without BME on MRI is scarce.",spa,0.0

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal osteolytic lesions are frequently associated with hematologic malignancies due to primary localization of disease (multiple myeloma and rarely lymphoma) or secondary effect of intensive corticosteroid therapy. METHODS: We treated 64 patients (34 males, 30 females; mean age 71.4+/-9.6 y) with pain refractory to conventional medical therapy (analgesics, bed-rest, bracing with orthopedic devices for more than 3 wk) localized in spine, in the absence of neurologic signs. RESULTS: This treatment generated swift pain relief associated with an evident augmentation in vertebral resistance. Average preprocedural pain level for all patients was reported to be 8.04+/-1.4 whereas average pain level at 1 and 6 months follow-up period was 1.82+/-1.84 and 1.92+/-1.68, respectively. Although preprocedure and postprocedure demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in numeric pain scores (P<0.01), the pain level at 1 and 6 months was not considered statistically significant. No procedure-related complications were observed in either leakages of polymethylmethacrylate in the epidural or foraminal area or in complications of pulmonary embolism for venous plexus involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty is widely considered as an alternative, effective, simple, and safe technique in the treatment of neoplastic vertebral localizations consequent to hematologic malignancies. The same injection of polymethylmethacrylate can be executed before radiation therapy treatment, synergizing its delayed analgesic action to pain, after failure or in the case of local recurrences.",eng,1.0

In the cervical spine, however, percutaneous vertebroplasty is technically challenging because of the complex anatomy of this region. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We evaluated the technical feasibility, complication rate, and ability of percutaneous vertebroplasty to provide pain relief in patients with painful metastatic cervical fractures. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 62 patients (24 men) who, between May 2005 and May 2009, underwent vertebroplasty to treat painful metastatic cervical fractures. Each patient was evaluated by a visual analog scale for pain, number of pain analgesics, and CT and MRI before, the day after, and at 3 months after the procedure. RESULTS: Two of the 62 patients had asymptomatic cement leakage in the soft tissues. We observed no delayed complications. Mean pretreatment and 24-hour posttreatment visual analog scale pain scores were 7.9+/-1.7 and 1.5+/-2, respectively. Immediately after surgery, the pain completely disappeared in 25 (40%) patients. Administration of analgesics was suspended in 34 (55%) patients whereas in 27 (39%) patients the median analgesics use decreased from two pills per day (range, 0-3) to 0 (range, 0-3). In two (3%) patients, analgesics administration was continued due to the persistence of pain. At 3 months, the patients reported a mean visual analog scale pain score of 1.7+/-2. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest, in selected patients, percutaneous vertebroplasty may be performed with a high technical success rate combined with a low complication rate, providing immediate pain relief lasting at least 3 months and a reduction in the use of analgesic drugs.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 23 patients with single vertebral metastasis treated with combined procedure of CVT, compared with those obtained in 23 patients treated by vertebroplasty. Pain intensity was evaluated by a visual analog scale (VAS) score administered before and 1 day, 1 week, and 1, 3, and 6 months after procedure. Quality of life was evaluated by an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score administered before and at 3 and 6 months after procedure. RESULTS: Procedural success was achieved in all patients without any complications. The VAS and ODI scores showed a reduction in both groups during follow-up (VAS score, p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively; ODI score, p < 0.0001).

Vertebral fractures usually become manifest due to pain which can be debilitating. Treatment depends on the presence or absence of spinal cord involvement. In the first case, surgical stabilization is mandatory. In the second case, treatment may be performed either by conservative medical therapy (CMT) or percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness, costs and cost-effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty. After 2 weeks of analgesic therapy, 153 patients presented refractory pain and were offered treatment by PVT. A total of 58 patients accepted and underwent PVT (PVT group), while 95 refused and underwent conservative medical therapy (CMT group). Follow-up was performed by specialist consults, spine radiography and MRI and a self-assessment questionnaire evaluating pain using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and function using an ambulation and an Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. A 12-month follow-up was obtained in 86 of 95 (90.5%) CMT group patients and 54 of 58 (93.1%) PVT group patients. Significant reduction of VAS and improvement of ambulation and ADL was observed in both groups at 1 week and 3 and 12 months (P < 0.05; Wilcoxon signed rank test), however, these results were significantly superior in the PVT group at 1 week and 3 months (P < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). Average cost per patient at 1 week and 3 and 12 months were respectively 755.49 +/- 661.96, 3791.95 +/- 3341.97 and 4299.55 +/- 3211.53 euros (CMT group) and 3311.35 +/- 0.32, 3745.30 +/- 3.59 and 4101.05 +/- 755.41 euros (PVT group). PVT resulted significantly more cost-effective than CMT with regards to the three scales at 1 week (P < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). At 3 months PVT was more cost-effective than CMT with regards to the three scales, however, the difference was significant only with regards to ambulation. No significant differences in cost-effectiveness where found between the two groups at 12 months. PVT should be considered the treatment of first choice in symptomatic acute amyelic osteoporotic vertebral fractures with refractory pain after a short period of analgesic therapy.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Forty-five patients affected by COPD and single dorsal OVCF underwent VTP (29 men, 16 women; mean age 71.4 years, range 65-77 years). Inclusion criteria were magnetic resonance findings of bone marrow oedema, without intracanal bone fragments and refractory pain to medical treatment for at least 3 months. Osteoporosis was assessed by bone densitometry. Spirometry was performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: A significant VAS-score decrease was observed 1 week after VTP, with a subsequent decrease over time; vital capacity (VC) and forced vital capacity (FVC) improved over time, reaching a plateau at 3 months. Forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1) did not significantly differ between the pre-VTP values and follow-up values. A significant correlation was observed between VAS-score values and VC, and VAS-score values and FVC. No significant correlation was observed between VAS-score values and FEV1 values.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Follow-up analysis was made through a questionnaire completed by the patients before and after PVP (1 week, 1 year and 3 years). The results are reported by subdivision of patients into groups (by gender, age and number of treated vertebrae), with special reference to pain management, drug administration and quality of life. RESULTS: All patients (285) were followed up for 1 week, 186 for 12 months, and 68 patients were followed up for 3 years. One week after PVP all patients reported normal ambulation (with or without pain), and more than 95% were able to perform activities of daily living (ADL) either without pain or with mild pain. There was no difference in pain relief between the genders after 1 week's follow up, but after 3 years better analgesia results were observed in women. There was no statistically significant difference in the visual analogue scale (VAS) values before PVP between age groups (P = 0.7) and gender (P = 0.4); Patients younger than 75 years had better outcomes than did older ones (>75 years) at 1 week and 1 year follow up.

Vertebral fractures usually become evident because of pain of varying intensity that reduces the patient's quality of life, producing functional limitations, depression, disability, height loss, spinal instability and kyphotic deformity associated with impaired lung capacity. Many diseases may underlie vertebral compression fractures, such as osteoporosis, trauma, neoplasms and haemangioma.

Patients enrolling criteria were age >20 years and symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral collapse from low-energy trauma encompassed between levels T5 to L5. Preoperative and postoperative imaging studies consisted of computed tomography, plain X-ray, dual X-ray absorptiometry scanning, and magnetic resonance. Pain intensity has been evaluated by an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) and physical and quality of life compromise assessments have been evaluated by Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI). All procedures have been performed fluoroscopically guided by left unilateral approach under local anesthesia and mild sedation.
RESULTS: VAS-based pain trend over the 12-month follow-up has shown a statistically significant (p<0.001) decrease, starting from 7.68 (SD 1.83) preoperatively with an immediate first day decrease at 3.51 (SD 2.16) and 0.96 (SD 0.93) at 12 months. ODI score dropped significantly from 54.78% to 20.12% at 6 months. No device-related complication has been reported. In no case a new incidental adjacent fracture has been reported.
CONCLUSION: Data show how this injectable partly resorbable ceramic cement could be a nontoxic and lower stiffness alternative to polymethylmethacrylate for immediate and long-term stabilization of osteoporotic collapsed vertebral bodies.",English,0.0

RESULTS: In patients, selected after evaluation with MRI and bone scan imaging, both procedures demonstrated swift pain relief associated with vertebral resistance augmentation. CONCLUSION: MRI revealed itself to be equivalent to bone scan imaging in selecting patients to be treated with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in the first 3/4 months, while bone scintigraphy was more accurate in the evaluation of elderly fractures (> 3/4 months).

METHODS: We treated 35 patients [29 (82.85 %) men, 6 (17.14 %) women, mean age 34.05 +/- 8.36 years (range 21-54 years)] with single type A1.1 and A1.2 thoracolumbar traumatic vertebral fracture without endospecal bone fragments. Pain intensity was evaluated before and at 1 day; 1 week; and 1, 6, and 12 months after VTP by a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) score (0 = no pain, 10 = unbearable pain). Physical status and quality of life were evaluated by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire before and 1, 6, and 12 months after VTP. RESULTS: Procedural technical success was achieved in all patients with no deaths observed during follow-up. In three patients (8.57 %), postprocedural CT showed cement leakages: one intradiscal and two in venous plexus. No adjacent vertebral body fractures nor intrasomatic recollapse was detected. The VAS and ODI scores showed a statistically significant reduction 1 week after procedure (P value <0.0001) with a progressive statistically significant reduction during follow-up (P value <0.0001). Twenty-three patients (65.71 %) assigned a value of 0 to the VAS scale at 1 year after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Strontium-hydroxyapatite bone cement is an effective and safe bone filler in percutaneous vertebroplasty with low leakage rate and absence of major complications when performed by a skilled equipe.

Journal Article,J. Matejka; J. Zeman; J. Belatka; T. Matejka; P. Nepras,2011.0,[Vertebral body augmentation using a vertebral body stent],", ","PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Osteoporotic vertebral fractures can be treated by minimally invasive percutaneous vertebral augmentation with bone cement using vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty. Transcutaneous reduction and vertebral body stenting has been the most recent principle. In contrast to balloon placement in kyphoplasty, the stent remains in the vertebral body and supports both the vertebral body and cement filling. In this retrospective study we present the essential information on the method and our first results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The method of vertebral body stent placement was used in 22 patients treated at 29 levels. Of these, 19 patients with 26 segments followed up for 3 months were evaluated. The group included 12 women and seven men with an average age of 68.3 years (12 to 83). The patients assessed their subjective complaints on the visual analogue scale (VAS) before surgery, and then at 1, 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively. The value of vertebral body reduction was obtained by measurement of anterior, middle and posterior vertebral body heights (AVBH, MVBH and PVBH, respectively) and a change in the vertebral body kyphotic angle (VBKA). RESULTS: Twenty-four vertebrae were treated for osteoporotic fracture and two as preventive stenting in metastatic breast cancer. In 24 fractures, the stents extended fully in 20 vertebrae, i.e., 40 stents. These fractures evidently were not older than 3 months. In four segments, a total of eight stents did not extend at all or did only slightly. The 20 stabilised vertebral bodies had an average AVBH value of 19.41 mm pre-operatively and that of 22.775 mm post-operatively, which is an average increase by 3.365 mm in absolute numbers and by 17.34 %. The average pre- and post-operative MVBH values were 16.625 mm and 23.065 mm, which was improvement by 6.41 mm or by 38.56 %. The average PVBH values pre- and post-operatively were 26.835 mm and 28.31 mm, which meant improvement by 1.475 mm or by 5.5 %. The average correction of the kyphotic angle was 4.58 degrees , i.e., 35.2 %, from a VBKA of 11.71 degrees pre-operatively to 7.13 degrees post-operatively. There were five cases (22.7 %) of cement leakage, i.e., two of ventral leakage, one of lateral leakage, one of dorsal leakage through a canal left in the pedicle by cannula insertion, and a dorsal leakage in metastatic disease. No neurological findings were recorded. The average VAS scores were as follows: 81.4 before surgery, 30.6 at 1 week, 16.3 at 6 weeks and 15.4 at 12 weeks after surgery. DISCUSSION: Two experimental and one clinical study on vertebral body stenting only have been available in the recent relevant literature. In comparison with their results as well as with those of previous reports on vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, our results showed high quality fracture reduction in all vertebrae. The rapid decrease in pain intensity in our group is comparable with all available groups treated by any method of vertebral body augmentation by cement injection; and cement leakage was recorded in even fewer cases. CONCLUSIONS: The novel method of vertebral body stenting with cement augmentation provides a rapid pain relief, gives stability to fracture reduction and has a low rate of cement leakage. However, care must be taken not to indicate cases with a damaged posterior corticalis of the vertebral body.",cze,0.0

OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to develop and validate an FEM-based tool for predicting polymer-augmented lytic vertebral fracture load and stiffness and the influence of metastatic filling materials. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty has the potential to reduce vertebral fracture risk affected with lytic metastases by providing mechanical stabilization. However, it has been shown that the mismatch in mechanical properties between poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) and bone induces secondary fractures and intervertebral disc degeneration. A biodegradable copolymer, poly(propylene fumarate-co-caprolactone) (P(PF-co-CL)), has been shown to possess the appropriate mechanical properties for bone defect repair. METHODS: Simulated metastatic lytic defects were created in 40 cadaveric vertebral bodies, which were randomized into 4 groups: intact vertebral body (intact), simulated defect without treatment (negative), defect treated with P(PF-co-CL) (copolymer), and defect treated with PMMA (PMMA). Spines were imaged with quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and QCT/FEM-subject-specific, nonlinear models were created. Predicted fracture loads and stiffness were identified and compared with experimentally measured values using Pearson correlation analysis and paired t test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the measured and predicted fracture loads and stiffness for each group. Predicted fracture loads were larger for PMMA augmentation (3960 N [1371 N]) than that for the copolymer, negative and intact groups (3484 N [1497 N], 3237 N [1744 N], and 1747 N [702 N]). A similar trend was observed in the predicted stiffness. Moreover, predicted and experimental fracture loads were strongly correlated (R=0.78), whereas stiffness showed moderate correlation (R=0.39). CONCLUSION: QCT/FEM was successful for predicting fracture loads of metastatic, polymer-augmented vertebral bodies. Overall, we have demonstrated that QCT/FEM may be a useful tool for predicting in situ vertebral fracture load resulting from vertebroplasty. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.",eng,1.0

Ishiguro,2004.0,Vertebral reconstruction with biodegradable calcium phosphate cement in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture using instrumentation,", ","OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of posterior instrumentation and vertebral reconstruction with biodegradable calcium phosphate cement (CPC) in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with neurologic deficit. BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty consists of the injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement into the vertebral body. While PMMA has high mechanical strength, it cures fast and thus allows only a short handling time. Other potential problems of using PMMA injection may include damage to surrounding tissues due to the high polymerization temperature or by the toxic unreacted monomer and the lack of long-term biocompatibility. Bone mineral cements such as calcium carbonate and CPCs have a longer working time and low thermal effect. They are also biodegradable while providing good mechanical strength. However, the viscosity of injectable mineral cements is high, and the infiltration of these cements into the vertebral body has been questioned. Recently, the infiltration properties of CPC have been significantly improved, making it more suitable for injection into the vertebral bodies for vertebral reconstruction. METHODS: Five patients were included in this open prospective study. Inclusion criteria were delayed collapsed vertebral compression fractures responsible for severe pain and neurologic dysfunction necessitating posterior decompression surgery. Of five patients, two were male and three were female with an average age at surgery of 80.4 years (71-85 years) and an average duration of follow-up of 2.5 years (2-3.5 years). Evaluation of clinical data was based on x-ray, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score for low back pain (full score is 29 points), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). RESULTS: The levels of the delayed collapsed vertebrae were T10, L1, and L2 (for one patient each) and L4 (two patients). All patients were in poor condition, for example, renal failure, heart failure, and chronic hepatitis. The average operative time was 2 hours (1 hour 36 minutes to 2 hours 16 minutes), and intraoperative bleeding was 181 mL (85-236 mL). As for clinical symptoms, preoperative JOA score averaged 17.8 points and was improved to 26 points postoperatively, while the preoperative VAS score of 8.6 points improved to 2 points postoperatively. Morphologic evaluation showed preoperative vertebral compression ratio averaged 41% and improved to 74% immediately after the operation and finally settled at 68%. Just one of five cases experienced late vertebral collapse 3 months after the operation. CONCLUSION: Vertebral reconstruction with biodegradable CPC in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture using instrumentation was a safe and useful surgical treatment.",eng,0.0

CASE REPORT: The authors describe a case of a 54-year-old patient presenting with low-back pain after having struck her back on the handrail. The neurological exam was unremarkable. The CT-scan of the lumbar spine demonstrated a L1 comminuted burst fracture. The MRI demonstrated no evidence of posterior ligamentous complex injury. According to the TLICS classification (total score of 2) the patient was managed conservatively with a thoracolumbar brace. Although at the 1-month follow-up the X-rays demonstrated no major changes and the pain had clinically improved, the patient was lost to follow-up. After 12 months the patient presented back to the emergency department with complaints of increased back pain. The repeat CT-scan demonstrated a remarkable worsening of the vertebral body fracture, with a major kyphotic deformity. The patient was submitted to a staged anterior-posterior procedure consisting in posterior decompression of the T12-L2 levels, a T10-L4 pedicle screw fixation and, finally, a lateral transpsoas approach for L1 corpectomy and reconstruction with an expandable interbody cage and plate fixation. At the 6-months follow-up, the patient presented another episode of back pain and a new L4 endplate fracture was identified. After 2 months of failed conservative treatment, the patient was treated with percutaneous kyphoplasty. At the 12-months follow-up after the initial surgical procedure, the patient was pain free and with stable radiographs. CONCLUSIONS: In this Grand Rounds presentation, the authors perform a comprehensive discussion about the historical developments in the classification systems for thoracolumbar fractures with special emphasis in the new TLICS system. Although such score presents several advantages in relation to other grading systems, patients with comminuted burst fractures deserve special attention, even if initially classified as non-operative according to the TLICS algorithm. In such cases, if a decision of conservative management is taken, a close follow-up is recommended due to the high likelihood of long-term kyphotic deformity.",eng,0.0

In such scenario, because of the presence of poor bone quality, the strength of the spinal construct is of paramount importance. Although several studies have demonstrated the benefits of cement augmentation in increasing the pullout strength of pedicle screw fixation, the injection of cement during placement of pedicle screws may hamper the possibility of additional circumferential screw fixation. In addition, cement injection into vertebral bodies full of tumor and in the presence of adjacent epidural disease may incur in higher risks of tumor extravasation and worsening of neurological deficits than cement injection after initiation of adjuvant therapies. CASE DESCRIPTION: The advantages of delayed trans-instrumentation vertebroplasty after 360-degree fixation are discussed in this technical note with an illustrative case of a patient with multiple myeloma presenting with cauda equina syndrome after a T12 compression fracture. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the associated challenges of such an interventional procedure due to the presence of extensive hardware, carrying out delayed trans-instrumentation vertebroplasty after 360-degree circumferential fixations is not only feasible, but in our opinion, may constitute the best strategy to optimize the strength of spinal instrumentation in challenging scenarios involving poor bone quality, such as in patients with multiple myeloma.",eng,0.0

Bourekas,2014.0,Vertebral compression fractures in patients under treatment with denosumab: a contraindication for percutaneous vertebroplasty?,10.1016/j.spinee.2013.11.046,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Denosumab (XGeva) is a receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)-antibody that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 for the prevention of skeletal fractures in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. Although there is a widespread use of such drug in patients under risk of pathological fractures, the compatibility of denosumab therapy with percutaneous vertebroplasty (an interventional procedure commonly used for pain control in such population) has not yet been established. PURPOSE: To present the serial imaging findings and technical report of an attempted percutaneous vertebroplasty in a patient with refractory pain and a lytic pathological vertebral fracture related to small cell lung cancer spinal metastasis and who was actively under medical treatment with denosumab. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review and case report. METHODS: The authors present the imaging findings and technical report of an attempted percutaneous vertebroplasty in the only patient found to be actively under treatment with denosumab after a retrospective review of the databank of patients with pathological fractures referred to the Department of Radiology of the Ohio State University for percutaneous vertebroplasty (a total sample of 20 patients) since the FDA approval of denosumab (November 2010) until June 2013 (a 30-month period). RESULTS: Although the computed tomography scan of the thoracic spine, performed 6 weeks after the initiation of the treatment with denosumab, presented a remarkable remodeling of the previously lytic vertebral lesion (which became markedly sclerotic in appearance), the clinical response in terms of pain improvement was not satisfactory. At the time of the percutaneous vertebroplasty (which was indicated for pain control), after advancing the 11-gauge needle through the pedicle with extreme difficulty, the needle repeatedly deviated laterally and, despite several attempts, it was not possible to penetrate the vertebral body and perform the cement injection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the technical peculiarities of percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients under medical treatment with denosumab. According to our experience, because of its RANKL-mediated effects on osteoclasts activity, denosumab has been shown to induce a fast and marked sclerotic response on vertebral bodies that may not be accompanied by a satisfactory improvement in pain control (especially in patients with mechanical type of pain) and which may actually prevent the successful performance of percutaneous vertebroplasty. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that future studies evaluating patients with vertebral fractures under treatment with denosumab include long-term pain outcome measures. Additionally, further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal order of treatment and the best timeframe for combining percutaneous vertebroplasty and denosumab therapy in patients presenting with acute vertebral compression fractures and refractory axial pain.",eng,0.0

The ability of this procedure to relieve pain better than conservative treatment is still debated. The purpose of this study was to compare the degree and duration of pain relief following PVP with that following conservative treatment for osteoporotic compression fractures by means of meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. METHODS: The CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Web of Science databases were queried for randomized controlled trials comparing PVP with conservative treatment or placebo/sham. The methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's domain-based evaluation framework. Random-effects meta-analysis of the raw mean difference between groups in change in pain level was performed, with sensitivity analyses and the Egger test for potential publication bias. RESULTS: Of 209 records found, 11 were considered relevant, involving 1,048 participants. The risk of bias was considered low in 10 studies and high in 1. The 531 patients treated with PVP had a significantly lower pain level compared with the control group at 1 to 2 weeks, 2 to 3 months, and 12 months. The 95% CI (confidence interval) of the pooled effect size at every time interval included the score of 1.5, considered to be the minimal clinically important difference. The largest pooled effect size of -1.4 (95% CI, -2.3 to -0.5) was found during the first 1 to 2 weeks. The heterogeneity was high at all 3 time points (I(2), 71% to 96%). No significant publication bias was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 1 year postoperatively, the effect of PVP exceeded the effect of conservative therapy with respect to pain relief in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures.

Fluoroscopic localization of the fractured vertebra using two conventional C-arm devices (anteroposterior and lateral views). Fluoroscopic localization of the fractured vertebra using two conventional C-arm devices (anteroposterior and lateral views). An introducer is inserted through a small skin incision into the pedicle under fluoroscopic guidance. To create a site- and size-specific three-dimensional cavity in the center of the fractured vertebra, the navigational VertecoR MidLine Osteotome was inserted through the correctly sited introducer and guided fluoroscopically. As the MidLine Osteotome allows angulation of the tip up to 90 degrees by rotating the handle, a cavity over the midline of the vertebral body can mainly be created through one pedicle. The radiofrequency activated cohesive ultrahigh viscosity PMMA cement (ER(2) bone cement) is injected stepwise on demand by remote control under continuous pressure from the hydraulic assembly into the vertebral body. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Bed rest for 6 h postoperatively in supine position. Early mobilization without a corset on the day of surgery. Specific back and abdominal exercises that strengthen the back and abdominal muscles. Pain dependent increase of weight bearing. Continue osteoporosis therapy and start specific drug therapy according to the local guidlines if necessary.

All the patients studied experienced an early and persistent significant pain relief even 12 months after therapy (8 +/- 1.4 vs. 2.7 +/- 1.9) according to the visual analogue pain scale. According to the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) as a disease-specific disability measure all the patients improved significantly (p < 0.001) in the level of disability after operative treatment (56.2 +/- 18.8 vs. 34.5 +/- 16.6). Cement leakage was detected in 17 out of 62 (27.4 %) augmented vertebrae, whereas all the patients with cement leakage remained asymptomatic. One patient had subsequent vertebral fractures after a period of 6 months.",ger,0.0

Grifka,2010.0,[Orthotic methods for osteoporosis and osteoporotic vertebral fracture],10.1007/s00132-010-1596-2,"Even in times of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, braces remain an efficient option in the treatment of osteoporotic hyperkyphosis due to imminent or manifest vertebral wedging with the obligatory pain and fracture risk of adjacent vertebraes. In the same fashion, acute osteoporotic fractures with considerable backpain can be treated with an adequate orthosis besides analgetics and osteological drugs. Essential is the careful selection of the right brace for a given type of osteoporotic fracture: Overall brace-frames (Stagnara type) should be used only in highly unstable or multiple osteoporotic fractures with impact onto the spinal canal where surgery is not possible. These brace frames should be administered only for the shortest possible period (8-12 weeks) to reduce muscle atrophy and immobilization. However, in the typical stable osteoporotic wedge fracture, light weight constructions like the Jewett or Bahler-Vogt brace or - in less severe cases - dynamic braces (e.g. TorsoStretch brace or SpinoMedActive brace) should be used to minimize muscle atrophy and demineralisation. Brace treatment at its best though, can be only one step in the cascade of measures to fight demineralisation and the clinical consequences: General physiotherapy, analgetics and specific osteological drugs and minerals add essentially to the treatment.",ger,0.0

Kallmes,2000.0,Value of bone scan imaging in predicting pain relief from percutaneous vertebroplasty in osteoporotic vertebral fractures,", ","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patient selection for percutaneous vertebroplasty is often complicated by the presence of multiple fractures or non-localizing pain. Our purpose was to determine whether increased activity revealed by bone scan imaging is predictive of a positive clinical response to percutaneous vertebroplasty. METHODS: A retrospective chart review conducted at our institution yielded 28 vertebroplasty treatment sessions that had been performed after obtaining bone scan imaging for painful, osteoporotic compression fractures in 27 patients. Thirty-five compression fractures were treated during these 28 treatment sessions. In all cases, increased activity was revealed by bone scan imaging before treatment with vertebroplasty. Positive outcome was defined as subjective decrease in pain severity and/or increased level of patient mobility. RESULTS: Subjective pain relief was noted in 26 (93%) of 28 treatment sessions. In 14 (100%) of 14 cases with quantifiable pain levels, pain improved at least 3 points on a 10-point scale (range of improvement, 3-10 points; mean improvement, 7.4 points). Among the remaining 14 treatment sessions in which patients were unable or unwilling to quantify pain severity, the pain relief was described as complete or excellent pain relief in 11 (78%) of 14 cases. In 14 (100%) of 14 cases for which semiquantitative assessment of mobility was available, mobility improved at least one level (5-point graded scale; range of improvement, 1-4 points; mean improvement, 1.7 points).

The mean follow-up was 39 months. The incidence of new fractures after PVP was 27.8%. Low body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD), and vitamin D are factors associated with increased risk of new fractures. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors that could increase the occurrence of new vertebral fractures (VFx) after PVP. METHODS: In our prospective study, we included patients of both sexes with osteoporosis (OP) and at least one painful VFx. We performed a baseline biochemical evaluation (including vitamin D plasma levels) and collected demographic, BMD, and clinical data. One hundred fifteen patients were treated with PVP and assigned to oral bisphosphonates plus Ca and vitamin D. The patients returned to control visits after 1, 3, and 6 months and every 6 months thereafter. X-rays film of the dorsolumbar spine was repeated every 12 months, or in case of pain that would suggest VFx occurrence. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 39 +/- 16 months (range, 15-79). Thirty-two patients (27.8%) had new fragility VFx, all symptomatic. All the fractured patients agreed to undergo a new PVP. We compared the patients who had new VFx to those who had not, and we found significantly lower BMI, total hip, and femoral neck T-scores in the group with new VFx. Furthermore, baseline plasma levels of 25(OH) vitamin D (25(OH)D) were significantly lower in this group. Upon analyzing plasma levels of 25(OH)D 12 months after PVP, we found that a significant difference still persisted: 22 +/- 12 (group with new VFx) vs. 41 +/- 22 ng/ml (group with no VFx; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: We found that in patients with OP treated with PVP, the incidence of new VFx was 27.8% after 39 months; low BMI, BMD, and vitamin D are factors associated with increased risk of new VFx in patients treated with PVP.",eng,1.0

In our department, 22% of kyphoplasties were performed with calcium phosphate cement and the remainder with polymethylmethacrylate. All patients were initially assessed by an interdisciplinary kyphoplasty colloquium, composed of consultants in traumatology, radiology, and endocrinology. Indications included fresh traumatic vertebral fractures; painful sintered osteoporotic vertebrae; osteolysis and painful vertebral body collapse caused by multiple myelomas; and lymphomas and pathological fractures due to metastases of malignant tumors (prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and malignant melanoma) or benign vertebral tumors (hemangioma). Contraindications included patients with instability of the posterior wall and/or pedicles, an infection of the fractured vertebra, a severe hemorrhagic diathesis, known allergies to the cements, pregnancy, and ASA score of 4. The standard postoperative computed tomography scan of the kyphoplasty-treated vertebrae revealed a dorsal cement leakage in 38 vertebrae representing 3.3% of all levels. A permanent monoparesis of the left leg, 2 cases of temporary neurological deficits, 2 cases of hemorrhage, and 1 asymptomatic pulmonary embolism were observed as postoperative complications. We observed no complications relating to polymethylmethacrylate described in the literature.

OBJECTIVE: To compare 4 techniques for vertebral body insufficiency fracture repair by analyzing restoration of height, strength, and stiffness, and quantifying cement leakage. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Current techniques for insufficiency fracture repair, restore prefracture strength, and all potentially have the complication of cement extrusion. To our knowledge, there is no information directly comparing different augmentation techniques. METHODS: There were 4 osteoporotic/osteopenic fresh cadaveric spines' (T6-L5) vertebral bodies divided into the 4 groups and by levels (thoracic, thoracolumbar, lumbar). They were compressed to 25% of their initial height to simulate insufficiency fractures. Fixation techniques were vertebroplasty, osteoplasty (Interpore Cross Int., Irvine, CA), the Cavity Creation System (Synthes, Paoli, PA), and kyphoplasty (Kyphon, Sunnyvale, CA). Fractures were fixed using 3 cc of bone cement and recompressed. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in strength, height restoration, or stiffness among techniques (P < 0.05). Stiffness was significantly different in the lumbar levels between initial and post-fixation measurements (P < 0.05). Cement extrusion of 1 mL was seen in 1 vertebroplasty specimen. CONCLUSIONS: The 4 techniques equally restored strength and stiffness. No difference was seen in height restoration. Cement extrusion was significant in only 1 vertebral body, which may be attributable to the cement quantity.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,J. McCarthy; A. Davis,2016.0,Diagnosis and Management of Vertebral Compression Fractures,", ","Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are the most common complication of osteoporosis, affecting more than 700,000 Americans annually. Fracture risk increases with age, with four in 10 white women older than 50 years experiencing a hip, spine, or vertebral fracture in their lifetime. VCFs can lead to chronic pain, disfigurement, height loss, impaired activities of daily living, increased risk of pressure sores, pneumonia, and psychological distress. Patients with an acute VCF may report abrupt onset of back pain with position changes, coughing, sneezing, or lifting. Physical examination findings are often normal, but can demonstrate kyphosis and midline spine tenderness. More than two-thirds of patients are asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally on plain radiography. Acute VCFs may be treated with analgesics such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, and calcitonin. Physicians must be mindful of medication adverse effects in older patients. Other conservative therapeutic options include limited bed rest, bracing, physical therapy, nerve root blocks, and epidural injections. Percutaneous vertebral augmentation, including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, is controversial, but can be considered in patients with inadequate pain relief with nonsurgical care or when persistent pain substantially affects quality of life. Family physicians can help prevent vertebral fractures through management of risk factors and the treatment of osteoporosis.",eng,0.0

Recent population-based studies using medical billing claims have reported significant reductions in mortality with spinal augmentation compared with conservative therapy, but in nonrandomized settings such as these, there is the potential for selection bias to influence results. OBJECTIVE: To compare major medical outcomes following treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures with spinal augmentation or conservative therapy. Additionally, we evaluate the role of selection bias using preprocedure outcomes and propensity score analysis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort analysis of Medicare claims for the 2002-2006 period. We compared 30-day and 1-year outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed vertebral fractures treated with spinal augmentation (n = 10,541) or conservative therapy (control group, n = 115,851). Outcomes were compared using traditional multivariate analyses adjusted for patient demographics and comorbid conditions. We also used propensity score matching to select 9017 pairs from the initial groups to compare the same outcomes. EXPOSURES: Spinal augmentation (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) or conservative therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality, major complications, and health care utilization. RESULTS: Using traditional covariate adjustments, mortality was significantly lower in the augmented group than among controls (5.2% vs 6.7% at 1 year; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.92). However, patients in the augmented group who had not yet undergone augmentation (preprocedure subgroup) had lower rates of medical complications 30 days post fracture than did controls (6.5% vs 9.5%; odds ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78), suggesting that the augmented group was less medically ill. After propensity score matching to better account for selection bias, 1-year mortality was not significantly different between the groups. Furthermore, 1-year major medical complications were also similar between the groups, and the augmented group had higher rates of health care utilization, including hospital and intensive care unit admissions and discharges to skilled nursing facilities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: After accounting for selection bias, spinal augmentation did not improve mortality or major medical outcomes and was associated with greater health care utilization than conservative therapy. Our results also highlight how analyses of claims-based data that do not adequately account for unrecognized confounding can arrive at misleading conclusions.",eng,1.0

Because there are limited data regarding the survival characteristics of this patient population, we compared the survival of a treated with an untreated vertebral fracture cohort to determine whether vertebroplasty affects mortality rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survival of a treated cohort, comprising 524 vertebroplasty recipients with refractory osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, was compared with a separate historical cohort of 589 subjects with fractures not treated by vertebroplasty who were identified from the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Mortality was compared between cohorts by using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, sex, and Charlson indices of comorbidity. Mortality was also correlated with pre-, peri-, and postprocedural clinical metrics (eg, cement volume use, RDQ score, analog pain scales, frequency of narcotic use, and improvement in mobility) within the treated cohort. RESULTS: Vertebroplasty recipients demonstrated 77% of the survival expected for individuals of similar age, ethnicity, and sex within the US population. Compared with individuals with both symptomatic and asymptomatic untreated vertebral fractures, vertebroplasty recipients retained a 17% greater mortality risk. However, compared with symptomatic untreated vertebral fractures, vertebroplasty recipients had no increased mortality following adjustment for differences in age, sex, and comorbidity (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.82-1.25). In addition, no clinical metrics used to assess the efficacy of vertebroplasty were predictive of survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent was obtained from all patients and all data were handled in a manner consistent with institutional review board guidelines and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Outcomes from 841 vertebroplasties, sorted by operator, were studied; two operators had previous vertebroplasty experience and five were neurointerventionalists who were initially new to the procedure. Objective (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire [RDQ] and analog pain scales) and subjective (mobility, narcotic use) scores were monitored before and after vertebroplasty at specified intervals following treatment. Perioperative cement volume utilization, complications, and number of treated levels were recorded. Random-effects and repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to assess operator differences and variability in clinical outcomes while generalized linear mixed-model regression analyses were used to track changes in clinical outcomes over time. RESULTS: All operators provided similar average durable clinical improvements in postoperative pain and disability with nonsignificant interoperator variability. However, generalized linear model regression suggests that four of five initially novice operators showed significant changes in several procedural measures and clinical outcomes over the study timeframe, including cement volume utilization (reduction of 3.64 to 4.63 cm(3)), 1 week RDQ score (reduction of 4.79 to 8.62 points) and postoperative rest pain (reduction of 1.18 to 2.03 points). CONCLUSION: Changes over time in measured outcomes suggest the presence of a training effect among novice operators.

Accordingly, we sought to characterize the imaging characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes in myeloma patients treated with vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of clinical outcome data from 67 multiple myeloma patients treated with vertebroplasty since October 2000. Quantitative outcome data including the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) and Visual Analog Scales for pain and qualitative outcome data (self-reported pain, mobility, and narcotic use) were collected preoperatively, immediately after vertebroplasty, and at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after treatment. RESULTS: Significant improvements in all of the outcome measures were observed postoperatively and throughout the duration of follow-up. Quantitative outcome measures (RDQ, analog pain scale 0-10, with rest and activity) improved by 11.0 (48%; P < .0001), 2.7 (25%; P < .001), and 5.3 (48%; P < .0001) points, respectively, with persistent improvement at 1 year (P < .01; P < .03; P < .001).

However, it remains debated whether VP or KP results in superior outcomes versus medical management alone in patients experiencing VCFs. PURPOSE: To determine the level of evidence supporting VP or KP for the treatment of VCFs. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients with osteoporotic or tumor-associated VCFs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported and functional measures. METHODS: We reviewed all articles published between 1980 and 2008 reporting outcomes after VP or KP for osteoporotic or tumor-associated VCFs and rated the level of evidence and grades of recommendation (per North American Spine Society [NASS] guidelines) supporting the use of VP or KP for the treatment of VCFs. RESULTS: Seventy-four VP studies for osteoporotic VCF (1 level I, 3 level II, 70 level IV), 35 KP studies for osteoporotic VCF (2 level II, 33 level IV), and 18 VP/KP for tumor VCFs (all level IV) were reviewed. There is good evidence (level I) that VP results in superior pain control within the first 2 weeks of intervention compared with optimal medical management for osteoporotic VCFs. There is fair evidence (level II-III) that VP results in less analgesia use, less disability, and greater improvement in general health when compared with optimal medical management within the first 3 months after intervention. There is fair evidence (level II-III) that by 2 years after intervention, VP provides a similar degree of pain control and physical function as optimal medical management. There is fair evidence (level II-III) that KP results in greater improvement in daily activity, physical function, and pain relief when compared with optimal medical management for osteoporotic VCFs by 6 months after intervention. There is poor-quality evidence that VP or KP results in greater pain relief for tumor-associated VCFs. CONCLUSIONS: Although evidence suggests that physical disability, general health, and pain relief are better with VP and KP than those with medical management within the first 3 months after intervention, high-quality randomized trials with 2-year follow-up are needed to confirm this. Furthermore, the reported incidence of symptomatic procedure-related morbidity for both VP and KP is very low.",eng,0.0

Boorstein,2002.0,Predictive value of intraosseous venography before percutaneous vertebroplasty,", ","PURPOSE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a novel approach for treating patients with painful vertebral body compression fractures. The use of intraosseous venography before the percutaneous injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is not universally accepted. The purpose of this study was to determine if intraosseous venography predicts PMMA flow characteristics when injected into a vertebral body. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-five intraosseous venograms were obtained during 96 vertebroplasty procedures (39 thoracic, 57 lumbar) in 61 patients (49 women, 12 men; age, 36-94 y) over a 32-month period. All venograms were obtained by injecting water-soluble contrast material through the vertebroplasty needle that had been placed percutaneously via a transpedicular approach. The venograms were retrospectively reviewed by the authors and compared in a blinded fashion with the subsequent final vertebroplasty result. RESULTS: Several venographic patterns were observed: bilateral or unilateral marrow blush with or without venous filling, direct venous filling, leakage of contrast material through an endplate or cortical defect, and stasis within the marrow space. Venograms that demonstrated a bilateral marrow blush predicted flow of PMMA across the midline to adequately fill the contralateral hemivertebrae 95% of the time (40 of 42 cases). A unilateral marrow blush predicted the necessity of a second puncture 97% of the time (32 of 33 cases). Intraosseous venography predicted PMMA entering endplate/cortical defects in all cases (22 of 22) and venous structures in 29% (22 of 75) of cases. Direct venous filling was observed during two vertebroplasty procedures and gelatin foam embolization was performed before PMMA instillation. Stasis of contrast material in the marrow space was observed in 15 cases. Overall, in 83% (80 of 96) of the vertebroplasty procedures, intraosseous venography was believed to predict the flow characteristics of PMMA. CONCLUSION: Intraosseous venography provides useful information in predicting PMMA flow characteristics within the vertebral body and in predicting potential undesirable sites of cement deposition, such as through cortical defects and within venous structures.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred patients (79 women, 21 men; mean age, 73.7 y) underwent 156 percutaneous injections of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) into a vertebra (68 thoracic and 88 lumbar) under fluoroscopic guidance over a 35-month period. Before the procedure and at follow-up, patients were asked to quantify their pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) and complete a follow-up questionnaire of our own design. RESULTS: The procedure was technically successful in all patients. There were two complications. One patient sustained a sternal fracture and one experienced a transient radiculopathy. Ninety-seven patients (97%) reported significant pain relief 24 hours after treatment. Mean follow-up duration was 21.5 months (6-44 mo) in 99 patients. Ninety-two patients (93%) reported significant improvement in back pain previously associated with their compression fractures as well as improved ambulatory ability. Before vertebroplasty, the VAS score for the 99 patients was 8.91 +/- 1.12 compared to a score of 2.02 +/- 1.95 at follow-up. The mean difference in VAS scores was significant (P <.0001).

What is the rate of vertebral fractures among patients who have received trimodality therapy (radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery) for locally advanced esophageal cancer? This single-institution, retrospective study attempted to answer this question, focusing on 337 patients who had received trimodality therapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer between 1996 and 2005. Reports of serial radiographs were reviewed to identify vertebral fractures. Duration of follow-up was gathered for all esophageal cancer patients with the intention of calculating fracture incidence rates. Fracture-related symptoms, types of intervention and fracture recurrence were also gleaned from the clinical records. First-time fractures were identified in 47 patients, and 45 of these were new since the cancer diagnosis. Thus, the first-time fracture incidence rate from the time of cancer diagnosis was 12 fractures per 100 patient years. The median time from cancer diagnosis to fracture was 9 months. Fifteen (33%) patients were symptomatic. Acknowledging that a retrospective study can inadvertently result in information omission, we report that pain medications were started in only seven patients (16%), and osteoporosis medication in only six (13%). Two patients were hospitalized, and two underwent vertebroplasty. The median survival after fracture diagnosis was 36 months. This report describes a seemingly high fracture incidence rate that requires confirmation. If confirmed, future studies should focus on identifying risk factors and optimal strategies for the prevention and treatment of vertebral fractures in patients with esophageal cancer.",eng,1.0

METHODS: This was a prospective radiographic study of 50 consecutive patients with 82 VCFs who underwent vertebroplasty at a tertiary referral center. Patients underwent imaging preoperatively with standing lateral and supine cross-table lateral radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Standing lateral radiographs were also obtained postoperatively. Clefts were defined at the time of vertebroplasty as confluent reservoirs for polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Postoperatively, all images were reexamined for the presence and characterization of intravertebral clefts. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 50 patients (48%) had clefted VCFs, and 30 of 82 VCFs (37%) contained clefts. Clefted VCFs were severe, dynamically mobile, and occurred primarily in the thoracolumbar junction. Clefts were detectable by standing lateral radiography in 14%, by supine cross-table radiography in 64%, and by MRI in 96% of fractured vertebrae. Clefts occurred primarily in the anterosuperior portion of the vertebral body, and cleft margins appeared increasingly sclerotic in persistently mobile VCFs. PMMA fill patterns of clefted and unclefted VCFs were distinct. CONCLUSION: Intravertebral clefts occur frequently in osteoporotic VCFs of patients who present for vertebroplasty. The radiographic characteristics of clefts evolve over time and can be indistinguishable from Kummell's disease in severe, persistently mobile, clefted osteoporotic VCFs.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: Illustrate the variability in apparent magnitude of vertebral height restoration when this outcome is reported by four different methods commonly used in the vertebroplasty literature. Propose a consensus method for reporting vertebral height restoration. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Measuring and reporting height restoration of fractured vertebrae presupposes a consensus of method that does not exist. Lack of consensus makes the interpretation of reports and comparison of outcomes of interventions that claim vertebral height restoration difficult. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative standing lateral radiographs of 65 VCFs in 41 patients were compared to assess operative vertebral height restoration. Restorations of vertebral height occurred in 23 instances and were reported by each of the following commonly used methods: (1) absolute restoration in millimeters; (2) percent restoration relative to initial fracture height; (3) percent restoration relative to lost vertebral height; and (4) percent restoration relative to referent vertebral height. RESULTS: Apparent magnitude of height restoration varied nearly four-fold depending on initial fracture severity and reporting method. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial apparent variability in the reported magnitude of identical height restorations demonstrates the need for a consensus method for measuring, reporting, and interpreting this outcome. Rationale is presented to support the recommendation that reports of vertebral height restoration should: include all index vertebral height dimensions (posterior (Hp), middle (Hm) and anterior (Ha) vertebral height); include absolute measurements of all referent vertebral heights; be reported relative to a referent normative height; include a correction for inter-radiographic measurement error; take into consideration the dynamic mobility of some osteoporotic VCFs; and include the calculated precision error for all measurements.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,F. McKiernan; T. Faciszewski; R. Jensen,2004.0,Quality of life following vertebroplasty,", ","BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty may be indicated when a patient with a painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture remains intolerably symptomatic in spite of comprehensive, nonoperative management. Relief of pain and quality of life following percutaneous vertebroplasty, however, remain incompletely defined. We investigated these outcomes with use of a visual analog scale and a validated, osteoporosis-specific health-related quality-of-life instrument. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty. At the time of enrollment, all patients completed the Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire, a validated thirty-item, five-domain, 7-point response-option instrument that measures health-related quality of life in osteoporotic women with back pain due to vertebral compression fracture. At two weeks, two months, and six months postoperatively, all patients completed a validated extraction of the Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire. The minimal, clinically important difference in this 7-point scale is 0.5 unit per question. To assess pain, a visual analog scale (ranging from 1 to 10) was completed preoperatively, one day postoperatively, and at each evaluation thereafter. RESULTS: Forty-six consecutive patients (thirty-two women and fourteen men) underwent forty-nine percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures for the treatment of sixty-six vertebral compression fractures. The mean age of the patients was 74.3 years. The mean fracture age was 2.5 months. The mean pain rating decreased from 7.7 preoperatively to 2.8 one day after the vertebroplasty (p < 0.001), and it remained substantially improved at two weeks, two months, and six months postoperatively (p < 0.001). All five domains of the Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire were improved at two weeks postoperatively and remained improved at each evaluation point through six months (p </= 0.007). Multivariate analysis demonstrated no consistent correlation between postoperative pain relief or any postoperative Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire domain score and gender, smoking history, previous or current steroid use, bone mineral density, dynamic mobility, or the presence of an intravertebral cleft. Immediate postoperative pain relief was weakly and positively associated with age (p < 0.03). Four incident vertebral compression fractures occurred in three (6.5%) of the forty-six patients, and five patients died within six months after the vertebroplasty. No deaths or serious adverse events appeared to be related to vertebroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and substantial relief of pain and improvement in the quality of life are observed following percutaneous vertebroplasty, and these improvements are maintained for at least six months. Percutaneous vertebroplasty can be performed safely in frail, elderly patients, with no apparent increase in the incidence of fractures postoperatively.

Jensen,2005.0,Does vertebral height restoration achieved at vertebroplasty matter?,10.1097/01.rvi.0000163014.71889.16,"PURPOSE: Altered vertebral and spinal configuration after osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is believed to contribute to postfracture morbidity. The objective of this study was to determine whether patients in whom partial vertebral height restoration (VHR) was achieved at percutaneous vertebroplasty had greater pain relief or improved quality of life compared with patients in whom no anatomic restoration was achieved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive subjects undergoing percutaneous vertebroplasty for painful osteoporotic VCFs completed the Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (OQLQ) a validated, disease specific instrument that measures health related quality of life in women with osteoporosis with back pain caused by VCF. At postoperative week 2, month 2, and month 6, all subjects completed the mini-OQLQ, a validated extraction of OQLQ. Pain was rated with a standard visual analogue scale (VAS). Radiographs were manually digitized and evaluated for the presence of dynamic mobility and VHR. The relationship between VHR achieved at percutaneous vertebroplasty and postoperative pain relief and quality of life outcome was examined by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Forty-six subjects (32 women) underwent 49 percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures to treat 66 painful VCFs. Mean patient age was 74.3 years+/-10.9. Mean fracture age was 2.5 months+/-2.1. Pain rating fell from 7.7+/-1.8 to 2.8+/-1.8 within 1 day of percutaneous vertebroplasty and remained improved through month 6 (P<.001). All OQLQ domains improved substantially at week 2 (P<.02) and remained improved through month 6 (P<or=.007). Preoperative dynamic mobility ranged -2.9 to 19.9 mm (average, 5.5 mm). Postoperative VHR in mobile VCFs ranged -2.1 to 9.6 mm (average, 2.9 mm). At all postoperative time points up to 6 months, pain and OQLQ domain scores were similar in patients who achieved partial VHR at percutaneous vertebroplasty compared with those in whom no VHR was achieved. CONCLUSION: Partial vertebral height restoration achieved at percutaneous vertebroplasty did not result in additional pain relief or improved quality of life beyond cement fixation alone.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of 14 patients with 14 painful osteoporotic VCFs who were comfortably confined to the supine position overnight for the purpose of vertebral height restoration. There was sufficient additional vertebral height restoration the following morning to allow percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) in some patients when this had initially been deemed unsafe or technically impossible. Anterior vertebral height of the index VCF was measured from the preoperative standing lateral, immediate cross-table supine lateral, and postconfinement cross-table supine lateral radiographs as well as the first postoperative standing lateral radiograph. Dynamic mobility was defined as the difference in anterior vertebral height between preoperative standing lateral and immediate cross-table supine lateral radiographs. Latent mobility was defined as difference in anterior vertebral height between immediate cross-table supine lateral and postconfinement cross-table supine lateral radiographs. Postoperative vertebral height restoration was defined as the difference in anterior vertebral height between preoperative and first postoperative standing lateral radiographs. Mean patient age was 81.0 years, and mean fracture age was 83.6 days. RESULTS: Dynamic mobility averaged +4.7 mm (range, -2.1 to +12.6 mm; P = .001). Latent mobility averaged +2.7 mm (range, -1.9 to +15.5; P < .02). The average sum of preoperative dynamic and latent mobility (+7.4 mm; range -1.0 to +17.0; P < .001) was not different from final postoperative vertebral height restoration (P > .4). PV was successfully accomplished in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Latent mobility occurs in some VCFs and contributes to vertebral height restoration. Recognition of latent mobility may permit vertebroplasty in some patients in whom the procedure had otherwise been deemed unsafe. Reports of vertebral height restoration following vertebral augmentation should account for that proportion resulting from dynamic and latent mobility.",eng,0.0

Faciszewski,2003.0,The dynamic mobility of vertebral compression fractures,10.1359/jbmr.2003.18.1.24,"We have observed that some osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are mobile. The purpose of this report was to document the existence of dynamic fracture mobility, estimate the frequency of dynamic mobility in patients referred for vertebroplasty, define the magnitude and nature of dynamic mobility, and consider the implications of the dynamic mobility of osteoporotic VCFs. This was a prospective radiographic analysis of 41 consecutive patients with 65 VCFs who underwent vertebroplasty. Preoperative standing lateral radiographs of the fractured vertebrae were compared with supine cross-table lateral radiographs to determine the presence or absence of dynamic mobility. Postoperative standing lateral radiographs were evaluated to document fracture mobility and assess final vertebral height restoration. Radiographs were manually digitized to calculate vertebral body morphometrics. Dynamic fracture mobility was demonstrated in 44% of patients (35% of treated vertebrae) who underwent vertebroplasty. Postoperatively, in mobile fractures, average anterior vertebral height increased 106% compared with initial fracture height (absolute increase, 8.41 +/- 0.4 mm). Mean lateral vertebral area increased from 48% to 80% of normal, and kyphotic angle decreased 40%. Mobile fractures dominated at the thoracolumbar junction. Intravertebral clefts were defined and identified in every mobile fracture and were absent from every nonmobile (fixed) fracture. This radiographic series documents the previously unrecognized occurrence of dynamic fracture mobility in many osteoporotic VCFs. Fracture mobility can be substantial and clinically significant. Any intervention that claims vertebral height restoration must control for the occurrence of dynamic fracture mobility.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To measure motion at the fracture site in an osteoporotic cadaveric sacral insufficiency fracture model before and after fracture creation, after fixation (via 1 of 3 fixation techniques), and after cyclic loading and to compare those values with motion of the intact pelvis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sacral insufficiency fractures occur frequently in the elderly and pose treatment challenges. Screw fixation and sacroplasty have been proposed as possible treatments. There is little information about the stabilization provided by these treatments. METHODS: We potted 18 osteoporotic cadaveric pelves, mounted them on a materials testing machine, measured sacroiliac (SI) joint motion with a vertical load applied to the lumbar spine, and created simulated sacral insufficiency fractures. Then, we measured fracture site motion under load and repaired the fracture using 1 of 3 techniques: a unilateral SI screw, a bilateral SI screw, or sacroplasty. A vertical compressive load (10-350 N) was applied cyclically at 0.5 Hz to the lumbar spine of the repaired specimens for 5000 cycles. Kinematic analysis was conducted prefracture, postfracture, postrepair, and after cyclic loading. RESULTS: Postfracture, there was a significant increase in motion relative to the intact SI joint. After fixation, the average motion in all 3 groups was similar to that of the intact pelvis. After cyclical loading, motion increased in all groups. No significant differences were found between treatments. CONCLUSION: All 3 fixation methods resulted acutely in motion similar to that of the intact pelvis. Although motion increased as a function of cyclical loading, no significant differences were found between fixation methods. All 3 repair methods reduced fracture site motion, but clinical studies are needed to determine if each method relieves pain and provides sufficient fixation for fracture healing.",eng,1.0

The injection of polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) is often a final attempt at therapeutic treatment of complications due to such fractures. Vertebroplasty involves injection of cement via one or both pedicles under high pressure, thus filling and stabilizing the vertebra without reduction of fracture. Extravertebral cement leakage is a common complication: an intact posterior wall normally prevents cement leakage into the epidural space. Kyphoplasty involves transpedicular inflation of balloon tamps, thus creating a cavity which is then filled with PMMA under low pressure. Restoration of vertebral height is possible and the potential for extravertebral cement leakage lessened.",ger,0.0

The result of these VCFs is increased morbidity and mortality in the short and long term. Medical treatment of these fractures includes bed rest, orthotics, analgesic medication and time. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) consists of percutaneous injection of biomaterial, such as methylmethacrylate, into the VCF to produce stability and pain relief. Biomechanical testing has shown that PVP can restore strength and stiffness of the vertebral body to the pre-fracture levels. Clinical results show immediate and maintained pain relief in 70-95% of the patients. Possible major complications include cement leakage into the spinal canal or into the venous system. Additionally, percutaneous vertebroplasty may alter the normal loading behavior of the adjacent vertebral body, and there is an increased risk of adjacent segment VCF. Kyphoplasty is a new technique, which introduces a balloon into the vertebral body transpedicularly to reduce the VCF while creating a cavity for the cement injection. This technique has the benefit of kyphosis reduction as well as less cement leakage. Research continues into the development of injectable biomaterials that are resorbable and allow for new bone formation. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are safe and effective in the treatment of osteoporotic VCFs. They may allow for a faster return to function, and thus avoid the morbidity associated with medical treatment.",eng,0.0

METHODS: We report the case of a 73-year-old male patient presenting with a fresh osteoporotic fracture of L2 and L3 6 weeks after having undergone a dorsal operative stabilization between L3 and L5. RESULTS: Vertebroplasty was performed using a transdiscal descending approach to treat the two adjacent vertebral levels. The patient reported a 50% decrease in pain and was able to walk with a stick at 3 months.

Our study contrasts hospital costs for vertebroplasty versus kyphoplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in routine clinical practice in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 2007-2008 hospital discharge and billing records from the Premier Perspective data base. The primary outcome variable, differences in total hospital cost between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, was assessed by using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Three thousand six hundred seventeen patients received vertebroplasty (64% inpatient, 36% outpatient), and 8118 received kyphoplasty (54% inpatient, 46% outpatient). Approximately 75% were women, and most were white. Mean total unadjusted inpatient costs were $9837 for vertebroplasty versus $13 187 for kyphoplasty (P < .0001). Outpatient vertebroplasty costs were $3319 versus $8100 for kyphoplasty (P < .0001). Lower vertebroplasty costs were largely due to differences in hospital supply and OR. Mean vertebroplasty OR costs were $73.60 (anesthesia), $112.06 (recovery room), and $990.12 (surgery) versus $172.16 (anesthesia), $257.47 (recovery room), and $1,471.49 (surgery) with kyphoplasty. Adjustments for age, sex, admission status, and disease severity accentuated the differences. Mean adjusted inpatient costs were $11 386 for vertebroplasty versus $16 182 for kyphoplasty (P < .0001), and outpatient costs were $2997 for vertebroplasty versus $7010 for kyphoplasty (P < .0001). After adjustments for the same covariates, length-of-stay differences were no longer evident (P = .4945).

Journal Article,"L. J. Melton, 3rd; D. F.

There is considerable debate about which criteria should be used to define a vertebral fracture because there is no consistent relation between symptoms and the degree of vertebral deformity. However, it is the more significant vertebral body deformities that are most closely associated with frequent or severe back pain, and the referrals for vertebral augmentation come mainly from this subset of patients. In addition to their vertebral fractures, these patients typically have osteoporosis or elevated bone turnover, and they are at greatly increased risk of subsequent fractures as a result of falling or, more often, excessive spinal loads from activities of everyday living. Additional risk factors for new vertebral fractures include the number and severity of vertebral deformities at baseline. Moreover, new fractures are most likely in nearby vertebrae, and they occur more frequently in the mid-thoracic or thoracolumbar regions of the spine. Interestingly, these are also the characteristics of the subsequent fractures of contiguous vertebrae considered by some to represent a complication of vertebral augmentation, yet they characterize vertebral fracture risk even in untreated patients. Vertebral fractures are very common among older men and postmenopausal women; they are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality; and they may have a devastating impact on the patient's quality of life. Vertebral augmentation may be able to help many of these patients, although opportunities exist to optimize management strategies with respect to the other factors that influence long-term outcomes in this patient population.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: Should cement augmentation procedures such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty be used in patients with painful compression fractures associated with metastatic spine disease? What is the role of embolization in the treatment of metastatic spine disease? SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebral augmentation is commonly employed in treating osteoporotic fractures and is now increasingly used in the management of pain in patients with spinal tumors. Intra-arterial and transcutaneous embolization techniques are also available in the management of spinal tumors. To date, the effectiveness and safety of these procedures have not been adequately demonstrated. METHODS: A review of the English literature was performed in Pub-Med. One search was performed using the following keywords: cancer, tumor, vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, vertebral augmentation, outcome, safety, pain, and quality of life. A Second search was performed using the keywords: embolization, spinal, and tumors. Original studies reporting on at least 10 patients were included and systematically reviewed. The results were reviewed and discussed through consensus among a multidisciplinary panel of expert members of the Spine Oncology Study Group. Recommendations were made according to the Guyatt Guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 1665 abstracts were identified. Twenty-eight articles using vertebroplasty reported on 877 patients and 1599 treated levels. Medical and neurologic complications varied from 0% to 7.1% and 0% to 8.1%, respectively. Twelve articles using kyphoplasty reported on 333 patients and 481 treated levels. Medical complication rates varied from 0% to 0.5%, without any neurologic complications. Pain and functional outcomes were universally successful using either technique. Ten studies on embolization reported on 330 patients. There were 4 permanent complications (1.4%). Complete or partial embolization was possible in 97.5% with an estimated reduction of intraoperative blood loss of 2.3 L. CONCLUSION: There is strong recommendation and moderate evidence for vertebral augmentation as safe and effective in providing pain relief and improving functional outcome in patients with vertebral body fractures and axial pain due to metastatic disease. There is a strong recommendation and very low evidence for embolization techniques as safe and effective in decreasing intraoperative blood loss in hypervascular tumors.",eng,0.0

Previous studies have shown pain reduction and improvement in functional status after augmentation, but no studies have examined the effect of augmentation on other cancer-related symptoms. We hypothesized that reduction in pain severity would be significantly associated with improvement in other reported symptoms. We retrospectively studied 79 patients who rated pain and symptom severity both before and after kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. Pain was significantly reduced after spinal augmentation (1.3 on a 0 to 10 scale; effect size [ES] = .59; P < .001), as were anxiety (1.3; ES = .47), drowsiness (1.3; ES = .39), fatigue (1.1; ES = .32), depression (.7; ES = .28), and difficulty thinking clearly (.7; ES = .26) (all P < .05). Greater reduction in pain was associated with a greater number of symptoms being reduced. Interestingly, insomnia worsened regardless of any amount of improvement in pain. Because appropriate symptom control contributes to the overall well-being of cancer patients, future studies of pain reduction procedures should include measures of other symptoms to fully characterize the potential benefit of treating pain. PERSPECTIVE: Appropriate symptom control contributes to overall well-being for cancer patients. This study demonstrated that pain reduction after spinal augmentation with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty was positively associated with reduction in other patient-reported cancer-related symptoms. Future studies of these augmentation procedures should measure multiple symptoms, in addition to pain and functional status.",eng,1.0

Both modalities are now recommended by the Durie-Salmon Plus classification although the emphasis is more on MRI than PET/CT. The presence of extra-medullary disease (EMD) as evaluated by PET/CT imaging, initial SUVmax and number of focal lesions (FL) are deemed to be strong prognostic parameters at staging. MRI remains the most sensitive technique for the detection of diffuse bone marrow involvement in both the pre and post-therapy setting. Compression fractures are best characterized with MRI signal changes, for determining vertebroplasty candidates. While PET/CT allows for earlier and more specific evaluation of therapeutic efficacy compared to MRI, when signal abnormalities persist years after treatment. PET/CT interpretation, however, can be challenging in the vertebral column and pelvis as well as in cases with post-therapy changes. Hence, a reading approach combining the high sensitivity of MRI and superior specificity of FDG PET/CT would be preferred to increase the diagnostic accuracy. In summary, the established management methods in MM, mainly relying on biological tumor parameters should be complemented with functional imaging data, both at staging and restaging for optimal management of MM.

The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of vertebroplasty using Cortoss, a recently developed bis-GMA resin. Our newly established vertebroplasty service exclusively uses Cortoss cement and has a patient database which is updated on a regular basis using the medical records. To date, there are 34 patients on this database, mean age 66, in whom a vertebroplasty has been performed on 42 vertebral lesions with a mean of 2.2 ml of Cortoss injected into each lesion. The mean duration of follow up was 9.5 months. Eighty-two per cent of patients reported an improvement in their symptoms, while 79% required less analgesia post vertebroplasty. A total of 88.2% experienced no significant complications. In 38% there was an asymptomatic leakage of Cortoss. Four patients (11.8%) experienced significant complications: one asymptomatic PE, one episode of transient radicular leg pain, one generalized rash and one patient suffered retropulsion of the Cortoss due to further vertebral malignancy. Cortoss vertebroplasty provides comparable efficacy and safety to the published literature for PMMA.",eng,1.0

This study investigated the therapeutic effects of PV on vertebral metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective (2002-2008) review was conducted for 69 consecutive patients with 141 metastatic vertebrae treated with PV using PMMA. The clinical background of the patients, visual analog scale (VAS), improvement rate, outcomes, and complications were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean preoperative VAS score was 7.3 and significantly improved to 1.9 postoperatively (at discharge), with a mean improvement rate of 73.3%. With regard to complications, no new fractures of adjacent vertebral bodies were encountered, but cement leakage was seen in 49% of the patients. Most patients were asymptomatic during the postoperative course, although two patients (3%) experienced dyspnea that was suspected to be adult respiratory distress syndrome or a pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION: PV can offer pain relief to patients with painful vertebral metastases and short life expectancy whose general condition makes surgery difficult.",eng,1.0

Likewise, lumbar spinal stenosis is being treated with less invasive procedures such as interspinous process spacers. The combination of such minimally invasive procedures offers new advantages to selected patients. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of vertebral augmentation combined with interspinous decompression procedure in the same sitting. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: We present 2 cases of elderly females who had lumbar compression fractures with back pain, radicular pain and spinal stenosis. Initially, each was treated with an extension brace. In 1 patient, the brace relieved her back pain, but when she would stand or walk, she had severe pain radiating down her left leg preventing mobilization. The other, who lived by herself, had difficulty putting on her brace and did not wear it consistently. METHODS: On discussion with the patients and their families, the decision was made to proceed with vertebral body augmentation followed by placement of an interspinous process spacer in the same sitting. Both patients had rapid resolution of back and radicular pain. Each has had subsequent compression fractures, but the initially treated levels have remained unchanged. RESULTS: The combination of minimally invasive procedures resulted in rapid pain relief and mobilization in our elderly patients. Although other procedures to decompress the spinal canal, lateral recess and foramen, such as muscle splitting portals with removal of just enough bone to decompress the neural elements, could be advocated, use of an interspinous process spacer achieved the decompression with less dissection, less risk of harm to the thecal sac or nerve roots, minimal blood loss, and operative time. CONCLUSION: Combining vertebral augmentation and placement of an interspinous process spacer represents a viable option for treating such fragile patients.",eng,1.0

Homsi,2014.0,Polymethylmethacrylate pulmonary embolism as a complication of percutaneous vertebroplasty in cancer patients,", ","Percutaneous vertebroplasty is frequently used in the treatment of vertebral body fractures due to osteoporosis, vertebral body metastasis, or myeloma. Acrylic cement of polymethylmethacrylate injected into the vertebral body can leak into the paravertebral venous system and reach the pulmonary artery via the azygos vein leading to a cement pulmonary embolism. We are presenting a case of a 78 year old woman who was found to have polymethylmethacrylate pulmonary embolism as a result of vertebroplasty used for vertebral collapse from metastatic breast cancer. The appearance of new intrapulmonary artery tubular opaque density on CXR performed post procedure is highly suggestive of the diagnosis.

Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a therapeutic, interventional radiologic procedure. The technique consists of the percutaneous puncture of the affected vertebral body, followed by injection of bone cement into a vertebral body for the relief of pain, and the strengthening of the bone. This procedure also carries a risk of complications, and the fracture risk of vertebrae adjacent to cement vertebrae may be increased.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency, causes, and clinical significance of cement leakage into the disc space. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Much has been written about cement leakage into the epidural space following vertebroplasty but only little about intradiscal leakage. METHODS: A total of 66 patients with 1 cemented osteoporotic, fractured vertebra between T5 and L5 were followed for at least 2 years. Two of the senior authors (Y.M. and A.P.) evaluated independently cement leakage into the disc space, possible causes were investigated, and the clinical results were evaluated according to patient self-assessment. RESULTS: Detected in 27 patients, cement leakage into the disc space did not negatively affect patient satisfaction with the procedure. In 7 of these patients, leakage occurred through an intravertebral vacuum cleft and, in 8, through a perforation of the endplate created by the needle tip. In only 2 patients was cement found to cross the height of the vertebral body and leak into the contralateral disc. CONCLUSIONS: Apart from iatrogenic endplate perforation, cement extravasation into the disc space was always found to occur through the fractured endplate or a vacuum cleft. Placing the needle tip far from the fractured endplate and using more solid cement appear to decrease the risk of leakage.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,Y. Mirovsky; Y. Anekstein; E. Shalmon; A.

Until recently, this was considered to be a rare finding that might indicate excessive motion at the fracture site. Our aim in this retrospective study was to determine the occurrence and location of these clefts in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures and evaluate the risk factors involved for developing these clefts in such patients. METHODS: The records of 66 patients with 101 painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures who were treated by vertebroplasty in our department were reviewed. All the fractures with VCs were collected. Age, sex, degree of deformity, and extent of degenerative changes in the adjacent disk space were compared with those found in the patients without clefts. RESULTS: VCs were found in 26 fractured vertebrae of 26 patients. They were significantly more common in elderly men who had deformed fractures located at the thoracolumbar junction, when compared with fractures without clefts, especially when degenerative changes were observed in the adjacent disk space. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that VCs, which have long been considered pathognomonic for avascular necrosis (Kummell disease), are not rare and most probably represent fracture nonunion. Elderly patients who have deformed fractures at the thoracolumbar area have a higher risk for developing clefts, mainly when there is degeneration of the adjacent disk space.",eng,0.0

Traditionally, pain from vertebral compression fractures has been attributed to vertebral body itself. Compression fractures have been shown to increase thoracic kyphosis and thereby increase the thoracic flexion moment; these changes eventually increase the shear stress on the posterior elements. DESIGN: We present a small case series of patients with thoracic compression fractures managed with intra-articular facet injections. SETTING: Tertiary care academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Two patients with thoracic compression fractures. INTERVENTIONS: The subjects received fluoroscopically guided thoracic facet steroid injections for pain management. MAIN OUTCOME: Change in verbal analog pain score. RESULTS: Patients with thoracic compression fractures received significant long-lasting relief after receiving fluoroscopically guided intra-articular injections. CONCLUSION: Facet joints may be abnormally stressed due to the increasing thoracic flexion moment in anterior compression fractures, which may serve as a secondary pain generator; intra-articular facet blocks may be an alternative to vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

This may cause a therapeutic dilemma because these patients often have a very high risk for general anesthesia due to concomitant diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of percutaneous kyphoplasty by using IV anesthesia and sedation with midazolam and piritramide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 2007 to June 2009, we prospectively included 133 patients (77 women, 56 men; mean age, 69.18 +/- 11.45 years) who were referred for BKP. Kyphoplasty was always performed under fluoroscopic guidance with a biplane angiographic system by using a transpedicular or extrapedicular approach. The individual anesthesia risk was assessed by using the ASA criteria. All procedures were performed with the patient under IV anesthesia and sedation with fractionated administration of midazolam and piritramide. Pain was assessed before and after treatment by using a VAS. RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients (74.4%) had a significantly increased risk for general anesthesia (ASA score, >/= 3). A total of 162 kyphoplasty procedures were performed. The mean amounts of midazolam and piritramide used were 11.3 +/- 4.38 mg and 11.8 +/- 3.98 mg, respectively. No complications related to IV anesthesia and sedation occurred. Periprocedural pain management was rated as sufficient, and all patients would undergo the procedure again.

However, symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas can be responsible for spinal cord compression, in which case they constitute a medical emergency, which raises management difficulties in the context of pregnancy. Pregnancy is a known factor responsible for deterioration of these vascular tumors. In this paper, the authors report 2 clinical cases of symptomatic vertebral hemangiomas during pregnancy, including 1 case of spontaneous fracture that has never been previously reported in the literature. The authors then present a brief review of the literature to discuss emergency management of this condition. The first case was a 28-year-old woman at 35 weeks of gestation, who presented with paraparesis. Spinal cord MRI demonstrated a vertebral hemangioma invading the body and posterior arch of T-3 with posterior epidural extension. Laminectomy and vertebroplasty were performed after cesarean section, allowing neurological recovery. The second case involved a 35-year-old woman who presented with spontaneous fracture of T-7 at 36 weeks of gestation, revealing a vertebral hemangioma with no neurological deficit, but it was responsible for pain and local instability. Treatment consisted of postpartum posterior interbody fusion. With a clinical and radiological follow-up of 2 years, no complications and no modification of the hemangiomas were observed. A review of the literature reveals discordant management of these rare cases, which is why the treatment course must be decided by a multidisciplinary team as a function of fetal gestational age and maternal neurological features.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between the percentage of osteoporotic vertebral body volume filled with polymethylmethacrylate cement during percutaneous vertebroplasty and the percentage restoration of strength and stiffness.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A previous biomechanical study reported a weak relationship between the volume of cement injected and restoration of vertebral body strength and stiffness. Vertebral bodies vary considerably in size among regions and among spines, and the weak correlation may be attributed to the fact that the volume of vertebral bodies was not explicitly considered.
METHODS: The volume of 120 vertebral bodies (T6-L5) harvested from 10 osteoporotic female cadaver spines was determined by Archimedean displacement. Compression fractures were experimentally created, and initial strength and stiffness were determined. The vertebral bodies were stabilized using bipedicular injections of 2-8 mL of cement and then recompressed, after which posttreatment strength and stiffness were measured. Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between percentage of volume fill and percentage of restored stiffness and strength.
RESULTS: The correlations between percentage of fill and restored strength and stiffness were weak: r2 = 0.21 and r2 = 0.27, respectively. On average, restoration of strength and stiffness required vertebral body cement fills of 16.2% and 29.8%, respectively.

RESULTS: Lateral and central 3.5-mL injections of cement restored strength, whereas 7.0-mL injections significantly increased strength compared with initial values. The stiffness of vertebral bodies receiving central 3.5-mL injections was significantly less than it was initially, although the stiffness of bodies receiving 3.5-mL laterally was not significantly different from initial values. Initial and posttreatment stiffness values did not significantly differ in vertebral bodies receiving 7.0-mL, lateral or central injections.

Outcomes were assessed preoperatively and at 3 months. RESULTS: In the PVBW defect group, mean pain score decreased from 7.5 to 3.6 (P < 0.001), EQ5D increased from 0.39 to 0.48 and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) decreased from 50 to 42.

Although this is a minimally invasive procedure, complications have been reported. The most important of these is the unintentional migration of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). PURPOSE: The authors present methods, equipment, and principles that minimize occurrence of PMMA migration and other complications. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Patients in a private/university neurosurgery practice were studied retrospectively by chart review. PATIENT SAMPLE: During a 3-year period, 53 levels of vertebroplasty were performed on 35 patients presenting with indications of intractable pain resulting from vertebral body compression fractures. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain assessment and outcome determination were made by the treating physician based on dialog with the patient, examination, and the patient's use of narcotics. The medical records of patients were reviewed for these factors as well as for signs of cerebrospinal fluid leak, PMMA migration, new radiculopathy, myelopathy, new fracture, pulmonary emboli, infection, or bleeding. METHODS: Criteria for inclusion consisted of disabling back pain corresponding to a recent fracture, pharmacotherapy, and medically stable for anesthesia. Vertebroplasty patients were followed up at 2 to 3 weeks and at 3 months after their procedure. RESULTS: Success rate for relief of pain was 89%. The overall complication rate was 6% per treated vertebral level. There were no deaths or delayed complications. Factors that reduce complications were identified and include the following: accurate needle placement, adequate barium radio-opacification of PMMA, viscous low pressure delivery of PMMA, and PMMA delivery under direct fluoroscopic visualization.

Sawada,2006.0,[Basic experimental study of intraosseous venography using carbon dioxide contrast agent in percutaneous vertebroplasty],", ","PURPOSE: In percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), intraosseous venography is performed using water-soluble ionic iodinated contrast media (iodine contrast media) before injecting bone cement. However, because of contrast medium remaining in the fractured cleft, we experienced the persistence of intravertebral opacification that obscured visualization of the cement under X-ray fluoroscopy. To solve this problem, we examined carbon dioxide (CO(2)) as a contrast medium. METHODS: We measured the contrast of iodine contrast media and CO(2) and performed a subjective assessment of imaging by enforcing intraosseous venography by changing the tube voltage and image intensifier (I.I.) entrance dose in a bone sample of a cadaver using iodine contrast media and CO(2). In vivo study, we performed a subjective assessment of images obtained by intraosseous venography using CO(2) under two kinds of X-ray views. RESULTS: We determined that the contrast of CO(2) is 1/6-1/7.5 that of iodine contrast media, and that CO(2) fluctuates less in its contrast value with changes in tube voltage. In our assessment of the image of the bone sample, CO(2) performed worse that iodine contrast media. However, if the I.I. entrance dose is kept above 2.5 microGy/F, CO(2) is considered to be of clinical use. In the clinical image assessment, the best conditions were an image collection rate of 7.5 F/S and matrix of 1024 x 1024.

Bone density testing and medical treatment with bisphosphonates or parathormone are recommended for all patients with an osteoporotic fracture diagnosis. Inadequate testing and treatment of patients presenting with low-impact fractures have been reported in various specialties. Similar data are not available from academic neurosurgery groups. The authors assessed compliance with treatment and testing of osteoporosis in patients with vertebral compression fractures evaluated by the authors' academic neurosurgery service, and patient variable and health-systems factors associated with improved compliance. METHODS Data for patients who underwent percutaneous kyphoplasty for compression fractures was retrospectively collected. Diagnostic and medical interventions were tabulated. Pre-, intra-, and posthospital factors that had been theorized to affect the compliance of patients with osteoporosis-related therapies were tabulated and statistically analyzed. RESULTS Less than 50% of patients with kyphoplasty received such therapies. Age was not found to correlate with other variables. Referral from a specialist rather than a primary care physician was associated with a higher rate of bone density screening, as well as vitamin D and calcium therapy, but not bisphosphonate/parathormone therapy. Patients who underwent preoperative evaluation by their primary care physician were significantly more likely to receive bisphosphonates compared with those only evaluated by a hospitalist. Patients with unprovoked fractures were more likely to undergo multiple surgeries compared with those with minor trauma. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest poor compliance with current standard of care for medical therapies in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures undergoing kyphoplasty under the care of an academic neurosurgery service.",eng,0.0

Carrino,2007.0,"Vertebroplasty in the United States: guidance method and provider distribution, 2001-2003",10.1148/radiol.2431060045,"PURPOSE: To use the nationwide Medicare database to retrospectively evaluate the provider distribution for vertebroplasty, as well as the guidance method used in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Use of the Medicare database was exempt from Institutional Review Board review and informed consent; regarding HIPAA compliance, the Medicare database lacks unique patient identifiers. Using the 2001, 2002, and 2003 United States Medicare part B claims database, the authors studied CPT-4 (Current Procedural Terminology, fourth edition) procedure codes used for vertebroplasty procedures, including thoracic and lumbar vertebroplasty (22520 and 22521, respectively), treatment of additional levels (22522), and method of radiologic guidance (fluoroscopy, 76012; CT, 76013). For each of these codes, volume and physician specialty participation were tabulated. RESULTS: In 2001, 14 152 vertebroplasty procedures were reimbursed through Medicare. In 2003, the volume increased to 24 558 (+73.5%). In 2001 radiologists performed the majority (9864, 69.7%) of these procedures. The minority were performed by other specialists, mainly orthopedic surgeons (1792, 12.7%), neurosurgeons (1037, 7.3%) and anesthesiologists (736, 5.2%). In 2003, radiologists performed 86.8% more vertebroplasties than in 2001, and participation increased to 75.0% of the total. Radiologists had the greatest increase of all specialties from 2001 to 2003 (+86.8% vs: orthopedic surgery, +58.3%; neurosurgery, +55.7%; other, +46.6%; physiatry, +32.1%; neurology, +15.5%; anesthesiology, -11.8%). From 2001 to 2003, the number of additional levels treated by each of the three highest-volume specialties decreased (radiology, 23.0% to 20.8%; orthopedic surgery, 36.3% to 27.5%; neurosurgery, 28.2% to 27.0%). As a guidance method, fluoroscopy is used almost exclusively (98.7% in 2003). CONCLUSION: Radiologists performed the majority of Medicare-reimbursed vertebroplasty procedures in the United States in 2001-2003. Fluoroscopy is nearly universal as a guidance method.",eng,0.0

Laufer,2015.0,Short-segment percutaneous pedicle screw fixation with cement augmentation for tumor-induced spinal instability,10.1016/j.spinee.2015.03.037,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Pathologic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) represent a major source of morbidity and diminished quality of life in the spinal oncology population. Procedures with low morbidity that effectively treat patients with pathologic fractures are especially important in the cancer population where life expectancy is limited. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are often not effective for mechanically unstable pathologic fractures extending into the pedicle and facet joints. Combination of cement augmentation and percutaneous instrumented stabilization represents a minimally invasive treatment option that does not delay radiation and systemic therapy. PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cement-augmented short-segment percutaneous posterolateral instrumentation for tumor-associated VCF with pedicle and joint involvement. METHODS: Forty-four consecutive patients underwent cement-augmented percutaneous spinal fixation for unstable tumors between 2011 and 2014. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, including visual analog pain scale (VAS) response score and procedural complications, was performed. RESULTS: Patients with a median composite Spinal Instability Neoplastic Scale score of 10 (range=8-15) were treated with constructs spanning one to four disk spaces (median of two spaces, constituting 84% of all cases). The proportion of patients with severe pain decreased from 86% preoperatively to 0%; 65% of patients reported no referable instability pain postoperatively. There was one adjacent-level fracture responsive to kyphoplasty, and one case of asymptomatic screw pullout. Two patients subsequently required decompression in the setting of disease progression despite radiation; there was no perioperative morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous cement-augmented posterolateral spinal fixation is a safe and effective option for palliation of appropriately selected mechanically unstable VCF that extends into pedicle and/or joint.",eng,1.0

PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective nonrandomized comparative study was to analyze the incidence and possible risk factors of adjacent level fracture comparing BK with conservative therapy. METHODS: Consecutive patients satisfying the inclusion criteria of acute vertebral fracture pain (occurring within 1-6 weeks of the event and not relieved by oral analgesia) and imaging criteria of acute fracture activity were enrolled. All patients meeting the inclusion criteria were offered BK. The patients who declined BK and agreed to longitudinal evaluation were treated conservatively and constituted the control group. RESULTS: In 3 out of 46 patients (6.5 %) treated with BK and in 10 out of 61 patients treated conservatively (16.4 %), the adjacent level fracture occurred within 1 year. The degree of local kyphosis and bone mineral density (BMD) were identified as important predictive factors for adjacent level fracture. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that BK carries a low risk of adjacent level fractures. Lower BMD values and altered biomechanics in the treated area of the spine due to resistant kyphosis are possible predictive factors for adjacent level fractures. A positive effect of BK over conventional treatment was observed upon reduction of the incidence of adjacent level fracture, vertebral morphology, and pain reduction.",eng,0.0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adjacent level fracture risk after BK as compared with VP and to determine the possible dominant risk factor associated with new compression fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 73 consecutive patients with painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) were enrolled in a prospective nonrandomized study. BK was performed in 46 patients (51 vertebral bodies) and VP in 27 patients (32 vertebral bodies). The first patient's visit was before the operative procedure, when clinical and radiographical examinations were done. The follow-up visits, considered in the analysis, were on the first day and after 1 year, postoperatively. RESULTS: In 1 year, 3 out of 46 patients (6.5%) treated with BK, and 2 out of 27 patients (7.4%) treated with VP sustained adjacent level fracture. More patients with a BMD higher or equal to 3.0 experienced a new fracture than those with a BMD less than 3.0 (odds ratio = 13.00; 95% confidence interval: 1.35-124.81), and the risk for adjacent level fractures decreased significantly when the postoperative kyphotic angle was less than 9 degrees compared with that of higher or equal to 9 degrees (odds ratio = 12.00; 95% confidence interval: 1.25-114.88). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that BK and VP are methods with a low risk of adjacent level fractures. The most important factors for new VCFs after a percutaneous augmentation procedure are the degree of osteoporosis and altered biomechanics in the treated area of the spine due to resistant kyphosis. These results suggest that the adjacent vertebrae would fracture eventually, even without the procedure. BK and VP offer a comparable rate of pain relief.",eng,0.0

Cost-effective treatment is thus all the more important. In this study, we evaluated patients' quality of life during the first 12 months after they had undergone percutaneous vertebroplasty for vertebral body fractures which were refractory to conservative treatment. Our analysis took the causes of the fractures into account. METHODS: Pain, mobility, and need for analgesics were assessed prospectively on verbal rating scales one day before and one day after vertebroplasty, as well as over a follow-up period of up to 12 months. The same examiner interviewed each patient at all time points to obtain this information. RESULTS: 1188 patients underwent vertebroplasty for 1980 vertebral body fractures; the most common etiology was osteoporosis (75%). There was statistically relevant improvement in all three of the variables studied from the day before the procedure to the last follow-up, regardless of the cause of fracture (p<0.01). Most of the clinical benefit was already evident on the day after the procedure. Patients with fractures due to osteoporosis experienced further statistically relevant improvement by 6 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty immediately relieves the pain of vertebral body fractures, improves patients' mobility, and lowers their consumption of analgesics. There can be further clinical improvement up to 6 months after the procedure, particularly in patients with fractures due to osteoporosis. As osteoporosis is the most common cause of vertebral body fractures, this patient group is important not just clinically, but economically as well.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the radiation exposure to the surgeon and to the patient during kyphoplasty, and also to provide a procedural algorithm that effectively minimizes the radiation exposure to the surgeon during any fluoroscopic-guided procedure. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spine surgeons who perform minimally invasive procedures often employ fluoroscopy for intraoperative navigation. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. Two fluoroscopes (1 anterior/posterior and 1 lateral) were used for localization, navigation, and monitoring cement flow. All surgeons wore thyroid shields and lead aprons. The dose of radiation exposure was measured by dosimeter badges. One badge was attached to each patient. The surgeons wore 3 badges: under the thyroid shield (protected), under the lead apron over the left chest (protected), and outside the lead apron over the left chest (unprotected). A thermoluminescent ring dosimeter was worn on the right hand for 18 cases, and on the left hand for 9 cases. RESULTS: The exposure time was 5.7+/-2.0 minutes/vertebra for a single level (n=10), 3.9+/-0.8 minutes/vertebra for a 2 level (n=9), 2.9+/-1.2 minutes/vertebra for a 3 level kypholasty (n=8). The exposure time of single level kyphoplasy was significantly different from that of multilevel kyphoplasy (2 level, P=0.040; 3 level, P=0.002). Surgeon exposure as measured by the protected dosimeter was less than the minimum reportable dose (<0.010 mSv). Exposure as measured by the unprotected dosimeter, which is equivalent to deep whole body exposure was 0.248+/-0.170 mSv/vertebra. The eye exposure was 0.271+/-0.200 mSv/vertebra, and the shallow exposure (hand/skin) was 0.273+/-0.200 mSv/vertebra. The hand exposure was 1.744+/-1.173 mSv/vertebra. CONCLUSIONS: Without eye or hand protection, the total radiation exposure dose to these areas would exceed the occupational exposure limit after 300 cases per year. Surgeons should wear lead lined glasses and keep their hands out of the radiation beam.",eng,0.0

The risk of subsequent fracture was significantly greater among treatment patients, especially within 90 days of the procedure. INTRODUCTION: Predominantly uncontrolled studies suggest a greater risk of subsequent vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) associated with vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty. To further understand this risk, we conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using data from a large regional health insurer. METHODS: Administrative claims procedure codes were used to identify patients receiving either a vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty (treatment group) and a comparison group of patients with a primary diagnosis of VCF who did not receive treatment during the same time period. The main outcomes of interest, validated by two independent medical record reviewers, were any new VCFs within (1) 90 days, (2) 360 days, and (3) at adjacent vertebral levels. Multivariable logistic regression examined the association of vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty with new VCFs. RESULTS: Among 48 treatment (51% vertebroplasty, 49% kyphoplasty) and 164 comparison patients, treated patients had a significantly greater risk of secondary VCFs than comparison patients for fractures within 90 days of the procedure or comparison group time point [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 6.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-26.9] and within 360 days (adjusted OR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.1-7.9).

Journal Article,C. W. Mueller; U. Berlemann,2005.0,Kyphoplasty: chances and limits,", ","Kyphoplasty provides a minimal-invasive surgical technique for the cement augmentation of vertebral bodies following osteoprotic compression fractures or malignant processes. Kyphoplasty has been developed as an advancement of vertebroplasty. Both procedures feature high-success rates in terms of reliable and lasting reduction of pain. Advantages of kyphoplasty over vertebroplasty are to be seen in the possibility of deformity correction as well as in a decreased risk of cement leakage, which represents the most important source for clinical complications. Long-term experiences with the effect of cementing vertebral bodies are sparse. Thus indications and possibilities have to be judged realistically. Conditions, which have to be considered before performing kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty include age of the patient, age of the fracture, degree of deformation and additional degenerative changes of the spine.

In the following, we present the case of a 73-year-old female who sustained a compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra (L1) in a motor vehicle accident. The fracture was treated by kyphoplasty using PMMA cement. Three weeks after hospital discharge the patient was presented with increasing back pain. In imaging, dislocation of the PMMA cement could be shown combined with a total collapse of the L1 vertebra. The resulting significant kyphosis was first reduced by dorsal transpedicular (Th12-L2) internal fixation and stabilized by an anterior cage after total removal of the cement plomb and some remaining bone of the L1 vertebra. Bacterial as well as histological examination of the cement and bone led to the diagnosis of aseptic osteonecrosis. Different underlying events could be discussed. We think it most likely that the osteoporotic bone was unable to interface sufficiently with the PMMA cement and, therefore, disintegrated under loading. Furthermore, the volume of injected cement could have significantly compromised the blood supply within the bone.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of unsuspected malignancy in bone biopsies of patients undergoing PVP for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Most vertebral compression fractures, which result from minimal, or no trauma have osteoporosis as underlying cause. The diagnosis osteoporosis is based on clinical and radiologic findings. Even in patients with proven osteoporosis it is not always the true cause of the fractures. In literature, outcomes of bone-biopsies obtained during vertebroplasty have been described with inconsistent percentages of unexpected malignancy. METHODS: To determine the rate of unsuspected malignancy, 78 biopsies were obtained from 78 patients (18 male; 60 female; mean age, 73 years). The histologic diagnoses of vertebral body biopsy specimens were analyzed in a retrospective study. RESULTS: Seventy-one biopsies (91%) obtained from 71 patients, were suitable for histologic evaluation. Seven biopsies (9.0%) could not be interpreted as a result of suboptimal quality biopsy material. The population included 10 patients (13%) with a history of malignancy, in this group no malignancy was found in the bone biopsies. In 3 patients (3.8% of all biopsies) previously undiagnosed malignancies, 2 multiple myeloma stage IIa and 1 chondrosarcoma grade I, were found. CONCLUSION: Obtaining bone biopsies during PVPs does not lead to increased morbidity and can verify the pathologic process underlying the vertebral compression fractures. Since this study showed an unsuspected malignancy rate of 3.8%, we recommend routine obtainment of a vertebral body bone biopsy, preferably using a biopsy needle with a diameter larger than 14 Gauge (>2.1 mm/0.083 inch), during every PVP procedure.",eng,1.0

In three patients there was another indication. A 44-year-old woman suffering from vertebral pain due to an osteolytic lesion caused by multiple myeloma was treated with vertebroplasty of 4 vertebral levels. A 60-year-old woman with progressive complaints of back pain due to an aggressive vertebral haemangioma was treated with vertebroplasty after embolisation had only been partially successful. Lastly, a 50-year-old non-osteoporotic man with back pain persisting for six weeks due to a stable traumatic burst fracture of TIX could not be treated with standard care, i.e. corset and analgesics, because of obesity. He was treated with PVP after a cavity had been created in the vertebral corpus. Vertebroplasty is a minimal invasive procedure resulting in most patients in rapid diminishment of the pain caused by pathological vertebral fractures, which may be present for a longer period and may have different causes. The indication triad for vertebroplasty consists of localised back pain, pain when pressure is applied to the processus spinosus of the fractured level and MRI bone oedema, findings suggestive of microfractures in a pathologically changed vertebral body.

We also examined the quality of life (QoL). The clinical follow-up involved the use of a pain intensity numerical rating scale (PI-NRS, 0 to 10), the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) QoL questionnaire and an anamnestic questionnaire before and at seven days (PI-NRS only), and one, three, 12 and 36 months post-operatively.

METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on a cohort of consecutive patients undergoing vertebroplasty over a 5-year period between April 2006 and March 2011 at the Royal London Hospital. Polymethylmethacrylate cement injection was used in every procedure. Intraoperative vertebral body biopsy was performed routinely at every level of VCF. Pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, analgesic usage, and complications were recorded preoperatively and at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 202 levels were augmented in 147 patients. The most common levels augmented were T-12 (17%), L-1 (18%), and L-4 (10%). Analysis of 184 routine vertebral biopsies in 135 patients revealed that in 86 patients with presumed osteoporosis and no prior cancer diagnosis, 4 (4.7%) had a malignant VCF. In 20 known cancer patients presumed to be in remission, 2 (10%) had a malignant VCF. Routine vertebral biopsy returned an overall cancer diagnosis rate of 5.5% (6 of 109) when combining the 2 groups (patients with no prior history of cancer or cancer thought to be in remission). In these 6 patients, history, examination, laboratory tests, and preprocedure imaging all failed to suggest malignancy diagnosed at routine biopsy. Significant reductions in pain VAS and ODI scores were evident at Day 1 and were sustained at up to 1 year postoperatively (p < 0.001). They were not dependent on the level of fracture (T3-10, T11-L2, or L3-S1) (p > 0.05), number of levels treated (single level, 2 levels, or > 2 levels) (p > 0.05), or etiology of VCF (p > 0.05). The complication rate was 6% (9 of 147). There were 5 deaths, none of which were directly related to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Routine vertebral biopsy performed at vertebroplasty may demonstrate cancer-related VCFs in unsuspected patients with no previous cancer diagnosis or active malignancy in patients previously thought to be in remission. This early diagnosis of cancer or relapsed disease will play an important role in expediting patients' subsequent cancer management. In cases of multiple-level VCF, the authors advocate biopsy at each level to maximize the diagnostic yield from the specimens and to avoid missing a malignancy at a single level.",eng,1.0

Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty vs conservative treatment],10.1007/s00132-009-1576-6,"Vertebral compression fractures are among the most common forms of manifestations of osteoporosis. Conservative treatment comprises adequate analgesia, osteoporosis medication and individualized physiotherapy or braces. Nevertheless, vertebral compression fractures frequently lead to persisting pain and decrease daily activity and quality of life. In these cases, kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty can be efficient treatment options. Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive procedure, in which bone cement is filled into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic control. In most cases, this internal stabilization leads to a rapid reduction in pain. Kyphoplasty additionally aims to correct the kyphotic deformation of the broken vertebra via introducing and inflating a balloon catheter. There is broad clinical experience with both procedures. For kyphoplasty, randomized controlled trials showed significant improvements in pain and quality of life in patients undergoing kyphoplasty. However, cement leakages lead to rare but severe complications such as pulmonary embolism and nerve palsies.",ger,0.0

Archimedes taught us that a volume displaces its volume. Where does the tumor we displace with our cement injection go? It is no longer acceptable that we displace tumor into the venous system with our cement injections. We must kill the tumor first. Different image-guided percutaneous techniques can be used for treatment in patients with primary or secondary bone tumors. Curative ablation can be applied for the treatment of specific benign or in selected cases of malignant localized spinal tumors. Pain palliation therapy of primary and secondary bone tumors can be achieved with safe, fast, effective, and tolerable percutaneous methods. Ablation (chemical, thermal, mechanical), cavitation (radiofrequency ionization), and consolidation (cementoplasty) techniques can be used separately or in combination. Each technique has its indications, with both advantages and drawbacks. To prevent pathological fractures, a consolidation is necessary. In spinal or acetabular tumors, a percutaneous cementoplasty should be associated with cryoablation to avoid a compression fracture. The cement is injected after complete thawing of the ice ball or the day after the cryotherapy.

Twenty patients (16 women, four men, mean age 71 years): four with traumatic vertebral fracture (Magerl A1 fractures) and 16 with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (VCFs) resistant to conservative therapy, were treated by vertebral body stenting system (VBS) as follows: two at level T11, four at T12, one at L1, two at L2, five at L3 and six at L4. All patients were studied by MR (protocol: sagittal T1W, T2W and T2 STIR) and MDCT with MPR reconstructions. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia with fluoroscopy guidance and a bipeduncular approach. VBS, a new system of implantation of endovertebral stent used as an alternative to conventional vertebroplasty (VP), was implanted in all patients to restore the loss of height in the fractured vertebral body. A clinical and x-ray follow-up was performed at six and 12 months evaluating the result by VAS and ODS scale. New vertebral fractures at a distant level were observed in two cases and treated by VP. VBS was successful and led to an excellent outcome in all patients with clinical improvement stable at six months and one year follow-up. The height in the fractured vertebral body was increased in 12 of the 20 VCFs by an average of 1.5 mm. No vascular, extraforaminal or epidural leakage or other adverse events were observed. In the clinical 12 months follow-up we recorded a reduction of four scores in the VAS evaluation and a 40% reduction in the ODS score compared with the pre-treatment values. Endovertebral stents were stable at 12 months at x-ray control in 19/20 patients. No new vertebral fracture located in adjacent vertebrae were observed at 12 month follow-up. By using a stent, the VBS system reduces the collapsed vertebral body and offers good height restoration. The mechanical scaffold of the stent restores the height and at the same time offers a cavity for injection of highly viscous PMMA bone cement without increasing the rate of new vertebral fracture post-VP. A long-term follow-up is recommended.",eng,0.0

Reduction of the vertebral body kyphotic deformity, considering the target of normal spine biomechanics, could improve all systemic potential complications evident in patient with vertebral compression fracture (VCF). Main indications for AT are related to fractures in fragile vertebral osseous matrix and non-osteoporotic vertebral lesions due to spine metastasis or trauma.

Di Furia,2005.0,Vertebroplasty in the treatment of back pain,", ","PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to show the utility of vertebroplasty in the treatment of some types of back pain. Vertebroplasty is a venous embolisation of the vertebral body performed under computed tomography (CT) or fluoroscopy guidance with transpedicular, anterolateral, intercostovertebral or posterolateral approach with acrylic cement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report our experience in 85 patients suffering from low back and thoracic pain and treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty owing to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, vertebral haemangiomas or secondary lytic lesions of the spine. Patient selection was performed on the basis of physical examination, magnetic resonance or less frequently, with bone scan. CT has a minor role in selected cases to evaluate the integrity of the posterior wall. We treated 55 patients affected by acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, 10 patients with vertebral haemangioma and 20 patients with metastatic lesions. The patients were placed in the prone position and the procedure was performed under fluoroscopy guidance in 80 patients and under CT guidance in 5 patients affected by metastatic lesions. In no cases was phlebography performed before the treatment. The approach adopted was bilateral in 45 patients and unilateral in the remaining 30 cases. Injection with a low viscosity cement was performed under fluoroscopy guidance with extreme precision in all cases. The amount of cement injected ranged from 4 ml (thoracic level) up to 12 ml (lumbar level). RESULTS: The results were better for osteoporotic cases (95%) and patients with vertebral haemangioma (90%) than with metastatic lesions (77%), with improvement within 24-72 hours after the treatment. We noted asymptomatic cement leakage in 39 cases but only in 2 cases was there an acute radiculopathy due to epidural cement leakage, which was treated and resolved medically in 1 month. At follow-up no cases were noted of fractures of vertebral bodies adjacent to the treated vertebrae. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Since the first case of vertebroplasty was used in vertebral haemangioma, the possibility of using this technique in other pathological conditions such as metastatic lesions and osteoporotic compression fractures has been clear. MR has a key role in the selection of patients while bone scan and CT can be useful in selected cases. Absolute controindication is local or systemic infection while relative controindications are epidural extension of the neoplastic lesion, vertebra plana, clinical signs of myelopathy or radiculopathy and coagulation disorders. The results of our study were better in patients treated for osteoporosis or haemangioma than in cancer patients. We consider percutaneous vertebroplasty a valid technique for the treatment of the pain due to osteoporotic compression fractures, vertebral haemangiomas or metastatic lesions.","eng

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vertebroplasty was performed on 805 vertebral bodies in 485 patients affected by osteoporosis (310), metastasis (160) and vertebral haemangioma (15). The approach was unipedicular in 365 patients and bipedicular in 120 patients. Biopsies were obtained in patients with no known primary cancer (75). Kyphoplasty was performed in 39 patients with Magerl type A1 and A3 fractures within 3 months from the trauma. A bipedicular approach was used in all cases. RESULTS: Outcomes were assessed on the basis of the visual analogue scale and the Oswestry Disability Index. In patients treated with vertebroplasty, success rates at 24-72 h were 90% for osteoporotic fractures, 100% for vertebral haemangiomas and 77% for metastatic fractures. Extravertebral vascular or discal leakage of cement occurred in 39 patients, but only two of them reported radicular pain due to epidural involvement. Osteoporotic patients developed new vertebral fractures at adjacent levels in 25 cases and at distal levels in 19 cases. In patients treated with kyphoplasty, pain relief was achieved within one month after treatment in 90% of cases. None of the patients wore orthotic braces after treatment, and no vertebral collapse was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are both useful in the management of vertebral pain. In light of our experience, vertebroplasty is better indicated for vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis, haemangioma or metastasis on account of its simplicity and minimal invasiveness. Kyphoplasty is suggested in acute traumatic fractures of type A1 and A3 according to Magerl, as it allows recovery of vertebral stability and a better distribution of the cement.","eng

Short-term complications such as cement leak and embolism are well described. Incident fractures are the only well-reported long-term complications. The authors describe the cases of 5 patients who presented with back pain caused by instability or worsening neurological status 13 months (range 8-17 months) after vertebroplasty. They further classify this postvertebroplasty instability into intervertebral instability and intravertebral instability, depending on the apex of abnormal mobility. One patient presented with cement migration and progressive collapse of the augmented vertebral body. Another patient presented with an additional fracture. Both cases were classified as intravertebral instability. The cases of 3 other patients presenting with adjacent endplate erosion, vacuum disc phenomenon, and bridging osteophyte formation were classified as having intervertebral instability. Long-term effect of cements on the augmented vertebral body and adjacent endplates and discs is a cause for concern. Vertebroplasty acts as a mechanical stabilizer and provides structural support but does not bring about union. Micromotion has been shown to persist for years after vertebroplasty. This study describes persistent instability after vertebroplasty in a series of 5 cases. The authors propose that postvertebroplasty instability occurs due to collapse of soft osteoporotic bone and endplates around cement. All 3 cases of intervertebral instability were associated with an intradiscal cement leak. With increased longevity and higher functional demands of the geriatric population, the durability of this rock (cement) between cushions (of osteoporotic bone)"" arrangement (as seen in vertebroplasty) will be increasingly challenged.""",eng,1.0

Dreher,2015.0,Vertebroplasty increases trabecular microfractures in elderly female cadaver spines,10.1007/s00198-015-3105-2,"UNLABELLED: This study assessed whether vertebroplasty increases trabecular bone microfractures in adjacent vertebrae of elderly female cadavers. Results indicated microfractures were almost two times greater in superior adjacent vertebrae for vertebroplasty treated spines compared to non-treated controls. This finding may aid in developing improved treatments for osteoporotic women with vertebral fractures. INTRODUCTION: Although vertebroplasty may stabilize compression fractures and reduce pain, subsequent vertebral fractures occur in approximately 25 % of patients, reducing the overall safety of this procedure. This is particularly a concern in vertebrae surrounding the treated level where bone cement may cause abnormal transfer of forces to adjacent spinal structures. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the effects of vertebroplasty on local trabecular bone damage in adjacent vertebrae. METHODS: Five level motion segments (T11-L3) from osteopenic/osteoporotic female cadaver spines (T-score -2.9 +/- 1.0) were assigned into either vertebroplasty or control (no vertebroplasty) groups (n = 10/group) such that T-score, trabecular microarchitecture, and age were similar between groups. Compression fractures were created in the L 1 vertebra of all specimens and PMMA bone cement was injected into the fractured vertebra of vertebroplasty specimens. All spine segments were subjected to cyclic axial compression (685-1370 N) for 115,000 cycles. Post-testing, trabecular cubes were cut from adjacent (T12 and L2) vertebral bodies and histologically processed. Trabecular microfractures were identified and normalized by bone area in each section. RESULTS: There were significantly more trabecular microfractures (p < 0.001) in superior adjacent vertebral bodies of the vertebroplasty group (0.091 +/- 0.025 microfractures/mm(2)) when compared to the control group (0.049 +/- 0.018 microfractures/mm(2)). However, there was no difference in trabecular microfractures (p = 0.835) between vertebroplasty (0.045 +/- 0.022 microfractures/mm(2)) and control groups (0.035 +/- 0.013 microfractures/mm(2)) for inferior adjacent vertebral bodies. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty specifically impacts the superior adjacent vertebrae of elderly female spines resulting in almost two times more trabecular microfractures when compared to non-treated controls.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Vertebral compression fractures were created in female cadaveric (age range 51-88 years) thoracolumbar spine segments. Specimens were placed into either the control or vertebroplasty group (n = 9/group) such that bone mineral density, trabecular microarchitecture, and age were statistically similar between groups. For the vertebroplasty group, polymethylmethacrylate bone cement was injected into the fractured vertebral body under fluoroscopy. Cyclic compression (685-1370 N sinusoid) was performed on all spine segments for 115,000 cycles. Micro-CT scans were obtained before and after cyclic loading to quantify endplate subsidence. Maximum subsidence was compared between groups in the caudal endplate of the superior adjacent vertebra (SVcau); cranial (TVcra) and caudal (TVcau) endplates of the treated vertebra; and the cranial endplate of the inferior adjacent vertebra (IVcra). In addition, micro-CT images were used to quantify average endplate thickness and trabecular bone volume fraction. These parameters were then correlated with maximum endplate subsidence for each endplate. RESULTS: The maximum subsidence in SVcau endplate for the vertebroplasty group (0.34 +/- 0.58 mm) was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than for the control group (-0.13 +/- 0.27 mm). Maximum subsidence in the TVcra, TVcau, and IVcra endplates were greater in the vertebroplasty group, but these differences were not significant (p > 0.16). Increased subsidence in the vertebroplasty group manifested locally in the anterior region of the SVcau endplate and in the posterior region of the TVcra and TVcau endplates (p < 0.10). Increased subsidence was observed in thinner endplates with lower trabecular bone volume fraction for both vertebroplasty and control groups (R(2) correlation up to 62%). In the SVcau endplate specifically, these 2 covariates aided in understanding subsidence differences between vertebroplasty and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Bone cement injected during vertebroplasty alters local biomechanics in elderly female spines, resulting in increased endplate disruption in treated and superior adjacent vertebrae. More specifically, bone cement increases subsidence in the posterior regions of the treated endplates and the anterior region of the superior caudal endplate. This increased subsidence may be the initial mechanism leading to subsequent compression fractures after vertebroplasty, particularly in vertebrae superior to the treated level.",eng,1.0

Miller,2013.0,Vertebroplasty increases compression of adjacent IVDs and vertebrae in osteoporotic spines,10.1016/j.spinee.2013.06.007,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Approximately 25% of vertebroplasty patients experience subsequent fractures within 1 year of treatment, and vertebrae adjacent to the cemented level are up to three times more likely to fracture than those further away. The increased risk of adjacent fractures postaugmentation raises concerns that treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures with vertebroplasty may negatively impact spine biomechanics. PURPOSE: To quantify the biomechanical effects of vertebroplasty on adjacent intervertebral discs (IVDs) and vertebral bodies (VBs). STUDY DESIGN: A biomechanics study was conducted using cadaveric thoracolumbar spinal columns from elderly women (age range, 51-98 years). METHODS: Five level motion segments (T11-L3) were assigned to a vertebroplasty treated or untreated control group (n=10/group) such that bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular architecture, and age were similar between groups. Compression fractures were created in the L1 vertebra of all specimens, and polymethylmethacrylate bone cement was injected into the fractured vertebra of vertebroplasty specimens. All spine segments underwent cyclic axial compression for 115,000 cycles. Microcomputed tomography imaging was performed before and after cyclic loading to quantify compression in adjacent VBs and IVDs. RESULTS: Cyclic loading increased strains 3% on average in the vertebroplasty group when compared with controls after 115,000 cycles. This global strain manifested locally as approximately fourfold more compression in the superior VB (T12) and two- to fourfold higher axial and circumferential deformations in the superior IVD (T12-L1) of vertebroplasty-treated specimens when compared with untreated controls. Low BMD and high cement fill were significant factors that explained the increased strain in the vertebroplasty-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that vertebroplasty alters spine biomechanics resulting in increased compression of adjacent VB and IVD in severely osteoporotic women and may be the basis for clinical reports of adjacent fractures after vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

In all cases, ASF relieved the patient's severe low back pain, and there was no recurrence of symptoms during the follow-up period of 6 years, on average. ASF is the optimal salvage procedure, since it allows for the direct decompression of nerve tissue with reconstruction of the collapsed spinal column, and preservation of the ligaments and muscles that stabilise the posterior spine.

The differences between low lumbar and thoracolumbar lesions should be studied to provide better treatment. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical and imaging features as well as outcomes of low lumbar OVC and to discuss the appropriate surgical treatment. METHODS: Thirty patients (10 men; 20 women; mean age 79.3 +/- 4.7 years [range 70-88 years]) with low lumbar OVC affecting levels below L-3 underwent surgical treatment. The clinical symptoms, morphological features of affected vertebra, sagittal spinopelvic alignment, neurological status before and after surgery, and surgical procedures were reviewed at a mean follow-up period of 2.4 years. RESULTS: The main clinical symptom was radicular leg pain. Most patients had old compression fractures at the thoracolumbar level. The affected vertebra was flat-type and concave or H-shaped type, not wedge type as often found in thoracolumbar OVC. There were mismatches between pelvic incidence and lumbar lordosis on plain radiographs. On CT and MR images, foraminal stenosis was seen in 18 patients (60%) and canal stenosis in 24 patients (80%). Decompression with short fusion using a posterior approach was performed. Augmentations of vertebroplasty, posterolateral fusion, and posterior lumbar interbody fusion were performed based on the presence/absence of local kyphosis of lumbar spine, cleft formation, and/or intervertebral instability. Although the neurological and visual analog scale scores improved postoperatively, 8 patients (26.7%) developed postoperative complications mainly related to instrumentation failure. In patients with postoperative complications, lumbar spine bone mineral density was significantly low, but the spinopelvic alignment showed no correlation when compared with those without complications. CONCLUSIONS: The main types of low lumbar OVC were flat-type and concave type, which resulted in neurological symptoms by retropulsed bony fragments generating foraminal stenosis and/or canal stenosis. For patients with low lumbar OVC, decompression of the foraminal and canal stenosis with short fusion surgery via posterior approach can improve neurological symptoms. Since these patients are elderly with poor bone quality and other complications, treatments for both OVC and osteoporosis should be provided to achieve good clinical outcome.",eng,1.0

The purpose of this study was to clarify the radiographic parameters contributing to the occurrence of DND, and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty for this pathology. METHODS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty was prospectively performed for 244 patients with OVCF with IVC; 30 had DND and 214 did not. Radiographic parameters of local kyphotic angle, percent spinal canal compromise and intravertebral instability were investigated for correlations to DND. Procedural outcomes were evaluated using visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and modified Frankel grades. RESULTS: Before vertebroplasty, no substantial difference in local kyphotic angle was seen between OVCF with IVC with and without DND, but percent spinal canal compromise and intravertebral instability were greater in OVCF with IVC with DND (P < 0.001). After vertebroplasty, 25 of 30 cases (84%) of OVCF with IVC with DND achieved clinically meaningful improvement (CMI), but 5 (17%) did not. Patients with CMI showed substantial improvements in intravertebral instability (P < 0.001), and no change in local kyphotic angle or percent spinal canal compromise. In five patients without CMI, four showed an initial improvement, but subsequent vertebral fracture adjacent to the treated vertebra caused neurologic re-deterioration. One patient with percent spinal canal compromise 54.9% and intravertebral instability 4 degrees achieved no neurologic improvement following vertebroplasty. No serious complications or adverse events related to the procedure were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: Intravertebral instability is the dominant cause of DND. Percutaneous vertebroplasty appears effective and safe in the treatment of OVCF with IVC with DND. Patients with less intravertebral instability and severe spinal canal compromise could be candidates for conventional surgical treatment.",eng,1.0

Takaoka,2006.0,[Vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fracture],CliCa0601153158,"Vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fracture has been published to enhance fractured vertebra and to reduce severe pain after the fracture. Bone cement such as Polymethylmethacrylate or calcium phosphate cement has been used for this procedure. However, serious neurological complication and pulmonary embolism might occur following the leakage of the cement. In order to avoid these serious complications, it seems to be important to make an enough space in the vertebral body before injecting bone cement. For this purpose, we utilized balloon inflation and endoscopic resection of connective tissue for pseudoarthrosis following osteoporotic vertebral fracture. With this procedure, severe pain after the fracture improved dramatically. So far, we did not have any serious systemic complications.",jpn,0.0

METHODS: Between August 2000 and April 2002, the authors performed 65 CPC-assisted vertebroplasty procedures in 55 patients with thoracic or lumbar osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Back and low-back pain were evaluated using the visual analog scale and the duration of analgesic medication requirement. Factors related to CPC leakage and the postoperative outcome were analyzed. There was a small amount of VB CPC leakage in 23 cases. In 10 of 23 cases, leakage into the epidural space was found. Although VB CPC leakage was independently associated with high initial age, female sex, high bone mineral density (BMD), short injury-surgery interval, and injection via the unipedicular route in the logistic regression analysis, there was no factor associated with CPC leakage into the epidural space. Cement leakage into the epidural space reduced the immediate therapeutic effects on fracture-related pain (p = 0.0128). All patients in whom cement leaked into the epidural space had improved by the 2-week follow-up examination. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced initial age, female sex, high BMD, a short interval from injury to surgery, and injection via the unipedicular route may increase the incidence of CPC leakage. Cement leakage into the epidural space attenuated only the immediate therapeutic effects of CPC-assisted vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

To investigate the effects of calcium phosphate cement (CPC)-based vertebroplasty on relief of pain and augmentation of the fractured vertebral body (VB), the authors compared the results of CPC-assisted vertebroplasty with those of conservative treatment alone. METHODS: Two groups of patients were examined: the vertebroplasty group (30 consecutive patients with primary OVCF) and the control group (30 patients matched for age, sex, interval from injury to treatment, and grade of the posterior wall defects of the fractured VB). Outcome measures included the visual analog scale (VAS) score of back pain and analgesic requirements, and the radiographically documented rate of the VB kyphosis. The follow-up duration was more than 12 months (mean 17 months). The mean VAS score at 12 months after injury was 0.67 cm in the vertebroplasty group and 1.97 cm in the control group, and the mean improvement rates in the VAS scores were 91.6 and 73.6%, respectively (p < 0.0001). The mean duration of analgesic requirement was 8.3 days in the vertebroplasty group and 62.2 days in the control group (p = 0.0005). The mean kyphosis rate at 12 months after injury was 72.9% in the vertebroplasty group and 58% in the control group, and the mean recovery rate of kyphosis was +8.4 and -21%, respectively (p < 0.0001).

The authors describe a series of patients in whom they performed percutaneous vertebroplasty by using calcium phosphate cement (CPC) to obtain early pain relief and improve the integrity of the osteoporotic vertebral body (VB). METHODS: Between August 2000 and February 2001, they performed 17 percutaneous transpedicular CPC-assisted vertebroplasty procedures in 16 patients who harbored thoracic or lumbar osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Following repositioning and curettage of the pathological soft tissues, CPC-assisted vertebroplasty was percutaneously performed in four patients with osteoporotic burst fracture and pseudarthrosis (Procedure A). In situ CPC-assisted vertebroplasty was performed in 12 patients with fresh vertebral compression fractures due to osteoporosis (Procedure B). Back pain and low-back pain were evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). The deformity index of the VB was measured on a lateral radiograph as the ratio of the VB's height (sum of measurements at anterior, middle, and posterior regions) to its longitudinal diameter. Based on VAS scores, pain was decreased in all patients immediately after surgery, and pain relief was maintained at the last follow up. The mean preoperative deformity index score of the VB was 1.43 in Procedure A and 1.67 in Procedure B; postoperatively scores improved to 1.59 and 1.93, respectively. At the 6-month follow-up examination, the mean deformity index score rebounded to 1.52 in Procedure A and 1.79 in Procedure B. Bone union was documented in all patients. Complications, such as a temporary respiratory insufficiency and a small amount of CPC leakage into the spinal canal, were observed in patients who underwent Procedure B. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous transpedicular CPC-assisted vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that provides early relief of pain and prevents vertebral collapse and pseudarthrosis in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture.",eng,0.0

Hirano,2014.0,Transpedicular vertebroplasty after intravertebral cavity formation versus conservative treatment for osteoporotic burst fractures,10.1016/j.spinee.2013.03.016,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: There has been no study regarding the comparison between vertebroplasty and conservative treatment for osteoporotic burst fracture. PURPOSE: To compare the results of vertebroplasty after intravertebral cavity formation with that of conservative treatment alone. STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. METHODS: The vertebroplasty group included 40 consecutive patients with primary osteoporotic burst fracture who underwent vertebroplasty using calcium phosphate cement, and the control group was made up of 40 patients given conservative treatment alone who were matched for age, gender, the injury level, and the type of fracture. Two groups of patients who had no neural deficit were prospectively examined. Clinical and radiological outcomes of these two groups were compared blindly. The authors do not report any conflict of interest in this study. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included visual analog scale (VAS) of the back pain, analgesic requirements, and mobility; in a lateral radiograph, the deformity index was measured and expressed as the ratio of the vertebral body (VB) height (sum of measurements at anterior, middle, and posterior regions of VB) to the longitudinal diameter of VB. Anteroposterior height comparison was expressed as the percentage of VB height at the anterior region compared with the height at the posterior region. Each recovery rate was calculated as a percentage by the formula: (value at the examination-value before treatment)/value before treatment x 100. RESULTS: The duration of follow-up was more than 12 months (mean; 22.5 months). The mean VAS at 12 months after injury was 2.17 cm in the conservative group and 0.61 cm in the vertebroplasty group (p=.0002). The mean duration of analgesic medication required was 157.2 days in the conservative group and 21.3 days in the vertebroplasty group (p=.0048). The mean deformity index at 12 months after injury was 1.66 in the vertebroplasty group and 1.38 in the control group, and the mean recovery rate was +7.3% and -18.4%, respectively (p<.0001). Anteroposterior height comparison at 12 months after injury was 49.1% in the conservative group and 71.2% in the vertebroplasty group, and the mean recovery rate was -26.4% and +30.1%, respectively (p<.0001). One fracture in the vertebroplasty group showed delayed union until 6 months after injury. In the control group, there were six delayed union including four pseudoarthroses at over 6 months after injury that caused leg pain and were treated by conservative therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that vertebroplasty after intravertebral cavity formation provided a better clinical and radiological result than conservative treatment for osteoporotic burst fracture.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To compare the surgical results of anterior and posterior combined surgery (AP) and posterior fixation with vertebroplasty (VP) for treating osteoporotic delayed vertebral collapse. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The optimal treatment of osteoporotic delayed vertebral collapse has been controversial. Because of aged patients' numerous comorbid medical complications and frequent instrumentation failure secondary to osteoporosis, it is challenging for surgeons to manage osteoporotic delayed vertebral collapse. In spite of this, there have been few reports comparing the surgical results. METHODS: A total of 93 patients with osteoporotic delayed vertebral fracture who underwent spinal surgery were enrolled at 6 hospitals. Sixty-five patients underwent AP surgery in 3 hospitals, and 28 patients underwent VP surgery in the other 3 hospitals. We restricted the spinal-fracture level to thoracolumbar lesion (T10-L2) and excluded patients followed up more than 2 years after surgery. The final numbers of patients included in this study were 24 in the AP group and 21 in the VP group. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, sex, disease duration, or duration of follow-up. RESULTS: Operative time was significantly longer and intraoperative blood loss significantly greater in the AP group. No significant difference between the 2 groups was observed in neurological improvement or the angle of kyphosis correction. However, the loss of correction was significantly greater in the VP group. There were no significant differences in perioperative respiratory or other complications. Implant-related complications and pseudarthrosis were more often observed in the VP group. One patient in the VP group underwent additional surgery for progression kyphosis. CONCLUSION: AP surgery provides stable spinal fixation and reduces implant failure particularly at the thoracolumbar junction because of load bearing of anterior spinal elements. Surgery-related complications in AP surgery were as few in number as with the VP group, and AP surgery is useful for osteoporotic delayed vertebral fracture.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Two hundred and one patients underwent vertebroplasty; of these, 15 were follow up for more than 2 years. For radiological analysis, we grouped the patients according to cement distribution as follows: group 1, unilateral, unilateral distribution of cement; group 2, bilateral-uneven, bilateral distribution of cement but separated mass; and group 3, bilateral-even, bilateral single mass of cement. To compare radiologic with clinical results, we assessed the visual analogue scale (VAS) score, amount of injected cement, bone mineral density (BMD), postoperative and follow-up vertebral body compression ratios, and postoperative and follow-up kyphotic angles. RESULTS: There were 4 (26.7%) patients in group 1, 6 (40.0%) in group 2, and 5 (33.3%) in group 3. The mean VAS score was 5.2 preoperatively, 1.8 postoperatively, and 3.2 at 2-year follow-up. The 2-year follow-up compression ratio was better in patients with even distribution of injected cement (group 2 and 3) than group 1. However, it was not statistically insignificant (p>0.05). The follow-up kyphotic angle was more aggravated in the group 1 than in the other groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that vertebroplasty had a beneficial effect on pain relief, particularly in the immediate postoperative stage. The augmented spine tended to be more stable in the cases with increased amount and more even distribution of injected cement.",eng,1.0

Typical symptoms are bone pain, malaise, anemia, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia. Incidental discovery on comprehensive laboratory panels is common. The disease is diagnosed with serum or urine protein electrophoresis or immunofixation and bone marrow aspirate analysis. Skeletal radiographs are important in staging multiple myeloma and revealing lytic lesions, vertebral compression fractures, and osteoporosis. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography or computed tomography are emerging as useful tools in the evaluation of patients with myeloma; magnetic resonance imaging is preferred for evaluating acute spinal compression. Nuclear bone scans and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry have no role in the diagnosis and staging of myeloma. The differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies includes monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance, smoldering (asymptomatic) and symptomatic multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and rare plasma cell leukemia and heavy chain diseases. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance or smoldering multiple myeloma should be followed closely, but not treated. Symptomatic multiple myeloma is treated with chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, if possible. Melphalan, prednisolone, dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, bortezomib, and thalidomide and its analogue lenalidomide have been used successfully. It is important that family physicians recognize and appropriately treat multiple myeloma complications. Bone pain is treated with opiates, bisphosphonates, radiotherapy, vertebroplasty, or kyphoplasty; nephrotoxic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. Hypercalcemia is treated with isotonic saline infusions, steroids, furosemide, or bisphosphonates. Because of susceptibility to infections, patients require broad-spectrum antibiotics for febrile illness and immunization against influenza, pneumococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae B.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) for thoracolumbar AO type A3 fractures with a specially designed surgical instrument system. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive surgery including PPSF is becoming increasingly widespread in the spine surgery. The technique of PPSF was mostly used as supplemental fixation combined with minimally invasive posterior or anterior lumbar interbody fusion in management of lumbar degenerative disorders. There are fewer studies available in literature regarding PPSF without additional kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty for management of thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: Thirty-six adult patients, who had single thoracolumbar AO type A3 fractures and the load-sharing score of 6 or less, underwent application of percutaneous short-segment pedicle screw fixation. Radiologic parameters including kyphotic angle and vertebral height loss were assessed before and after surgery, and functional outcome was evaluated by Prolo questionnaire. RESULTS: All patients were successfully managed with percutaneous minimal invasive procedures. The average operative time was 78 minutes (range 62 to 117 min). The average intraoperative blood loss was 75 mL (range 50 to 220 mL).

METHODS: Seventy-six patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and pain duration more than one month were underwent procedures of PKP between August 2005 and August 2010. The incidence and radiological features of IVC were analyzed. Sixty-one patients with single-level OVCFs were divided into two groups with and without IVC. Preoperative and postoperative kyphotic angle and relative anterior vertebral height were recorded, as well as visual analogue scales (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI). Cement patterns of opacification and leakage were also recorded. RESULTS: Thirty two patients with 39 vertebrates were found with IVC sign. The diagnostic sensitivity of X ray, CT and MRI for IVC was respectively 33.3%, 85.7% and 84.6%. Two groups with IVC and without IVC both had apparent correction of kyphotic angle and reduction of anterior height at 3 days after surgery and last follow-up (F = 21.82 - 72.18, P < 0.01). There was no statistical significance between two groups (P > 0.05). In addition, both groups had significant improvement as regard to VAS and ODI (F = 131.06 - 364.12, P < 0.01).

OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the relation between accomplishment of pain relief through percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) and the cemented fraction of the vertebral body and subsequent determination of the optimal intravertebral cement volume. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The mechanism of pain relief of PVP as a treatment modality for painful OVCFs remains unclear. Generally, benefit of PVP is thought to result from stabilization of micromovements and collapse of the fractured vertebral body. However, studies indicating a relation between intravertebral cement volume and pain relief are lacking and an optimal value of the intravertebral cement volume is unknown. METHODS: One hunderd six patients who received PVP for 196 painful OVCFs were prospectively followed on back pain (score 0-10) and occurrence of new OVCFs during the first postoperative year. Patients were classified as responders (average postoperative back pain </= 6) and nonresponders (average postoperative back pain >6). The cemented fraction of the vertebral body was determined using volumetric analysis of the postoperative CT scan of the treated levels. Analysis was performed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and multivariable regression techniques. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (27.3%) were found to be nonresponders. Mean intravertebral cement volume in all 196 treated OVCFs was 3.94 mL (SD = 1.89, range 0.13-10.8). The mean cemented vertebral body fraction was significantly lower in nonresponders (0.15 vs. 0.21, P = 0.002). The ROC area-under-curve of the cemented fraction as a predictor of accomplishment of pain relief was 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57-0.78, P = 0.006). In subgroups without specific influential factors (new OVCFs, intravertebral clefts), significantly stronger associations were found. A vertebral body fraction of 24% was identified as the optimal fraction to be cemented. This fraction corresponded to a 93% to 100% specificity for accomplishment of pain relief (i.e., few to no cases without pain relief in the presence of adequate cementing) without being significantly associated with a higher risk of occurrence of cement leakage or new OVCFs. Corresponding values for the recommended (optimal) intravertebral cement volume were provided based on its governing characteristics (fracture level, fracture severity, and patient's sex). CONCLUSION: An optimal intravertebral cement volume was identified for accomplishment of pain relief through PVP in painful OVCFs. Appropriate thresholds were provided to guide the operator.",eng,1.0

A large number of studies have shown promising results and the superiority of this treatment over conservative treatment has been established. Results of the first two, long-awaited, placebo-controlled trials were unexpected: improvement after PVP was similar to improvement after placebo treatment. Limitations in the design of both trials prevented widespread implementation of the results. We believe that PVP cannot be regarded as an obsolete treatment as long as patients are carefully selected. Patients with persistent (over 2 months) and painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures have been shown to benefit from vertebroplasty and are therefore suitable candidates for this procedure, which, in these cases, can prevent complications due to long-term disabling pain.",dut,0.0

OBJECTIVE: Comparison of outcome between patients treated with Percutaneous VertebroPlasty (PVP) using low and medium viscosity PolyMethylMetAcrylate (PMMA) bone cement. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Viscosity is the characterizing parameter of PMMA bone cement, currently the standard augmentation material in PVP, and influences interdigitation, cement distribution inside the vertebral body, injected volume and extravasation, thereby affecting the clinical outcome of PVP. Currently, low, medium, and high viscosity PMMA bone cements are used interchangeably. However, effect of viscosity on clinical outcome in patients with Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fractures (OVCFs) has not yet been explicit subject of investigation. METHODS: Follow-up was conducted using a 0 to 10 Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Quality of Life questionnaire before PVP and at 7 days (PI-NRS only), 1, 3, and 12 months after PVP. Injected cement volume, degree of interdigitation, and cement leakage were analyzed on direct postoperative computed tomography scanning. At 6 and 52 weeks and at suspicion, patients were analyzed for new fractures. RESULTS: A total of 30 consecutive patients received PVP using low viscosity PMMA bone cement (OsteoPal-V) for 62 OVCFs, followed by 34 patients who received PVP using medium viscosity PMMA bone cement (Disc-O-Tech) for 67 OVCFs. Results regarding PI-NRS and SF-36 were comparable between both groups. Postoperative comparison of injected cement volume, degree of interdigitation, proportion of bipedicular procedures, incidence of new vertebral fractures and complications revealed no differences between both groups. Viscosity was identified as a risk factor for the occurrence of cement leakage (yes/no, OR: 2.925, 95% confidence interval: [1.072-7.984], P = 0.036). CONCLUSION: No major differences in clinical outcome after PVP in OVCFs using low and medium viscosity PMMA bone cement were found. Viscosity of PMMA bone cement was identified as an independent predictor of cement leakage.",eng,1.0

Dijkstra,2013.0,New vertebral fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty for painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: a clustered analysis and the relevance of intradiskal cement leakage,10.1148/radiol.12120751,"PURPOSE: To perform clustered analysis of fracture-free probabilities of intact nontreated vertebrae after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in painful long-standing osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) to determine risk factors for new vertebral fractures and estimate fracture-free probabilities of multiple intact nontreated vertebrae given their patient- and vertebra-specific covariate status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Informed consent and institutional review board approval were obtained. A total of 115 patients who underwent PVP for 216 painful long-standing OVCFs were prospectively followed up to detect new OVCFs during the 1st postoperative year. A total of 1031 intact vertebrae were available for clustered analysis of fracture-free probabilities by using a Cox proportional hazard frailty model. A clustered analysis takes clustering or correlation of fracture-free survival probabilities of individual intact vertebrae within one patient into account to improve estimates of fracture-free probabilities and risk factors. Relevant patient- and vertebra-specific covariates were included. Volumetric analysis of intradiskal cement leakage was performed by using a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). RESULTS: Three- and 12-month vertebral fracture-free probability was 97.0% and 94.5%, respectively. Strong patient-level risk factors included low bone mineral density (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53 per unit increase), high spinal deformity index (HR, 2.23 per five units increase), and low fracture age (HR, 0.52 per 2 months increase). Strong vertebra-specific risk factors were thoracolumbar localization (HR, 2.33), vicinity to the treated level (adjacent level HR, 3.53), and presence of intradiskal cement leakage (HR, 8.21). Fracture-free probabilities of individual vertebrae were clustered within a patient (ie, not independent) (P = .009). The predicted 1-year fracture-free probability of an individual vertebra could be as high as 99.8% or as low as 19.9% based on absence or presence of risk factors, respectively. Larger intradiskal cement leakage volumes were associated with a higher likelihood of occurrence of new adjacent OVCFs (area under the ROC curve, 0.70). CONCLUSION: New vertebral fractures after PVP were clustered within patients and depended heavily on the presence or absence of both patient- and vertebra-specific risk factors. Intradiskal cement leakage was a pronounced augmentation-related risk factor, for which a volumetric association was found.",eng,1.0

Dijkstra,2011.0,Cement leakage in percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: identification of risk factors,10.1016/j.spinee.2011.07.027,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a common treatment modality for painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). The complication rate of PVP is low, but cement leakage occurs in up to 90% of the treated levels. Recent evidence suggests that sequelae of cement leakage may be more common and clinically relevant than previously thought. Preoperative appreciation of risk factors would therefore be helpful but has not been thoroughly investigated. PURPOSE: Identification of preoperative risk factors for the occurrence of cement leakage in PVP for painful OVCFs. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective assessment of risk factors using multivariate analysis. PATIENT SAMPLE: Eighty-nine patients treated with PVP for 177 painful OVCFs. OUTCOME MEASURE: Occurrence of cement leakage. METHODS: The influence of all known risk factors and other parameters potentially affecting the occurrence of cement leakage was retrospectively assessed using multivariate analysis. Patient age, sex, and spinal deformity index; fracture age, level, type, and semiquantitative severity grade (1-4), the presence of an intravertebral cleft and/or cortical disruption on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the viscosity of bone cement were included. Cement leakage was assessed on direct postoperative computed tomography scanning of the treated levels. In addition to cement leakage in general, three fundamentally different leakage types (cortical, epidural, and anterior venous), with different possible clinical sequelae, were discerned, and their respective risk factors were assessed. RESULTS: In 130 of 173 (75.1%) treated OVCFs, cement leakage was detected. Leakage incidence was found to increase approximately linear with advancing severity grade. High fracture semiquantitative severity grade (adjusted per grade relative risk [RR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.24; p=.002) and low bone cement viscosity (medium vs. low viscosity: adjusted RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.87; p<.001) were strong risk factors for cement leakage in general. For cortical leakage (in 95% intradiscal leakage), the presence of cortical disruption on MRI (adjusted RR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.16-2.26; p=.004) and an intravertebral cleft on MRI (adjusted RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.07-1.77; p=.017) were identified as additional strong risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: High fracture severity grade and low viscosity of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement are general, strong, and independent risk factors for cement leakage. Using MRI assessment, cortical disruption and the presence of an intravertrebral cleft were identified as additional strong risk factors regarding cortical (intradiscal) cement leakage, thereby potentiating anticipation.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective follow-up study was conducted using a 0-10 pain intensity numerical rating scale and the Short Form-36 General Health Survey (SF-36) quality-of-life questionnaire, completed before PVP and 7 days (pain only), 1 month, 3 months, and 12 months after PVP. Cement leakage was analyzed on postoperative computed tomography (CT) scanning. The presence of new fractures was assessed at 6 weeks and 52 weeks and when suspected clinically. RESULTS: Decrease in average and worst back pain was 2.5 points and 3.0 points after 7 days, and 2.5 points and 2.9 points after 12 months. The physical and mental SF-36 summary scores were significantly increased. Incidence of cement leakage in vsOVCFs was 91.9%, which was substantially higher compared with non-vsOVCFs (n = 40) treated in the same patients (64.1%; odds ratio [OR] 6.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-24.5, P = .004). Mean leakage volume per treated vertebra was more than twice as high (0.80 mL vs 0.32 mL; P < .001). Seventeen new OVCFs in 11 patients (32.4%) were identified. Only one (2.9%) minor complication occurred, confirming the feasibility of PVP in vsOVCFs. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with painful vsOVCFs can be treated with, and benefit from, PVP. Although technically more demanding and with a higher procedural risk (ie, more frequent necessity of placement of a second needle, higher leakage incidence, and greater leakage volumes), PVP is technically feasible and should not be withheld from these patients.",eng,1.0

With the position of vertebroplasty having been challenged by recent placebo-controlled studies, appropriate timing gains importance. We investigated the relationship between the onset of symptoms - the time from fracture - and the efficacy of vertebroplasty in 115 patients with 216 painful subacute or chronic OVCFs (mean time from fracture 6.0 months (sd 2.9)). These patients were followed prospectively in the first post-operative year to assess the level of back pain and by means of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We also investigated whether greater time from fracture resulted in a higher risk of complications or worse pre-operative condition, increased vertebral deformity or the development of nonunion of the fracture as demonstrated by the presence of an intravertebral cleft. It was found that there was an immediate and sustainable improvement in the level of back pain and HRQoL after vertebroplasty, which was independent of the time from fracture. Greater time from fracture was associated with neither worse pre-operative conditions nor increased vertebral deformity, nor with the presence of an intravertebral cleft. We conclude that vertebroplasty can be safely undertaken at an appropriate moment between two and 12 months following the onset of symptoms of an OVCF.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the diagnostic assessment and clinical significance of the intravertebral cleft in painful, long-standing osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with painful OVCFs with intravertebral clefts provide a unique and possibly superior indication for PVP. However, comparative studies are scarce, and the results are conflicting. The extent of the difference attributable to interobserver variation in the identification of an intravertebral cleft is currently unknown. METHODS: A total of 102 patients received PVP for 197 painful long-standing OVCFs and were prospectively observed, using a pain-intensity numerical-rating scale for back pain, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey quality-of-life questionnaire, and routine spinal radiographs. Three experienced examiners retrospectively examined all preoperative radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1-weighted and short-tau-inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences and the direct postoperative computed tomographic scans for the presence of an intravertebral cleft. Disagreements were re-examined and discussed for consensus. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for the detection of an intravertebral cleft was moderate on preoperative radiography (kappa, 0.55-0.59) and substantial on preoperative MRI (kappa, 0.71-0.79) and postoperative computed tomography (kappa, 0.67-0.85). On the basis of consensus, 42 (21.3%) clefts were detected. The associated sensitivity of preoperative radiography was low (31.7%-48.8%), but the specificity was high (94.7%-99.3%). The diagnostic performance of preoperative MRI T1-weighted and STIR sequences was excellent, with both high sensitivity (85.7%-88.1%) and high specificity (89.7%-98.1%). Pain decrease and increase in quality of life obtained from PVP were ultimately comparable with patients without intravertebral clefts but was obtained more gradually during the first postoperative year. An intravertebral cleft was a strong risk factor for the occurrence of cortical cement leakage (odds ratio, 4.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-12.2; P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: There is variation between observers in the identification of an intravertebral cleft, and the identification of an intravertebral cleft is not always straightforward. For preoperative assessment, we recommend MRI with T1-weighted and STIR sequences. Regarding patient-reported outcome, patients with long-standing OVCFs with intravertebral clefts benefit from PVP, but, compared with patients with OVCFs without intravertebral clefts, the benefit obtained was not superior and may be delayed.",eng,1.0

Fan,2015.0,New Levels of Vertebral Compression Fractures after Percutaneous Kyphoplasty: Retrospective Analysis of Styles and Risk Factors,", ","BACKGROUND: The causes of subsequent vertebral fractures after kyphoplasty are debated. It is reported that most new vertebral fractures after kyphoplasty develop in adjacent vertebrae. OBJECTIVES: We explored whether kyphoplasty increases the incidence of adjacent vertebral fractures and identified risk factors for new vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) after kyphoplasty. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatient population of a single center. METHODS: We studied 356 patients treated with kyphoplasty from January 2008 to March 2012. Among those patients, there were 35 new VCFs after kyphoplasty. Subsequently, these patients were divided into 2 groups: an adjacent fracture"" group and a ""nonadjacent fracture"" group. In addition, all patients treated with kyphoplasty were further assigned to either a ""new fracture"" group or a ""no fracture"" group. RESULTS: The occurrence of new VCFs in the ""nonadjacent fracture"" group was significantly higher than that in the ""adjacent fracture"" group. The average bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine was -3.95 in the ""new fracture"" group and -2.86 in the ""no fracture"" group. The risk of new vertebral fracture increased as the bone mineral density decreased (P < 0.05). The morbidity of women was significantly higher in the ""new fracture"" group (94.29%) than in the ""no fracture"" group (77.88%) (P = 0.025). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study at a single center. CONCLUSION: New VCFs after kyphoplasty occurred most often in nonadjacent vertebrae. VCFs after kyphoplasty were common in patients with low bone mineral density and in women, suggesting that osteoporosis is an underlying mechanism.

The mean follow-up period was 16.6 months. The pain associated with this procedure, effects on adjacent vertebral bodies, and other complications were evaluated. The rate of recollapse after vertebroplasty was examined in 26 patients with 26 vertebral bodies treated and followed up for more than 3 months. Mean time of operation was 57 minutes and mean number of blocks used per vertebral body was 104. The mean visual analogue scale score was 7.0 preoperatively and 1.6 postoperatively. The mean decline in postoperative vertebral body height was 13%. New vertebral body fractures occurred postoperatively in 3 vertebral bodies in 2 patients. Leakage of blocks outside the vertebral body occurred in 2 patients during the operation, and after the operation in one patient, and the hydroxyapatite plug broke postoperatively in one patient. Hydroxyapatite blocks yielded good pain relief comparable to bone cement, with no serious complications such as a pulmonary embolism or leakage into the spinal canal, and are effective for percutaneous vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

There was no statistically significant difference between the operators (P = 0.40) or the angles (P = 0.32). For five lung biopsy patients, the distance from the target point planned before biopsy to the actual last puncture point was 0-8 mm. For 10 percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) patients (two performed in Th11, one in Th12, five in L1, two in L2), the plan before the puncture procedure was to pass the needle through the vertebral pedicle in all cases. The distance between the planned target point and the actual last puncture point was 0-5 mm.

Despite this, during follow-up of our patients, we observed recompression of augmented vertebrae with significant vertebral height loss and aggravation of local kyphotic deformity. PURPOSE: To identify the risk factors related to recompression and to evaluate the clinical significance of recompression. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one patients who underwent single-level kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fractures were retrospectively analyzed and classified into the following two groups: group 1 with recompression and group 2 without recompression. Characteristics of patients and fractured vertebrae were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for recompression. We evaluated the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores in both groups to elucidate the clinical impact. RESULTS: During an average of 20.75 +/- 4.43 months of follow-up, 17 augmented vertebrae developed recompression. In the recompression group, vertebral height loss was accompanied by significantly aggravated local kyphotic deformity. The local kyphotic angle differed significantly between the two groups at final follow-up (P = 0.011). However, the VAS and ODI scores were maintained at final follow-up in both groups although the values were slightly higher in group 1. Solid lump distribution pattern (OR = 8.718; P = 0.003) and the degree of vertebral height restoration (OR = 1.260; P < 0.001) were identified as the most important risk factors for recompression.

Neurological deficit in OVFs is rare despite the involved posterior cortex of the fractured vertebral body, severe kyphotic deformity, or the instability at the fracture site. OVF with resulting neurological deficit was considered as a contraindication for vertebral augmentation techniques. We reported a rare case of a 75-year-old woman with L1, L2 osteoporotic vertebral fractures and L5/S1 disc herniation who presented with back pain and radicular pain extending along the posterior aspect of the left leg. Physical examination showed slight weakness of her flexor hallucis longus and absence of ankle jerk on her left leg. The result of a straight leg-raising test was limited to an angle of 50 degrees. The radiographs showed that the nerve root was compressed by the retropulsed bone fragment of the L2 vertebral body and a herniated disc at the level of L5/S1 on the left side. After L1 and L2 kyphoplasty the radicular pain as well as the back pain was completely disappeared. At her two-year follow-up examination, the patient was completely symptom free and reported no radicular pain. This case suggested that minimally invasive techniques such as kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty are effective in certain OVF patients with neurological deficit. Radicular pain could be caused by osteoporotic fracture that involves the posterior cortex of the vertebral body. Understanding the anatomy of nerve roots and pathogenetic mechanism of radicular pain is particularly important for treatment option.",eng,0.0

In addition, the pain experienced by a further 29 patients with new traumatic vertebral body fractures was monitored over a 12-month period. These fractures were partly managed by fixateur interne alone and by a combination of fixateur interne and kyphoplasty. RESULTS: The 40 patients treated by kyphoplasty had a baseline VAS score of 26.2+/-2.00, which increased to 44.4+/-3.11 after 12 months, while the respective scores for the control group were 33.6+/-4.21 and 34.3+/-4.35.

Vertebroplasty and percutaneous kyphoplasty have played essential roles in the treatment of painful vertebral metastasis, although there are few reports with long survival that have evaluated the long-term efficacy, adjacent fractures and vertebral body (VB) re-collapse associated with these procedures. We aimed to evaluate the longterm efficacy and the complications associated with malignancy and changes in spinal biomechanics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective study examined 32 patients with osteolytic VCF due to malignant infiltration of the vertebral body. A visual analogue scale, the EQ5 and radiological analysis (i.e., X-ray and CT scan) were used to assess back pain, quality of life and complications. RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions in anterior and central vertebral body heights (6.2 mm-19.6 +/- 4.2 mm- and 5.8 mm- 16.7 +/- 7.8 mm-, respectively) that resulted in reductions of the regional Cobb angles exceeding 30% were observed. There was also a statistically significant improvement in quality of life. The average survival was longer than those reported in most published articles, and the average follow-up period was 30.9 months. CONCLUSION: Anatomical restoration (i.e., cortical ring reduction with endplate rebalancing) is potentially beneficial for a wellselected group of patients with spine metastases and long life expectancies because this procedure avoids the complications typical of these types of treatments (e.g., leakage, adjacent fractures and re-collapse).",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty non-consecutive patients (mean age 50.7 years; range 45-56) treated because of vertebral fractures, were included in this study. There were 10 A3.1 and 10 A1.2 fractures (AO classification). Surgical treatment using VAP was applied in 14 cases, and conservative in 6 patients. MRI T2-weighted images and mapping of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the intervertebral disc adjacent to the fractured segment were performed after a mean follow-up of 32 months. A total of 60 discs, 3 per patient, were analysed: infra-adjacent, supra-adjacent and a control disc one level above the supra-adjacent. RESULTS: No differences between patients surgically treated and those following a conservative protocol regarding the average ADC values obtained in the 20 control discs analysed were found. Considering all discs, average ADC in the supra-adjacent level was lower than in the infra-adjacent (1.35 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.53 +/- 0.06; p < 0.001). Average ADC values of the discs used as a control were similar to those of the infra-adjacent level (1.54 +/- 0.06). Compared to surgically treated patients, discs at the supra-adjacent fracture level showed statistically significant lower values in cases treated conservatively (p < 0.001). The variation in the delay of surgery had no influence on the average values of ADC at any of the measured levels.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of treatment by vertebroplasty (VP) with polymethylmethacrylate cement and VP with calcium phosphate cement on the creation of adjacent vertebral body fracture following VP. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Adjacent vertebral body fractures have been reported as a complication following VP. METHODS: Twenty-four spinal columns (T10-L2) from human cadavers were subjected to dual energy radiograph absorptiometry to assess bone mineral density. They were divided into the P group and C group, and experimental vertebral compression fractures were created at T12 vertebrae. T12 vertebrae were augmented with polymethylmethacrylate and calcium phosphate cement in the P group and C group, respectively. Each spinal column was compressed until a new fracture occurred at any vertebra, and the location of newly fractured vertebra and failure load was investigated. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in bone mineral density at each level within each group. In the P group, a new fracture occurred at T10 in 2 specimens, T11 in 8, and L1 in 2. In the C group, it occurred at T10 in 1 specimen, T11 in 2, L1 in 1, and T12 (treated vertebra) in 8. The failure loads of the spinal column were 1774.8+/-672.3 N and 1501.2+/-556.5 N in the P group and C group, respectively. There was no significant difference in the failure load of the spinal column between each group. CONCLUSION: New vertebral fractures occurred at the vertebra adjacent to augmented vertebrae in the P group and in the augmented vertebrae in the C group. The difference in the fractured site may be because of the difference in strength between the 2 bone filler materials. Therefore, the strength of bone filler materials is considered a risk factor in developing adjacent vertebral body fractures after VP.",eng,1.0

Bail,2013.0,[A rare complication of kyphoplasty is PMMA-cement loosening - case report and literature review],10.1055/s-0033-1350861,"INTRODUCTION: For vertebral body fractures combined with strong back pain, the kyphoplasty is an established method for pain reduction. A balloon effects an excavation in the vertebral body, which will be filled up with cement. We distinguish between cements of polymethyl metacrylate (PMMA) and calcium phosphate. Their diverse chemical qualities enable different indications. CASE REPORT: A 72-year-old male patient with refractory back pain after a lumbar vertebral body fracture was treated with a kyphoplasty operation. After four days the patient went home with clearly less pain. After two months the patient had a bagatelle trauma at home, which caused an exacerbation of the back pain. In computered tomography we saw a disruption of the PMMA cement plombage forwards and also a kyphosis of the lumbar vertebrae. Therefore we had to operate on the patient two more times. The first time we stabilised the spine from dorsal via an internal fixator. The additive ventral fixation was at that time declined by the patient. Because of the persistency of the back pain after operation combined with a sense of instability, we were ten days after the first revision allowed to stabilise the patient from ventrally with a Harms cage. At the first-year follow-up the patient was still free of pain. CONCLUSION: Injuries of the vertebral body frame cannot be operated exclusively with kyphoplasty. The reason for this is the instability of the vertebral body despite the injection of the PMMA cement. We advise to stabilise the spine in such cases with a dorsal internal fixator additively.",ger,0.0

Type I collagen derived from bovine Achilles tendon was ground cryogenically to produce an average fibre length of 0.96+/-0.55 mm and manually mixed into the powder phase of an apatite-based cement at 1, 3 or 5 wt.%. Fibre addition of up to 5 wt.% had a significant effect (P </= 0.001) on the fracture toughness, which was increased by 172%. Adding </= 1 wt.% bovine collagen fibres did not compromise the compressive properties significantly, however, a decrease of 39-53% was demonstrated at >/= 3wt.% fibre loading. Adding bovine collagen to the calcium phosphate cement reduced the initial and final setting times to satisfy the clinical requirements stated for vertebroplasty. The cement viscosity increased in a linear manner (R(2)=0.975) with increased loading of collagen fibres, such that the injectability was found to be reduced by 83% at 5 wt.% collagen loading.

Hall,2008.0,The biomechanics of vertebroplasty in multiple myeloma and metastatic bladder cancer: a preliminary cadaveric investigation,10.3171/spi.2008.9.11.493,"OBJECT: The vertebral column is the most common site for secondary bone metastases and lesions arising from hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM). These infiltrations can be lytic in nature and cause severe weakening of the vertebral body, an increased risk of fracture, and spinal cord compression leading to neurological deficit. Qualitatively it is apparent that increasing infiltration of these lytic lesions will have a deleterious effect on the mechanical behavior of the vertebrae. However, there is little quantitative information about the relationship between tumor deposits and the impact on the mechanical behavior of the vertebrae. In addition, there have been limited biomechanical assessments of the use of vertebroplasty in the management of these malignancies. The purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate the mechanical behavior of lesion-infiltrated vertebrae from 2 malignant cancers and to investigate the effectiveness of vertebroplasty with and without tumor debulking. METHODS: Individual vertebrae from 2 donor spines--one with MM and another with bone metastases secondary to bladder cancer-were fractured under an eccentric flexion load, from which failure strength and stiffness were derived. Alternate vertebrae defined by spinal level were assigned to 2 groups: Group 1 involved removal of lesion material with Coblation (ArthroCare Corp.) preceding vertebroplasty; Group 2 received no Coblation prior to augmentation. All vertebrae were fractured postaugmentation under the same loading protocol. Micro-CT assessments were undertaken to investigate vertebral morphology, fracture patterns, and cement distribution. RESULTS: Multiple myeloma involvement was characterized by several small lesions, severe bone degradation, and multiple areas of vertebral shell compromise. In contrast, large focal lesions were present in the vertebrae with metastatic bladder cancer, and the shell generally remained intact. The mean initial failure strength of the vertebrae with metastases secondary to MM was significantly lower than in vertebrae with bone metastases secondary to bladder cancer (Load = 950 +/- 300 N vs 2200 +/- 750 N, p < 0.0001). A significant improvement in relative fracture strength was found postaugmentation for both lesion types (1.4 +/- 0.5, p < 0.001). Coblation provided a marginally significant increase in the same parameter postaugmentation (p = 0.08) and qualitatively improved the ease of injection and guidance of cement. CONCLUSIONS: In the vertebral column, metastatic lesions secondary to bladder cancer and MM showed variations in the pattern of infiltration, both of which led to significant reductions in fracture strength. Account should be taken of these differences to optimize the vertebroplasty intervention in terms of the cement formulation, delivery, and any additional surgical procedure.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Twelve human cadaveric 3-vertebral functional spinal units (T12-L2) were prepared such that the intact L-1 vertebra was prophylactically augmented with cements of differing elastic moduli (100, 50, 25, and 12.5% modulus of the base cement). These specimens were subjected to quasistatic subfailure compression pre- and postaugmentation to 50% of the predicted failure strength and then cyclic loading in a fatigue rig (115,000 cycles) to characterize the high-stress, short-cycle fatigue properties of the construct. Loading was increased incrementally in proportion to body weight to a maximum of 3.5 x body weight. Quantitative computed tomography assessment was conducted pre- and postaugmentation and following cyclic testing to assess vertebral condition, cement placement, and fracture classification. RESULTS: Adjacent and periaugmentation fractures were induced in the prophylactically augmented segments. However, it appeared that these fractures mainly occurred when the specimens were subjected to loads beyond those that may commonly occur during most normal physiological activities. CONCLUSIONS: Lowering the elastic modulus of the cement appeared to have no significant effect on the frequency or severity of the induced fracture within the vertebral segment.",eng,1.0

Short-term results are promising, although longer-term complications may arise from accelerated failure of the adjacent vertebral body. PURPOSE: To provide a preliminary biomechanical assessment of prophylactic vertebral reinforcement adjacent to vertebroplasty using a three-vertebra cadaveric segment under dynamic loads that represent increasing activity demands. In addition, the effects of reducing the elastic modulus of the cement used in the intact vertebrae were also assessed. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Three-vertebra cadaveric segments were used to evaluate vertebroplasty with adjacent vertebral reinforcement as an intervention for VCFs. METHODS: Nine human three-vertebra segments (T12-L2) were prepared and a compression fracture was generated in the superior vertebrae. Vertebroplasty was performed on the fractured T12 vertebra. Subsequently, the adjacent intact L1 vertebra was prophylactically augmented with cement of differing elastic moduli (100-12.5% modulus of the base cement value). After subfailure quasi-static compression tests before and after augmentation, these specimens were subjected to an incrementally increasing dynamic load profile in proportion to patient body weight (BW) to assess the fatigue properties of the construct. Quantitative computed tomography assessments were conducted at several stages in the experimental process to evaluate the vertebral condition and quantify the gross dimensions of the segment. RESULTS: No significant difference in construct stiffness was found pre- or postaugmentation (t=1.4, p=.19). Displacement plots recorded during dynamic loading showed little evidence of fracture under normal physiological loads or moderate activity (1-2.5x BW). A third of the specimens continued to endure increasing load demands and were confirmed to have no fracture after testing. In six specimens, however, greater loads induced 11 fractures: 7 in the augmented vertebra (2xT12, 5xL5) and 4 in the adjacent L2 vertebra. A strong correlation was observed between the subsidence in the segmental unit and the incidence of fracture after testing (r(Spearman's)=-0.88, p=.002). Altering the modulus of cement in the intact vertebra had no effect on level of segmental compromise. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that under normal physiological loads associated with moderate physical activity, prophylactic augmentation adjacent to vertebroplasty showed little evidence of inducing fractures, although loads representing more strenuous activities may generate adjacent and peri-augmentation compromise. Reducing the elastic modulus of the cement in the adjacent intact vertebrae appeared to have no significant effect on the incidence or location of the induced fracture or the overall height loss of the vertebral segment.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate 2 different methods with respect to height restoration and preservation in a cadaver model under cyclic loading. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Standard balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) represents a well-established treatment opportunity for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. BKP was developed to restore vertebral height and improve sagittal alignment. Its use has grown significantly over the last 2 decades. In contrast, distinct biomechanical data are missing. Within the last few years, several alternative techniques with regard to height restoration have emerged, such as radiofrequency kyphoplasty (RFK). METHODS: Twenty-five vertebral bodies of 2 female cadavers with secured osteoporosis were examined. Standardized vertebral wedge compression fractures were created. Afterward, 2 groups were randomly assigned: 12 vertebral bodies were treated with BKP and 13 vertebral bodies by RFK under a preload of 100 N. Then the vertebral bodies underwent cyclic loading (100,000 cycles, 100 to 600 N, 5 Hz). Anterior, central, and posterior vertebral body heights were evaluated by CT scans. RESULTS: Anterior height was reduced after fracture 6.3 mm (SD 3) for the BKP group and 7.2 mm (SD 3) in the RFK group (P>0.1). After treatment, the difference in the initial anterior height was 4.5 mm (SD 2) for the BKP group and 4.7 mm (SD 3) for the RFK group (P>0.1). After cyclic loading, the difference was 5.3 mm (SD 3) for the BKP group and 5.2 mm (SD 3) for the RFK group (P>0.1). The average cement volume used was 8.7 mL (SD 1) for the BKP group and 4.8 mL (SD 2) for the RFK group (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our results, the unipedicular RFK in osteoporotic compression fractures might represent a promising alternative for the clinical setting.",eng,0.0

Gradual vertebral height decrease also may induce aggravation of kyphotic change without severe pain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate risk factors for gradual vertebral height decrease in the absence of recurrent severe back pain. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 44 patients who were diagnosed with a first osteoporotic compression fracture at a single level at the thoracolumbar junction. All patients were taken vertebroplasty. Possible risk factors for gradual vertebral height decrease, such as sex, age, bone mineral density, body mass index, level of compression fracture, volume of injected cement, cement leakage into disc space, and air clefts within fractured vertebrae, were analyzed. RESULTS: Gradual vertebral height decrease of augmented vertebrae occurred commonly when more than 4 cc of injected cement was used, and when air clefts within fractured vertebrae were seen on admission. In addition, the sagittal Cobb angle more commonly increased during the follow-up period in such cases. CONCLUSION: Injection of more than 4 cc of cement during vertebroplasty and air cleft within fractured vertebrae on admission induced gradual vertebral height decrease in augmented vertebrae.

We inserted normal saline-mixed gelfoam to the anterior third of vertebral body via PVP needle, and then 3mL of polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) was injected. We prospectively evaluated the incidence and leakage pattern of PMMA by postoperative computed tomography. RESULTS: Between gelfoam and control groups, there were 11 leaks (22%) versus 12 leaks (26%). The mean operation time was 7.00 minutes versus 6.30 minutes. In gelfoam group, there were 6 spinal canal leaks, 4 paravertebral venous leaks, and 1 soft tissue leaks. In control group, there were 4 spinal canal leaks, 8 paravertebral venous leaks, and 1 disc space leak. In spite of cement leakage, there was no symptomatic case in both groups.

A comprehensive literature review was conducted using MEDLINE for all articles published on traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures through to July 2013. LOE was assigned according to the standards set forth by the Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research and the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine.

The infusion rate of propofol was adjusted using a target-controlled infusion pump to achieve appropriate sedation levels under monitoring bispectral index of the electroencepharogram. Hepatic and renal functions were evaluated using common serum markers, which were determined using standard hospital laboratory methods. RESULTS: The duration of the procedure was 65.5 +/- 5.5 (mean +/- SD) min. The required infusion rate was 8.66 +/- 1.50 mg.kg-1.hr-1.

It is often difficult to detect clefts on non-contrast MR and some fractures show a solid pattern distribution of injected cement without a cleft sign on non-contrast MR. In this study, we evaluated usefulness of fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced MR to predict a solid pattern distribution of injected cement on PVP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with 35 vertebral compression fractures due to osteoporosis were studied. We performed sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images prior to PVP. First we evaluated the presence of fluid-filled or gas-containing clefts on non-contrast MR. Next we evaluated contrast-enhanced MR of the same vertebrae for the presence of cleft-shaped unenhanced areas within the diffuse enhancement area. We correlated MR findings with cement distribution patterns of injected cement. RESULTS: Based on MR findings, 35 osteoporotic fractures were divided into 3 types. Type 1 (11 fractures, 31%): There were no clefts on non-contrast MR and no unenhanced areas on contrast-enhanced MR; Type 2 (13, 37%): There were no clefts on non-contrast MR but there were unenhanced areas on contrast-enhanced MR; Type 3 (13, 37%): There were clefts on non-contrast MR and unenhanced areas on contrast-enhanced MR. Of 35 osteoporotic fractures, thirteen vertebral fractures (37%) were noted to contain clefts on non-contrast MR, while 24 vertebral fractures (69%) contained unenhanced areas on contrast-enhanced MR. Cement distributed as a solid pattern within clefts or unenhanced areas in all fractures with them. CONCLUSION: Fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced MR is useful to predict a solid pattern distribution of injected cement prior to PVP.",eng,1.0

The responsible level of acute single level VCF was easily diagnosed with T1, T2, and fat sat T2 but the responsible level of acute multi-level VCFs was not easily determined. BKP was performed at the most accumulated level on bone scintigraphy and the preoperative and postoperative Visual analogue score (VAS) scores were researched with questionnaire postoperatively. RESULTS: BKP was effective in relief of pain at the most accumulated level on bone scintigraphy. Preoperative VAS score (average 8.6) was significantly improved at post-ope day1 (average 3.9), at discharge (average 2.4) and at 1 month after discharge (average 2.1). New symptomatic VCFs after the first treatment occurred in 5 patients at an adjacent level in 3 and twice in 2 of 5 and additional BKP was effective in each patient. CONCLUSIONS: The correct level of symptomatic VCF in the patients with acute multi-level VCFs should be diagnosed to achieve good clinical results. In this study, we showed that bone scintigraphy is very useful in diagnosing the proper level for BKP in addition to CT and MRI.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,J. L. Old; M. Calvert,2004.0,Vertebral compression fractures in the elderly,", ","Compression fracture of the vertebral body is common, especially in older adults. Vertebral compression fractures usually are caused by osteoporosis, and range from mild to severe. More severe fractures can cause significant pain, leading to inability to perform activities of daily living, and life-threatening decline in the elderly patient who already has decreased reserves. While the diagnosis can be suspected from history and physical examination, plain roentgenography, as well as occasional computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, are often helpful in accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Traditional conservative treatment includes bed rest, pain control, and physical therapy. Interventional procedures such as vertebroplasty can be considered in those patients who do not respond to initial treatment. Family physicians can help patients prevent compression fractures by diagnosing and treating predisposing factors, identifying high-risk patients, and educating patients and the public about measures to prevent falls.",eng,0.0

Reis,2016.0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty: a new animal model,10.1016/j.spinee.2016.06.011,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure and is frequently performed in humans who need surgical treatment of vertebral fractures. PVP involves cement injection into the vertebral body, thereby providing rapid and significant pain relief. PURPOSE: The testing of novel biomaterials depends on suitable animal models. The aim of this study was to develop a reproducible and safe model of PVP in sheep. STUDY DESIGN: This study used ex vivo and in vivo large animal model study (Merino sheep). METHODS: Ex vivo vertebroplasty was performed through a bilateral modified parapedicular access in 24 ovine lumbar hemivertebrae, divided into four groups (n=6). Cerament (Bone Support, Lund, Sweden) was the control material. In the experimental group, a novel composite was tested-Spine-Ghost-which consisted of an alpha-calcium sulfate matrix enriched with micrometric particles of mesoporous bioactive glass. All vertebrae were assessed by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and underwent mechanical testing. For the in vivo study, 16 sheep were randomly allocated into control and experimental groups (n=8), and underwent PVP using the same bone cements. All vertebrae were assessed postmortem by micro-CT, histology, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). This work has been supported by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme for collaborative projects (600,000-650,000 USD). RESULTS: In the ex vivo model, the average defect volume was 1,275.46+/-219.29 mm3. Adequate defect filling with cement was observed. No mechanical failure was observed under loads which were higher than physiological. In the in vivo study, cardiorespiratory distress was observed in two animals, and one sheep presented mild neurologic deficits in the hind limbs before recovering. CONCLUSIONS: The model of PVP is considered suitable for preclinical in vivo studies, mimicking clinical application. All sheep recovered and completed a 6-month implantation period. There was no evidence of cement leakage into the vertebral foramen in the postmortem examination.",eng,1.0

Duparc,2007.0,[Treatment of thoracolumbar junction burst fractures (Magerl A3) by balloon kyphoplasty: anatomic study],", ","PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Balloon kyphoplasty is a not widely used method for the treatment of vertebral burst fractures with displacement of the posterior wall. The purpose of this study was to measure the posterior height of the vertebral body and the posttraumatic canal surface area before and after balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of burst fractures (Magerl A3). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This anatomic study was conducted on ten experimental burst fractures of the thoracolumar junction prepared on cadaver specimens. The surface area of the canal and the height of the posterior wall were measured by computed tomography before and after balloon kyphoplasty. These two variables were then compared with search for correlation. RESULTS: The posttraumatic canal surface area increased significantly after kyphoplasty (p=0.02). Gain in posterior height was not significant and there was no correlation between the two variables. Cement leakage into the canal was not observed. DISCUSSION: It is known that balloon kyphoplasty can re-establish anterior height and correct for the posttraumatic kyphosis in patients with compression fractures of osteoporotic vertebrae. The present cadaver study shows that when the posterior wall is displaced posteriorly, balloon expansion does not exaggerate the wall displacement. On the contrary, the posttraumatic canal surface area is increased due to the ligamentotaxis effect. CONCLUSION: Balloon kyphoplasty could be an alternative to posterior instrumentation for burst fractures without associated neurological deficit, even if the posterior wall is damaged. This technique can be used to reduce and stabilize the fracture while sparing the adjacent levels and limiting the risk inherent with an extensive surgical approach.",fre,0.0

In those with refractory fractures, percutaneous cement augmentation has been suggested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome of percutaneous vertebroplasty in Iranian patients with refractory osteoporotic fractures. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 37 osteoporotic fractures in 28 patients (6 men and 22 women), who had been treated with vertebroplasty from August 2009 to June 2012. The mean follow-up period was 12.1+/-3.6 (range: 6-42 months). The patients' states were assessed by the visual analogue scale and short form-36 questionnaire. Student t test was used to analyze the pre- and postoperative data. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 71.6+/-6.1 (range: 50 to 91 years) and the most common fractured vertebrae were L1 and T12. There were five patients with two levels of vertebral fractures and two with three levels. Vertebroplasty could improve the scores for pain and quality of life from preoperative 7.6 +/- 1.4 and 44.8 +/- 7.6 to 1.8 +/- 0.4 and 74.1 +/- 5.3 at four weeks after surgery. At the last follow-up visit, this improvement continued with no significant decline. The most common complication was cement leakage (32.4% per vertebra), wherein all of of the patients were clinically asymptomatic. Adjacent vertebral fracture occurred in six cases. CONCLUSION: By understanding the risks, we propose vertebroplasty in Iranian patients with refractory osteoporotic vertebral fracture.

OBJECTIVE: To develop less invasive surgical techniques for reconstruction of the anterior column in thoracolumbar fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Persistent central endplate depression can cause anterior column insufficiency after posterior surgery for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. Reduction of the central endplate followed by intravertebral cement augmentation could restore weight-bearing capacity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In human cadaveric burst fracture models, balloon-assisted endplate reduction (BAER) and vertebroplasty techniques have been investigated in terms of their safety and biomechanical properties. The histologic properties of different cement polymers were studied in an animal vertebral body and endplate defect model. In addition, the clinical outcome of percutaneous cement augmentation in the setting of a burst fracture examining the BAER technique and vertebroplasty with adjunctive posterior pedicle screw fixation is reviewed. RESULTS: These techniques have proven to be safe and effective, although cement leakage outside the confines of the vertebral body may occur. Calcium phosphate cements are preferable over methylmethacrylate because of their in vivo histologic properties. Using the BAER technique and posterior pedicular fixation, anterior vertebral height restoration is possible. Following balloon removal, some loss of fracture height restoration is observed. Further loss of vertebral height reduction was not observed following cement curing clinically. CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that less invasive anterior vertebral reconstruction using percutaneous cement augmentation techniques is feasible following traumatic vertebral fractures.",eng,1.0

There were no significant differences in adjusted costs in the first 9 months postsurgery, but kyphoplasty patients were associated with significantly lower adjusted treatment costs by 6.8-7.9% in the remaining periods through 2 years postsurgery. INTRODUCTION: Vertebral augmentation has been shown to be safe and effective for treating vertebral compression fractures. Comparative cost studies of initial treatment costs for kypho- and vertebroplasty have been mixed. The purpose of our study was to compare the costs for treating kypho- and vertebroplasty patients at up to 2 years postsurgery. METHODS: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty patients diagnosed with pathologic or closed lumbar/thoracic vertebral fractures were identified from the 5% sample of the Medicare dataset (2006-2009). The final study cohort with at least 2 years follow-up comprised of 1,609 vertebroplasty and 2,878 kyphoplasty patients. The cumulative treatment costs (adjusted to June 2011 US$) were determined from the payer perspective. Differences in costs and length of stay were assessed by generalized linear mixed model regression, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: The average adjusted costs for vertebroplasty patients within the first quarter and the first 2 years postsurgery were $14,585 [95% confidence interval (CI), $14,109-15,078] and $44,496 (95% CI, $42,763-46,299), respectively. The corresponding average adjusted costs for kyphoplasty patients were $15,117 (95% CI, $14,752-15,491) and $41,339 (95% CI, $40,154-42,560). There were no significant differences in adjusted costs in the first 9 months postsurgery, but kyphoplasty patients were associated with significantly lower adjusted treatment costs by 6.8-7.9% in the remaining periods through 2 years postsurgery. CONCLUSION: Our present study addresses some of the limitations in previous comparative cost studies of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. The higher adjusted costs for vertebroplasty patients than kyphoplasty patients by 1 year following the surgery reflect greater utilization of medical resources.",eng,0.0

Momoi,2005.0,Development of the needle insertion robot for percutaneous vertebroplasty,", ","Percutaneous Vertebroplasty (PVP) is an effective and less invasive medical treatment for vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures. However, this operative procedure is quite difficult because an arcus vertebra, which is narrow, is needled with accuracy, and an operator's hand is exposed to X-ray continuously. We have developed a needle insertion robot for Percutaneous Vertebroplasty. Its experimental evaluation on the basic performance of the system and needle insertion accuracy are presented. A needle insertion robot is developed for PVP. This robot can puncture with accuracy and an operator does not need to be exposed to X-ray. The mechanism of the robot is compact in size (350 mm x D 400 mm x H270 mm, weight: 15 kg) so that the robot system can be inserted in the space between C-arm and the patient on the operating table. The robot system is controlled by the surgical navigation system where the appropriate needle trajectory is planned based on pre-operative three-dimensional CT images. The needle holding part of the robot is X-ray lucent so that the needle insertion process can be monitored by fluoroscopy. The position of the needle during insertion process can be continuously monitored. In vitro evaluation of the system showed that average position and orientation errors were less than 1.0 mm and 1.0 degree respectively. Experimental results showed that the safety mechanism called mechanical fuse released the needle holding disk properly when excessive force was applied to the needle. These experimental results demonstrated that the developed system has the satisfactory basic performance as needle insertion robot for PVP.",eng,0.0

However, after a vertebroplasty there is no chance to restore vertebral height. Using the technique of kyphoplasty a certain restoration of vertebral body height can be achieved. But there is a limitation of recovery due to loss of correction when deflating the kyphoplastic ballon and before injecting the cement. In addition, the instruments used are quite expensive. Lordoplasty is another technique to restore kyphosis by indirect fracture reduction as it is used with an internal fixateur. The fractured and the adjacent vertebrae are instrumented with bone cannulas bipediculary and the adjacent vertebrae are augmentated with cement. After curing of the cement the fractured vertebra is reduced by applying a lordotic moment via the cannulas. While maintaining the pretension the fractured vertebra is reinforced. We performed a prospective trial of 26 patients with a lordoplastic procedure. There was a pain relief of about 87% and a significant decrease in VAS value from 7.3 to 1.9. Due to lordoplasty there was a significant and permanent correction in vertebral and segmental kyphotic angle about 15.2 degrees and 10.0 degrees , respectively and also a significant restoration in anterior and mid vertebral height. Lordoplasty is a minimal invasive technique to restore vertebral body height. An immediate relief of pain is achieved in most patients. The procedure is safe and cost effective.",eng,0.0

PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of the antecedent unipedicular vertebrogram in predicting patterns of cement deposition to decide whether unipedicular vertebroplasty will be successful, or if a bipedicular vertebroplasty is needed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 75 fractured vertebral levels were injected by a unipedicle approach with iodinated contrast material (vertebrogram). This filling pattern was then compared to the cement deposition pattern, via the same pedicle, of the percutaneous vertebroplasty. RESULTS: 35 levels showed excellent cross-filling and matched pattern by vertebrogram and cement deposition (47%). Twelve levels (16%) showed cross-filling by both techniques, with less than 100% matched pattern, but cement deposition was considered adequate for fracture treatment. Four levels (5%) showed predominantly matched central filling, considered adequate for fracture treatment. Twenty-one levels (28%) showed only matched filling of half of the vertebral body with both techniques, necessitating a bipedicle approach for treatment with cement. The remaining three levels (4%) demonstrated mismatched patterns between the vertebrogram and the cement deposition, necessitating a bipedicular approach. CONCLUSION: The unipedicular vertebrogram was helpful in predicting adequate cement deposition, using a single pedicle, in 51 of 75 cases (68%). The vertebrogram was also accurate in predicting the need for a double-pedicle technique in an additional 21 cases (28%). Therefore, the vertebrogram was very helpful in predicting the route of cement deposition in 72 of 75 (96%) cases, and should be considered as an adjunct to percutaneous vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

We compared the exposure levels to an operator performing vertebral fracture augmentation with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, to assess a cement injection and a monitoring technique designed to reduce this exposure.
METHODS: A neuroradiologist performed 189 consecutive vertebral augmentation procedures in 135 patients with osteoporotic compression fractures by using a bilateral approach with biplane pulse fluoroscopy at 7.5 pulses/second. Cement delivery was performed with intermittent fluoroscopy with kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty by using syringes or continuous fluoroscopic monitoring with a cement delivery system (CDS). Data collection included time and operator exposure parameters.
RESULTS: A total of 87 kyphoplasty procedures, 82 vertebroplasty procedures with a CDS (VP-CDS), and 20 vertebroplasty procedures with syringes (VP-S) were safely performed. Mean fluoroscopy time for device positioning was 4.3 minutes for each procedure type. Mean fluoroscopy time (minutes) for cement delivery was significantly different for the 3 procedure types; 2.1 for kyphoplasty, 3.7 for VP-CDS, and 1.5 for VP-S (P < .0001).

The vertebral fracture model was prepared by punching a hole in the center of the vertebra and at 4 sites around the vertebra (5 holes in total) from the front side of the vertebra using an air drill and hollowing the holes. Measurements were made on healthy vertebrae, vertebrae from the vertebral fracture model, vertebrae removed from animals immediately after vertebroplasty, vertebrae collected 1 and 2 months after vertebroplasty, and vertebrae untreated for 1 month after vertebral fracture. Histological examinations were also performed 1 and 2 weeks and 1 and 2 months after vertebroplasty with hydroxyapatite blocks. The strength of vertebrae in the fracture model immediately after vertebroplasty was significantly higher than that in the untreated fracture, and the strength of vertebrae 1 month after the procedure was equivalent to that of healthy vertebrae. Histologically, new bone formation was found around hydroxyapatite blocks 2 weeks after the procedure, and strong crosslinking between neighboring hydroxyapatite blocks was found after 1 month.These results suggest that hydroxyapatite blocks may be effective as filling material for vertebral fracture from both biomechanical and histological perspectives.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,M. D. Osterhouse; N. W. Kettner,2002.0,Delayed posttraumatic vertebral collapse with intravertebral vacuum cleft,", ","OBJECTIVE: To discuss the case of a 79-year-old man who had a delayed posttraumatic vertebral collapse and an intravertebral vacuum cleft. The patient had been on long-term corticosteroid therapy. A discussion of Kummell's disease and the controversy surrounding the etiology of the condition is also presented. CLINICAL FEATURES: Six weeks before coming to the clinic, the patient remembered twisting, hearing a pop, and having severe low back pain. Two weeks after the incident, while hospitalized for bacterial cellulitis, he underwent lumbar spine radiography. The radiographs showed degenerative changes and remote (healed) compression fractures but did not demonstrate any deformity of L2. Four weeks later, he sought care for persistent low back pain. Radiographs revealed marked compression of the L2 vertebral body with an intravertebral vacuum phenomenon. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient was referred to his geriatrician for evaluation as a candidate for vertebroplasty or other stabilization procedures. He required a moderately high dose (60 mg) of prednisone daily to combat the symptoms of myasthenia gravis; therefore, the prognosis appears unfavorable for this patient. CONCLUSION: Clinical research is needed to determine the definitive etiology and pathophysiology of Kummell's disease. This case demonstrates that the intravertebral vacuum is a dynamic entity, subject to changes in size and shape. Previous case reports have suggested that Kummell's disease only presents as a linear, horizontal cleft. This disease needs further investigation to determine the true correlation between radiographic signs and the underlying pathophysiology.",eng,0.0

Villa,2016.0,Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for the treatment of thoracic fractures in osteoporotic patients: a finite element comparative analysis,10.5301/jabfm.5000287,"BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures occur in the thoracolumbar junction, causing the collapse of the vertebral body. For their treatment, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are used, but it is still unknown which technique is to be preferred. METHODS: Finite element models of the thoracic spine were developed to evaluate the outcomes of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. A mild and severe collapse of T10 treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty was studied. Stresses on the endplates and intradiscal pressures were extrapolated to determine the stress distribution in the adjacent structures. RESULTS: The validation ensured a correct stiffness and a proper kinematic of each functional spinal unit. The results demonstrated that a consolidation following vertebroplasty caused slight variations of intradiscal pressures and stresses. If a kyphoplasty was performed after a mild collapse of the vertebral body, a 25% stress reduction on endplates was found. In cases of severe collapse, when a partial height restoration was achieved, a 15% stress reduction was obtained, while with a full recovery of the anterior wall of the collapsed vertebra, there was a further reduction of 40%. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the stresses on the adjacent endplates and the risk of fracture, the results suggest a kyphoplasty is to be preferred, trying to restore the initial vertebral body height.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of safety and effectiveness of the Kiva System in comparison to balloon kyphoplasty on the basis of matched pairs. METHODS: 52 patients (47 - 89 years, 68 fractures) were treated with balloon kyphoplasty or with the new Kiva System. Back pain and impairment of motility were assessed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively, with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The operation time and cement extravasation were recorded. Control radiographs were evaluated for new fractures and vertebral heights. RESULTS: Mean VAS values in both groups improved from preoperatively 87.6 +/- 12.8 and 83.1 +/- 14.9 to 10.8 +/- 20.8 and 24.6 +/- 11.0 6 months after the treatment. The improvement after 6 months in the Kiva group was significantly better than in the balloon kyphoplasty group (P < 0.0001). Mean ODI scores in both groups also improved from 68.7% +/- 15.8% in the Kiva group and 80.6% +/- 8.6% in the balloon kyphoplasty group preoperatively to 24.8 +/- 18.6% and 33.2 +/- 6.3% 6 months after treatment. The mean operation time for the Kiva group was 12.7 +/- 3.7 minutes per vertebra and cement leakage occurred in 6 patients. The mean operation time for the balloon kyphoplasty group was 34.1 +/- 7.0 minutes per vertebra and cement leakage occurred in 8 patients. Anterior and mid vertebral height in the Kiva group increased from preoperatively 21.06 +/- 7.44 mm and 18.36 +/- 5.64 mm to postoperatively 22.41 +/- 7.14 mm and 20.41 +/- 6.00 mm. Anterior and mid vertebral height in the balloon kyphoplasty group increased from preoperatively 21.68 +/- 2.06 mm and 21.97 +/- 1.78 mm to postoperatively 25.09 +/- 2.54 mm and 25.29 +/- 2.10 mm. Vertebral height restoration could be therefore maintained with both procedures for 6 months. In the Kiva group 2 cases of nonadjacent fractures and one case of adjacent fractures were observed. In the balloon kyphoplasty group 9 cases of adjacent, as well as 5 cases of nonadjacent, fractures were observed. In the Kiva group significant fewer fractures occurred. LIMITATIONS: The study includes only 26 patients for each procedure, which were compared on the basis of matched pairs. CONCLUSION: The Kiva System appears to be a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. Six months after treatment with the Kiva System, better VAS values than the values after the treatment with balloon kyphoplasty were recorded. Reduction in functional impairment was as successful as it was after balloon kyphoplasty. Vertebral height restoration was observed in both groups, which was sustained for 6 months. The risk of cement extravasation during the Kiva Treatment is nearly the same as in balloon kyphoplasty; however, it requires a shorter operation time and produces less new fractures.",eng,0.0

Patients with osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures are at risk for future compression fractures at adjacent levels, especially after cement augmentation. The purpose of this technical report is to describe the utilization of a cortical screw trajectory along with kyphoplasty for a patient with an osteoporotic compression fracture as well as degenerative spinal disease. This trajectory allows for the possibility of percutaneous pedicle access in the event of future compression fractures. Our patient underwent a decompressive laminectomy and kyphoplasty at the level of an osteoporotic compression fracture. The fracture was stabilized with cortical screw instrumentation and fusion at a level above and a level below the fracture. Subsequently the patient developed an adjacent level fracture within the fusion construct. Due to the utilization of a cortical screw trajectory for the initial fusion, the traditional pedicle trajectory was still accessible. As a result, the new fracture was treated with a percutaneous kyphoplasty through a standard pedicle trajectory. In conclusion, the use of a cortical screw trajectory for stabilization of osteoporotic compression fractures provides for a stronger bone screw interface and avoids osteoporotic trabecular vertebral body bone. At the same time this trajectory allows for future percutaneous pedicular access in the event that the patient suffers future compression fractures.",eng,0.0

Banczerowski,2015.0,[Treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with PMMA-augmented pedicle screw fixation],", ","BACKGROUND: Over the last few decades many innovative operation technique were developed due to the increase of porotic vertebral fractures. These new techniques aim to reach the required stability of the vertebral column. In case of significant instability, spinal canal stenosis or neural compression, decompressive intervention may be necessary, which results in further weakening of the column of the spine, the minimal invasive percutan vertebroplasty is not an adequate method to reach the required stability, that is why insertion of complementary pedicular screws is needed. Considering the limited screw-fixing ability of the porotic bone structure, with this new technique we are able to reach the appropriate stability of cement-augmented pedicle screws by dosing cement carefully through the screws into the vertebral body. We used this technique in our Institute in case of 12 patients and followed up the required stability and the severity of complications. METHODS: Fifteen vertebral compression fractures of 12 patients were treated in our Institute. Using the classification proposed by Genant et al. we found that the severity of the vertebral compression was grade 3 in case of 13, while grade 2 in case of two fractures. The average follow up time of the patients was 22 months (12-39), during this period X-ray, CT and clinical control examinations were taken. During the surgery the involved segments were localised by using X-ray and after the exploration the canulated screws were put through the pedicles of the spine and the vertebral body was filled through the transpedicular screws with bone cement. Depending on the grade of the spinal canal stenosis, we made the decompression, vertebroplasty or corpectomy of the fractured vertebral body, and the replacement of the body. Finally the concerned segments were fixed by titanium rods. RESULTS: In all cases the stenosis of spinal canal was resolved and the bone cement injected into the corpus resulted in adequated stability of the spine. In case of six patients we observed cement extravasation without any clinical signs, and by one patient--as a serious complication--pulmonary embolism. Neurological progression or screw loosening were not detected during the follow up period. Part of the patients had residual disability after the surgery due to their older ages and the problem of their rehabilitation process. CONCLUSION: After the right consideration of indications, age, general health condition and the chance of successful rehabilitation, the technique appears to be safe for the patients. With the use of this surgical method, the stability of the spine can be improved compared to the preoperative condition, the spinal canal stenosis can be solved and the neural structures can be decompressed. The severity of complications can be reduced by a precise surgical technique and the careful use of the injected cement. The indication of the surgical method needs to be considered in the light of the expected outcome and the rehabilitation.",hun,0.0

A non-modified calcium phosphate bone cement and collagen-calcium phosphate bone cements composites with enhanced mechanical properties, utilising either bovine collagen or collagen from a marine sponge, were compared to a commercial poly(methyl methacrylate) cement. Conical cement samples (8mm heightx4mm base diameter) were press-fit into distal femoral condyle defects in New Zealand White rabbits and assessed after 5 and 10 weeks. Bone apposition and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity around cements were assessed. All implants were well tolerated, but bone apposition was higher on calcium phosphate bone cements than on poly(methyl methacrylate) cement. Incorporation of collagen showed no evidence of inflammatory or immune reactions. Presence of positive tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining within cracks formed in calcium phosphate bone cements suggested active osteoclasts were present within the implants and were actively remodelling within the cements. Bone growth was also observed within these cracks. These findings confirm the biological advantages of calcium phosphate bone cements over poly(methyl methacrylate) and, coupled with previous work on enhancement of mechanical properties through collagen incorporation, suggest collagen-calcium phosphate bone cement composite may offer an alternative to calcium phosphate bone cements in applications where low setting times and higher mechanical stability are important.",English,0.0

The incorporation of collagen, both bovine and from a marine sponge (Chondrosia reniformis), into a CPC was investigated. The biological properties of the CPC and collagen-CPC composites were assessed in vitro through the use of human bone marrow stromal cells. Cytotoxicity, proliferation, and osteoblastic differentiation were evaluated using lactate dehydrogenase, PicoGreen, and alkaline phosphatase activity assays, respectively. The addition of both types of collagen resulted in an increase in cytotoxicity, albeit not to a clinically relevant level. Cellular proliferation after 1, 7, and 14 days was unchanged. The osteogenic potential of the CPC was reduced through the addition of bovine collagen but remained unchanged in the case of the marine collagen. These findings, coupled with previous work showing that incorporation of marine collagen in this way can improve the physical properties of CPCs, suggest that such a composite may offer an alternative to CPCs in applications where low setting times and higher mechanical stability are important.

Moro,2014.0,Patient radiation exposure during different kyphoplasty techniques,10.1093/rpd/nct214,"The scope of this study was to quantify patient radiation exposure during two different techniques of kyphoplasty (KP), which differ by a cement delivery method, in order to assess whether or not one of the two used methods can reduce the patient dose. Twenty patients were examined for this investigation. One X-ray fluoroscopy unit was used for localization, navigation and monitoring of cement delivery. The patient biometric data, the setting of the fluoroscope, the exposure time and the kerma-area product (KAP) were monitored in all the procedures for anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LL) fluoroscopic projections in order to assess the range of radiation doses imparted to the patient. Theoretical entrance skin dose (ESD) and effective dose (E) were calculated from intraoperatively measured KAP. An average ET per procedure was 1.5+/-0.5 min for the manual injection technique (study A) and 1.4+/-0.4 min for the distance delivery technique (study B) in the AP plane, while 3.2+/-0.7 and 5.1+/-0.6 min in the lateral plane, respectively. ESD was estimated as an average of 0.10+/-0.06 Gy for study A and 0.13+/-0.13 Gy for study B in the AP or/and 0.59+/-0.46 and 1.05+/-0.36 Gy in the lateral view, respectively. The cumulative mean E was 1.9+/-1.0 mSv procedure(-1) for study A and 3.6+/-0.9 mSv procedure(-1) for study B. Patient radiation exposure and associated effective dose from KP may be considerable. The technique of distance cement delivery appears to be slower than the manual injection technique and it requires a more protracted fluoroscopic control in the lateral projection, so that this system entails a higher amount of dose to the patient.",eng,0.0

Nevertheless, unilateral kyphoplasty would be an attractive alternative to the traditional bipedicular kyphoplasty owing to theoretical speed, safety, and less expense; thus far, the biomechanical testing showed that experimental unilateral kyphoplasty had properties comparable with bipedicular kyphoplasty. To date, no clinical data are available regarding the efficacy and safety of unilateral balloon kyphoplasty. In this prospective observational study, the clinical and radiographic outcomes of the unipedicular (unilateral) balloon kyphoplasty in osteoporotic VCFs are evaluated. METHODS: Three hundred and seventeen kyphoplasty procedures were performed in 142 patients with osteoporotic VCFs using the unilateral technique. This technique involves the unilateral cannulation of the center of the vertebral body and the placement of a single balloon tamp. To evaluate improvement in pain and physical function, preoperative and postoperative scores of visual analog scale (VAS), SF-36, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were compared at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Complications related to the procedure and cement extravasation rates were recorded. Height restoration and overall coronal and sagittal spinal alignment were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: Significant improvement on the VAS, SF-36 scores, and ODI was noted at 3 months postoperatively; these results were preserved at the 12-month follow-up for the 30 patients who completed the SF-36 questionnaire (VAS/ODI scores were available only for 19 of the 30 patients also showing sustained improvement). No complication was recorded; 34 cases (10.73%) of cement extravasation were all asymptomatic. Mean middle height restoration was found 48.9%; when vertebral levels treated were stratified into 2 groups, with or without height restoration (90.1% and 9.9% of all levels, respectively), corrected mean middle height restoration was found 54%. No lateral wedging or changes in the coronal alignment was observed in the unipedicular group. CONCLUSIONS: Unipedicular (unilateral) extrapedicular kyphoplasty is both a safe and efficacious alternative to the traditional bipedicular kyphoplasty for the treatment of painful osteoporotic VCFs. As a technique, it is faster, less expensive, and involves less radiation exposure for the surgical suite personnel.",eng,0.0

Vertebral fractures are underdiagnosed despite their high prevalence in both men and women. Clinical consequences of vertebral fractures include increased risk of future vertebral and hip fracture, acute and chronic back pain, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Patients with vertebral fractures have functional impairment and increased mortality similar to those with hip fractures. Asymptomatic fractures identified on radiograph also affect quality of life and mortality. A vertebral fracture is a clinical marker for a subsequent fracture and should trigger assessment and diagnosis of osteoporosis. The care of patients with vertebral fractures includes pain management, rehabilitation, and prevention of further fractures.

Higher class evidence now supports offering balloon kyphoplasty to a patient with cancer, provided that the pain is significant in intensity, has a positional character, and correlates to the area of the fractured vertebrae. Absence of clinical spinal cord compression and overt instability are paramount. Because of the frequent disruption of the posterior vertebral body cortex in these patients, the procedure should be performed by experienced operators who could also quickly perform an open decompression if cement extravasation occurs. Patients will benefit from vertebral augmentation, even in chronic malignant fractures.

There is a wide spectrum of therapeutic options: major en bloc resections in primary or oligometastatic disease; decompression and fusion in non-radiosensitive tumors with cord compression followed by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT); kyphoplasty/ vertebroplasty for stable compression fractures or minimally invasive corpectomy for more unstable fractures and RT- only for radiosensitive tumors not causing overt instability. Radiation therapy has always been essential component of the treatment algorithm although it has been displaced from principal treatment modality in the last 2 decades.

The aim of this analysis is to determine the subset of patients that may not benefit from surgical intervention and find the optimal intervention time. METHODS: 27 prospective multiple-arm studies with cohorts of more than 20 patients were included in this meta-analysis. We hereby report the results from the metaregression and subset analysis of those trials reporting on treatment of osteoporotic fractures with kyphoplasty and/or vertebroplasty. RESULTS: Early intervention (first 7 weeks after fracture) yielded more pain relief. However, spontaneous recovery was encountered in hyperacute fractures (less than 2 weeks old). Patients suffering from thoracic fractures or severely deformed vertebrae tended to report inferior results. We also attempted to formulate a treatment algorithm. CONCLUSION: Intervention in the hyperacute period should not be pursued, while augmentation after 7 weeks yields less consistent results. In cases of thoracic fractures and significant vertebral collapse, surgeons or interventional radiologists may resort earlier to operation and be less conservative, although those parameters need to be addressed in future randomized trials.",eng,0.0

The purpose of this review is to resolve the controversial issues raised by the two randomized trials that claimed no difference between VP and SHAM procedure. In particular we compare nonsurgical management (NSM) and KP and VP, in terms of clinical parameters (pain, disability, quality of life, and new fractures), cost-effectiveness, radiological variables (kyphosis correction and vertebral height restoration), and VP versus KP for cement extravasation and complications profile. Cement types and optimal filling are analyzed and technological innovations are presented. Finally unipedicular/bipedicular techniques are compared. Conclusion. VP and KP are superior to NSM in clinical and radiological parameters and probably more cost-effective. KP is superior to VP in sagittal balance improvement and cement leaking. Complications are rare but serious adverse events have been described, so caution should be exerted. Unilateral procedures should be pursued whenever feasible.

METHODS: A critical review of the medical literature was performed and controversial issues were analyzed. RESULTS: Evidence supports KP as the treatment of choice to control fracture pain and the possible restoration of sagittal balance, provided that no overt instability or myelopathy is present, the fracture is painful and other pain generators have been excluded, and positive radiological findings are present. Unilateral procedures yield similar results to bilateral ones and should be pursued whenever feasible. Biopsy should be routinely performed and 3 to 4 levels may be augmented in a single operation. Higher cement filling appears to yield better results. Radiotherapy is complementary with KP and VP but must be individualized. CONCLUSIONS: In cases of painful cancer fractures, if overt instability or myelopathy is not present, unilateral KP should be pursued, whenever feasible, followed by radiotherapy. The technological advances in hardware and biomaterials, as well as combining KP with other modalities, will help ensure a safe and more effective procedure. Address.",eng,0.0

METHODS: As of February 1, 2011, a PubMed search (key words: kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty) resulted in 1,587 articles out of which 27 met basic selection criteria (prospective multiple-arm studies with cohorts of >/= 20 patients). This systematic review adheres to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Pain reduction in both BKP (-5.07/10 points, P < 0.01) and VP (-4.55/10, P < 0.01) was superior to that for NSM (-2.17/10), while no difference was found between BKP/VP (P = 0.35). Subsequent fractures occurred more frequently in the NSM group (22 %) compared with VP (11 %, P = 0.04) and BKP (11 %, P = 0.01). BKP resulted in greater kyphosis reduction than VP (4.8 masculine vs. 1.7 degrees , P < 0.01). Quality of life (QOL) improvement showed superiority of BKP over VP (P = 0.04), along with a trend for disability improvement (P = 0.08). Cement extravasation was less frequent in the BKP (P = 0.01). Surgical intervention within the first 7 weeks yielded greater pain reduction than VCFs treated later. CONCLUSIONS: BKP/VP provided greater pain relief and fewer subsequent fractures than NSM in osteoporotic VCFs. BKP is marginally favored over VP in disability improvement, and significantly favored in QOL improvement. BKP had a lower risk of cement extravasation and resulted in greater kyphosis correction. Despite this analysis being restricted to Level I and II studies, significant heterogeneity suggests that the current literature is delivering inconsistent messages and further trials are needed to delineate confounding variables.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Fifty-three patients with axial back pain from osteoporotic compression fracture were enrolled. The clinical outcomes were measured by Verbal Numeric Rating Scale (VNS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) before treatment, 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months after the medial branch block. Radiographic analysis included measurement of overall sagittal alignment, collapsed vertebral height, and vertebral kyphotic angle. After 12 months, patients' satisfaction was classified to five categories: excellent, good, fair, poor or fail. Statistical analysis of both radiographic and clinical parameters along with treatment outcome was performed to determine any significant correlations between the two. RESULTS: VNS and ODI was improved 2 weeks after the injection and continued to improve until 12 months.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing appropriate acute lesions before a percutaneous cement augmentation technique. BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures related to osteoporosis are very common in the elderly. Acute OVCFs are usually treated conservatively. In recent years, minimally invasive percutaneous cement augmentation techniques, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have been introduced as alternative treatment options. However, the localization of acute fractures of the spine can be difficult, yet is critical in implementing these treatments. METHODS: A total of 168 patients were enrolled in this study. All participants were 50 years of age or older and were admitted via the emergency room because of acute severe back pain with suspected OVCFs with or without a history of trauma. Standard plain radiographs and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the spine were initially obtained in the emergency room. An MRI scan with short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequencing of the spine was performed within 3 days of hospitalization. Patients were divided into 2 groups: single group and multiple group. The single group consisted of those with a single fracture, and the multiple group consisted of those with multiple fractures of the vertebral body, as diagnosed using only standard radiographs and CT scans. We compared the level and number of fractures from the initial findings of the standard radiographs and CT scans with the MRI scan results within each group. RESULTS: The mean age of the study participants was 68.9 years. Forty-nine patients were male and 119 were female. In the single group, the concordance rate of diagnosis was 77% (97/125) and the discordance rate was 23% (28/125). In the multiple group, the discordance rate was 65% (28/43). There was a significantly higher rate of misdiagnosis in the multiple group compared with the single group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: MRI with STIR sequencing exhibited a multitude of benefits in the exact identification of acute lesions and hidden lesions. Because of the high rate of misdiagnosis using standard plain radiographs and CT scans of the spine for OVCFs, MRI with STIR sequencing should be considered before cement augmentation procedures. Moreover, in cases with multiple lesions or severe osteoporosis, the importance of MRI should be further emphasized.",eng,0.0

Literature described cement leakage causing neurological injury mainly after vertebroplasty procedure; only a few case reports show cement leakage with kyphoplasty without neurological injury or proper cause of leakage. We present a report two cases of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture treated with kyphoplasty and developed cement leakage causing significant neurological injury. In both cases CT scan was the diagnostic tool to identify cause of cement leakage. CT scan exhibited violation of medial pedicle wall causing cement leakage in the spinal canal. Both patients displayed clinical improvement after decompression surgery with or without instrumentation. Retrospectively looking at stored fluoroscopic images, we found that improper position of trocar in AP and lateral view simultaneously while taking entry caused pedicle wall violation. We suggest not to cross medial pedicle wall in AP image throughout the entire procedure and keeping the trocar in the center of pedicle in lateral image would be the most important precaution to prevent such complication. Our case reports adds the neurological complications with kyphoplasty procedure and suggested that along with other precautions described in the literature, entry with trocar along the entire procedure keeping the oval shape of pedicle in mind (under C-arm) will probably help to prevent such complications.",eng,0.0

Ferreira,2017.0,An overview of clinical guidelines for the management of vertebral compression fracture: a systematic review,10.1016/j.spinee.2017.07.174,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Vertebral compression fractures are the most common type of osteoporotic fracture comprising approximately 1.4 million cases worldwide. Clinical practice guidelines can be powerful tools for promoting evidence-based practice, as they integrate research findings in order to support decision-making. However, currently available clinical guidelines and recommendations, established by different medical societies, are sometimes contradictory. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to appraise the recommendations and methodological quality of international clinical guidelines for the management of VCFs. STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review of clinical guidelines for the management of vertebral compression fracture. METHODS: Guidelines were selected by searching MEDLINE and PubMed, PEDro, CINAHL and EMBASE electronic databases between 2010 and 2016. We also searched clinical practice guideline databases, including the National Guideline Clearinghouse and the Canadian Medical Association InfoBase. The methodological quality of the guidelines was assessed by two authors independently, using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) Instrument. We also classified the strength of each recommendation as either: strong (i.e. based on high quality studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention); weak (i.e based on lack of compelling evidence resulting in uncertainty for benefit or potential harm); or expert Consensus (i.e. based on expert opinion of the working group rather than scientific evidence). Guideline recommendations were grouped into diagnostic, conservative care, interventional care and osteoporosis treatment/prevention of future fractures. Our study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. All authors have declared: no support from any organisation for the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organisations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; any other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work RESULTS: Four guidelines, from three countries, published in the period 2010 - 2013 were included. In general, the quality was not satisfactory (50% or less of the maximum possible score). The domains scoring 50% or less of the maximum possible score were rigor of development, clarity of presentation and applicability. Use of plain radiography or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for diagnosis was recommended in two of the four guidelines. Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty were recommended in 3 of the 4 guidelines. The recommendation for bed rest, trunk orthoses, electrical stimulation and supervised or unsupervised exercise was inconsistent across included guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of clinical guidelines for the management of VCF showed that diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations were generally inconsistent. The evidence available to guideline developers was limited in quantity and quality. Greater efforts are needed to improve the quality of the majority of guidelines.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to document a series of cases of neurologic deficit following percutaneous vertebral stabilization, to identify patterns of neurologic injury, and to describe potential methods for avoiding these injuries. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebral stabilization procedures, including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have become a widely used for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, primary and metastatic vertebral tumors, and traumatic burst fractures. Despite an increasing array of indications, there have been few reports of adverse events. Neurologic complications associated with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been described previously as case reports and have generally been considered as infrequent and minor in severity. METHODS: The clinical course of 14 patients with documented loss of neurologic function following percutaneous vertebral cement augmentation was retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: The average patient age was 74.9 years (range, 46-88 years) with 3 male and 11 female patients. Four patients underwent a vertebroplasty procedure while 10 were treated with kyphoplasty. Six patients developed neurologic deficits acutely (<24 hours of procedure). The remaining 8 patients developed neurologic symptoms at an average of 37.1 days (range, 3-112 days) postprocedure. Neurologic deficits were recorded as ASIA A in 4 patients, ASIA B in 2 patients, ASIA C in 1 patient, and ASIA D in 7 patients. Twelve of 14 patients (85.7%) required revision open surgical intervention for treatment of their neurologic injury. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been reported to be safe options for the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Although complications are infrequent, there remains the potential for catastrophic neurologic injury. Physicians performing these procedures need to be aware of these potential complications and be prepared to respond in an emergent manner (surgically) if a need arises.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,N. Patel,2010.0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty: role in treatment of vertebral compression fractures,10.1016/j.pmr.2010.07.001,"Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder. Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are a significant cause of back pain. Pain after VCF can be attributed to incomplete healing and progressive collapse of the bone. Conservative management has been the historical treatment option for patients with painful percutaneous vertebroplasties (PVs). Although seemingly harmless, conservative treatment can be risky for elderly patients suffering from VCFs. PV can be used to treat VCFs in some patients. The exact mechanism of pain relief by vertebroplasty is not understood; the pain relief is probably because of improved vertebral body strength and stiffness and decreasing motion of the vertebral body and periosteal and interosseous nerves. But, PV is not without risks. Therefore, until further studies show that PV is superior to conservative treatment, with equivalent complications profile, PV should be reserved for patients who have failed conservative treatment.",eng,0.0

Group 1 mini open vertebroplasty (N = 10) no neurologic deficits and kyphotic deformity, but with intravertebral instability and significant radiological spinal canal compromise. Group 2 with neurologic deficits (N = 24) (2A)-transpedicular decompression (TPD) with instrumentation (N = 14). Fracture morphology similar to (1) and localized kyphosis <30 degrees (2B)-pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) with instrumentation (N = 10). Fracture morphology similar to (1) and local kyphosis >30 degrees . Group 3 posterolateral decompression with interbody reconstruction (N = 06) endplate(s) destroyed, with instability at discovertebral junction, with neurologic deficit.

METHODS: Out of 540 levels treated in 260 patients, we treated 40 patients (mean age: 74 years) with vertebra plana between T6 and L3 (37 osteoporotic and 3 metastatic levels). In most cases, the vertebra was accessed with fluoroscopic guidance from a single, transpedicular approach. All patients underwent a preliminary MRI examination, an immediate, post-procedure radiological examination, and a follow-up examination (mean duration, 6 months). RESULTS: Both immediate and follow-up examinations showed that the mean pain and physical disability scores were significantly reduced compared to the scores before treatment (p </= 0.001). No complications occurred during the procedures. In 23/40 cases, asymptomatic intradiscal cement leakage occurred. Posterior or perivertebral leakage never occurred. In most cases, an intravertebral cleft was present, and we filled it with polymethylmethacrylate, which healed the pseudarthrosis. Partial vertebral height was restored in 7 cases. In 6 cases, a new fracture occurred between 1 and 3 months at a different level from the treated level. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results showed that PVP was a safe, effective treatment for symptomatic vertebra plana; thus, it should not be discounted for this group of patients. In most cases, the procedure was favored by the presence of an intravertebral cleft that appeared to contribute to minimizing the risk of posterior cement leakage. Filling the cleft with polymethylmethacrylate allowed intravertebral stabilization.",eng,1.0

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness, complications and progress of results of PVP optimized in terms of technique, costs, time and strategic protocol after 3 years of procedures performed under fluoroscopic guidance alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We treated 250 VCFs in 120 consecutive patients after assessing clinical and radiological indications. The effectiveness of the procedure was determined by statistical analysis of numerical scores for pain, mobility and drug consumption before and after treatment. RESULTS: No major complications and only three minor complications occurred. Clinically relevant improved mobility and reduction of pain and analgesics were observed, with overall significant results (p<0.0001) in all patients at 24 h after PVP and in 83 available patients at 6 months. A total of five asymptomatic refractures of cemented vertebrae and 14 new symptomatic vertebral fractures at different levels were observed between 1 and 10 months after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: PVP is a safe, rapid, effective and costeffective therapy for VCFs, requiring only brief hospital admission and with long-lasting clinical results, when performed under good-quality radiological guidance, when correct indications are respected and when it is associated with rehabilitation therapy in the follow-up. It is a valid alternative to conservative therapy, which is burdened by high healthcare costs and often requires long-term immobilisation of frail and elderly patients at risk of clinical complications.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 155 patients, 310 percutaneous vertebroplasties were performed during 25 months and 15 days. Of these, 37 patients (27 women, 10 men; mean age, 73.6 years) underwent 48 vertebroplasties for severe osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures. The fractures were defined as vertebrae that have collapsed to less than one-third of their original height. Imaging and clinical features were analyzed, including the extent of vertebral collapse, location of the involved vertebra, pattern of vertebral compression, volume of polymethylmethacrylate injected, vertebroplasty complications, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Vertebral body collapse averaged 23% (range, 4.5%-33.0%) of the original height. Involved vertebrae were located from levels T5 to L5, with one-half affected at the thoracolumbar junction. Patterns of vertebral compression were divided into gibbus (31 of 48 or 65%), plana (13 of 48 or 27%), and H shape (four of 48 or 8%).

METHODS: Single-centre retrospective analysis of 58 consecutive patients who underwent 67 PSPs for intractable pain from sacral tumours (84.5 %) or from osteoporotic fractures (15.5 %). The following data were assessed: visual analogue scale (VAS) before and after the procedure for global pain; short-term (1-month) clinical follow-up using a four-grade patient satisfaction scale (worse, unchanged, mild improvement and significant improvement); modification in analgesics consumption; referred short-term walking mobility. Minor and major complications were systematically assessed. RESULTS: The mean VAS score was 5.3 +/- 2.0 in pre-procedure and 1.7 +/- 1.8 in post-procedure. At 1-month follow-up, 34/58 (58.5 %) patients experienced a mild improvement; 15/58 (26 %) presented a significant improvement while 4/58 (7 %) and 5/58 (8.5 %) patients had unchanged or worse pain, respectively. Decreased analgesic consumption was observed in 34 % (20/58) of the patients. Eighty percent of patients with walking limitation experienced improvement, 16 % remained unchanged and 4 % were worse. We noted minor complications in 2/58 patients (3.4 %) and major complications in 2/58 patients (3.4 %). CONCLUSION: Percutaneous sacroplasty for metastatic and osteoporotic fractures is a safe and effective technique in terms of pain relief and functional outcome. KEY POINTS: * Percutaneous sacroplasty provides pain relief and functional improvement for insufficiency sacral fractures. * Percutaneous sacroplasty provides pain relief and function improvement for sacral tumours. * The major complication rate is acceptable (3.4 %), and is higher in sacral tumours. * Posterior wall/cortical sacral bone disruption is not statistically associated with more complications. * However, osteolytic tumours seem to be associated with higher risk of complications.",eng,1.0

The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors related to the development of severe CBP in these subjects. We evaluated risk factors including visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline and during the 1-year follow-up, age, gender, symptom onset time, number, type and severity of VF at baseline, number of vertebral bodies treated, incident VF, and antiosteoporotic treatment, among others. CBP was considered in patients with VAS >/= 7 at 12 months. 91/125 patients completed the 12-months follow-up. CBP was observed in 23% of VP-treated patients versus 23% receiving CT. Patients developing CBP after VP showed a longer symptom onset time (82% >/= 4 months in VP vs. 40% in CT, P = 0.03). On univariate analysis, female gender (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.47-1.57, P < 0.0001), multiple acute VF (OR 1.79; 95% CI 1.71-1.87, P < 0.0001), VAS >/= 7 two months after treatment (OR 11.04; 95% CI 6.71-18.17, P < 0.0001), and type of antiosteoporotic drug (teriparatide) (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.03-0.60, P = 0.0236) were risk factors of CBP development in both groups. In the multivariate analysis, the main risk factors were baseline and post-treatment VAS >/= 7, longer symptom onset time, and type of antiosteoporotic treatment.

Journal Article,D. Perovic; I. Boric,2014.0,[Diagnostics and treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures],", ","Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, with vertebral compressive fractures (VCFs) that may occur as a consequence. Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) can lead to severe acute and chronic pain, impaired mobility, reduced quality of life and an increased risk of mortality due to decreased mobility and pulmonary dysfunction. When painful VCFs do come to clinical attention, they are typically treated with optimal pain management (OPM). Although the natural course of pain due to vertebral fractures decreases within the first weeks in the majority of patients, a number of them remain with persistent pain and/or ongoing vertebral collapse. Facet joint injections are an emerging procedure as possible treatment for a subgroup of patients with persistent pain after VCFs. In case of vertebral collapse or persistent pain after facet joint injections, patients have to be treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) or percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (BKP). PVP is a minimally invasive surgical procedure in which bone cement is injected into a fractured vertebra under radiological guidance using fluoroscopy. BKP is a variation of this approach, in which an inflatable balloon tamp is placed in the collapsed vertebra prior to cement injection, in order to create a cavity allowing low pressure injection. For peo- ple with painful osteoporotic VCFs refractory to analgesic treatment, PVP and BKP perform significantly better in unblinded trials than OPM in terms of improving quality of life and reducing pain and disability. It is possible that BKP and PVP may lead to reductions in mortality. In small subgroup of patients with neurological injury related to an osteoporotic fracture, different open surgical techniques were used to suit different fracture patterns, with good clinical and radiological results.",hrv,0.0

At the same time, development of minimal invasive spinal techniques using a percutaneous approach is greatly adapted to these fragile patients with a reduction in operative time and complications. The aim of this study was to report our experience with cemented percutaneous screws in the management of patients with a poor bone stock. METHODS: Thirty-five patients were included in this retrospective study. In each case, a percutaneous osteosynthesis using cemented screws was performed. Indications were osteoporotic fractures, metastasis or fractures on ankylosing spine. Depending on radiologic findings, short or long constructs (2 levels above and below) were performed and an anterior column support (kyphoplasty or anterior approach) was added. Evaluation of patients was based on pre and postoperative CT-scans associated with clinical follow-up with a minimum of 6 months. RESULTS: Eleven men and 24 women with a mean age of 73 years [60-87] were included in the study. Surgical indication was related to an osteoporotic fracture in 20 cases, a metastasis in 13 cases and a fracture on ankylosing spine in the last 2 cases. Most of the fractures were located between T10 and L2 and a long construct was performed in 22 cases. Percutaneous kyphoplasty was added in 24 cases and a complementary anterior approach in 3 cases. Average operative time was 86minutes [61-110] and blood loss was estimated as minor in all the cases. In the entire series, average volume of cement injected was 1.8 cc/screw. One patient underwent a major complication with a vascular leakage responsible for a cement pulmonary embolism. With a 9 months average follow-up [6-20], no cases of infection or mechanical complication was reported. CONCLUSION: Minimal invasive spinal techniques are greatly adapted to the management of fragile patients. The use of percutaneous cemented screws is, in our experience, a valuable alternative for spinal fixation in patients with poor bone stock. This technique allows a good bony fixation with a low rate of complications. However, rigorous preoperative planning is necessary in order to avoid complications.",fre,0.0

Differences in the achievement of pain reduction and restoration of the height of the vertebral body after balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) or radiofrequency-targeted vertebral augmentation (RF-TVA) were to be tested on a randomized population. METHODS: A total of 80 patients (f = 59; m = 21) with osteoporotic fractures of vertebral bodies were assigned to the groups BKP (n = 44) or RF-TVA (n = 36). The clinical analyses were compared peri- and postoperatively in a prospective study with an additional follow-up examination after 1 year. RESULTS: The operations for BKP were bipedicular in all cases; for RF-TVA, a bipedicular access was required in only five cases (14 %) (p>0.0001). There were confirmed differences with respect to the amount of cement used (ml) between the two groups (BKP = 4.9 +/- 1 vs. RFTVA= 3.4 +/- 1; p<0.001). In the BKP group, the angle of kyphosis was reduced by an average of 1.65 degrees and in the RF-TVA group by an average of 2.8 degrees by the operation. The analysis of the maximum VAS data showed a clear postoperative reduction in the intensity of pain of approximately 4.5 cm in each of the groups with no discernible difference. After 12 months, the majority of patients in both groups (BKP = 61 % vs. RF-TVA = 83 %) reported being free of pain when at rest without a significant difference(p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A certain superiority of RF-TVA with respect to pain relief, amount of cement required, savings of operating time and personnel, and greater safety with respect to cement leakage noted in this study are consistent with other published literature. The differences between the two methods in the frequency of subsequent postoperative fractures and the secondary loss of high restoration were encouraging regarding RF-TVA.",eng,0.0

DESIGN: Prospective study over the period of 1 year. SETTING: Level I Trauma Center. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: Twenty-five patients with osteoporosis (14 women and 11 men) and painful, traumatic A3-type fractures were treated with Balloon Kyphoplasty in combination with a short-segment posterior fixation (using the Universal Spine System). Twenty-one patients returned for their 1-year follow-up visit. X-rays were taken preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 3, 6, and 12 months' follow-up to evaluate vertebral height and local Cobb angle. Pain was measured using the self-reporting Visual Analogue pain Scale (VAS). Disability was measured using the Oswestry Disability questionnaire (ODI). RESULTS: The mean pain score (VAS) improved significantly from pretreatment to posttreatment from 7.8 +/- 2.2 (5.6-10) to 4.9 +/- 2.1 (2.8-8.0) (P < 0.001). It improved further to 2.9 +/- 1.4 (2.1-4.3) at 3 months and increased slightly after 1 year (3.8 +/- 1.9) (1.9-4.7).

In addition, the evaluations should help to clarify the differences in balloon kyphoplasty for patients with vertebral fractures concerning efficacy and safety in relation to the underlying diseases: osteoporosis, bone metastases or myeloma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to reposition the endplates of the vertebrae a balloon was inserted after placement of the working channels. After removal of the balloon, the resulting caverns were filled with PMMA. The radiological and clinical follow-up examinations were carried out over a period of up to 3 years. The clinical and radiological findings before and after treatment at specified visits were transferred to a statistical programme and evaluated. RESULTS: The comparisons of the postoperative results according to the initial diagnosis (metastases: n = 222, osteoporosis: n = 122, myeloma: n = 122) demonstrated significant differences with respect to the cement leakage (14 %, 5 %, 7.5 %), but in all cases without any clinical relevance. The small differences related to the reduction in pain intensity (VAS > 50 mm in each group) after surgery were up to 12 months with no clinical significance. Also in the Oswestry score no differences between the 3 groups were registered. In the case of osteoporosis patients, due to the lower starting position a more significant increase of vertebral body height could be achieved by the kyphoplasty than in the comparison groups of patients with metastases or myeloma (slashed circle 3.1 mm vs. 0.4-0.5 mm; P < 0.001). Consequently, the kyphosis angle decreased in the osteoporotic group also more strongly than in the comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is evident that the pain relief in the vast majority of cases started immediately after surgery. Additionally, a significant improvement in functioning (Oswestry score) was registered. Both clinical parameters - as far as they could be checked - showed a steady degree of improvement over a period of at least 3 years. This comparative analysis led to the conclusion that balloon kyphoplasty can be successfully applied indiscriminately in patients with vertebral fractures as a result of osteoporosis and also to fractures associated with bone metastases or with myeloma.",ger,0.0

The radiofrequency kyphoplasty is an innovative procedure available since 2009, for which an ultra-high viscosity cement is used. For the statistical comparison of the two methods of augmentation, the clinical and radiological data of 2 larger patient groups were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of the surgical treatment of patients with conservative therapy-resistant osteoporotic vertebral fractures, a prospective study of radiofrequency kyphoplasty (RFK) was performed between 2009 and September 2010. The treatment was minimally invasive using the StabiliT(R) Vertebral Augmentation System by DFine for which the StabiliT(R) multiplex controller, the articulating VertecoR(R) Midline Osteotome, and the radiofrequency-sensitive StabiliT(R) ER2 bone cement were applied. From the clinical aspect, measurement parameters for efficacy and safety were the course of pain intensity using a visual analogue scale (VAS: 0 to 100 mm) and the Oswestry disability score (0-100%). For the radiological outcome the increase in the middle and anterior parts of the treated vertebra and also the reduction of kyphosis after surgery and after 6 months were evaluated. Furthermore, the extent of cement extrusion and the duration of operation time were compared. There were 2 groups of patients chosen with the same indication, and with the same average VAS prior to treatment. For the balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) the Kyphon(R) technology was used. For the BKP group the same parameters as in the first group were evaluated (matched pairs). To compare the data statistically, parametric and non-parametric tests were applied. RESULTS: For the radiofrequency kyphoplasty group (RFK) 114 patients were recruited, and for the balloon kyphoplasty group (BKP) 114 appropriate patients were selected. In 48% of the RFK patients and in 44% of the BKP patients more than one vertebral body were treated (thoracic or lumbar). Prior to treatment 84 mm on the VAS were calculated in both groups. The decrease in VAS values (RFK vs. BKP) immediately after surgery was 58.8 vs. 54.7 mm (p = 0.02), and 73.0 vs. 58.9 mm after 6 months (p < 0.001). In both groups improvements in the Oswestry scores were registered after 6 months without a statistically significant difference. In both groups, the middle part of the vertebral bodies was increased by an average of 3.1 mm. RFK yielded a decrease in the average kyphosis angle of 4.4, the BKP resulted in about 3.8 degrees. Concerning cement leakage a key difference in favor of the radio frequency kyphoplasty was detected (6.1 % vs. 27.8%; p < 0.0001). For RFK a significant shorter duration of operation time was calculated (28.2 vs. 49.6 min; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The RFK has proven to be a clinically very effective procedure that does somewhat better than BKP in long-lasting pain relief. No differences could be detected regarding improvement of functioning and the mean restoration of mid- and anterior vertebral height. As far as the safety aspect is concerned the RFK offers the advantage of a statistically significant lower proportion of cement extrusion.",ger,0.0

The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate whether both procedures are able to reduce pain and to preserve postoperative vertebral height during a 1-year follow up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Osteoporotic vertebral fractures were treated in 42 cases, 20 patients (15 female, 5 male) underwent vertebroplasty, 22 patients (14 female, 8 male) underwent kyphoplasty. 32 vertebral fractures were treated with vertebroplasty and 35 vertebral fractures were treated with kyphoplasty. Symptomatic levels were identified by correlating the clinical presentation with conventional radiographs, CT or/and MRI. During the follow up reduction of pain was determined. Radiographic scans were performed pre- and postoperatively and after 3, 6 and 12 months. The vertebral height and endplate angles were measured to assess the restoration of the sagittal alignment. The effects on pain symptoms were measured on a self-reported Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Oswestry score was documented. RESULTS: The median pain scores (VAS) decreased significantly for kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty from pre- to post-treatment, as did the Oswestry score (p < 0.05). No significant differences could be found between both groups for the median pain score (VAS) and the Oswestry score. Kyphoplsty led to a significant restoration of the vertebral height and reduction of kyphosis (p < 0.05). During the 1-year follow up both operation techniques were able to stabilize the height of the vertebral body. CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are effective minimally invasive procedures for the stabilization of osteoporotic vertebral fractures leading to a statistically significant reduction in pain.

Sixty-five patients (37 men, mean age: 66 years) underwent 99 BKP procedures. Patient-related outcomes of pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index were assessed pre- and post-operatively and after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Correction of vertebral height and kyphotic deformity were assessed by radiographic measurements. Mean pain VAS and Oswestry Disability Index significantly improved from pre- to post-treatment (P < 0.0001), this improvement being sustained up to 24-month follow up. A gain in height restoration and a reduction of the post-operative kyphotic angle were seen post-operatively and at 3 months although these radiographic outcomes returned to pre-operative levels at 12 months. BKP was associated with a rate of cement leakage and incidence vertebral fracture of 12 and 8%, respectively.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to compare outcomes of percutaneous versus open pedicle screw fixation for thoracolumbar fractures. METHODS: Relevant articles were identified from six electronic databases from their inception to December 2014. RESULTS: From 12 relevant studies identified, 279 patients undergoing percutaneous fixation were compared with 340 open fixation procedures. Operative duration was significantly shorter in the percutaneous group by 19 min (P = 0.0002). The percutaneous approach was also associated with shorter hospital stay by 5.7 days (P = 0.0007). Whilst there was no difference in screw malpositioning (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33, 1.83; P = 0.56), the percutaneous approach had lower rates of infections (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13, 1.00; P = 0.05), and superior visual analogue scale clinical outcomes (P = 0.001). No difference was found between the groups in terms of postoperative Cobb angle (P = 0.22), postoperative body angle (P = 0.66), and postoperative anterior body height (P = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: The percutaneous approach was associated with shorter operative duration and hospital stay, reduced intraoperative blood loss and reduced infection rates. Given the lack of robust clinical evidence, these findings warrant verification in large prospective registries and randomized trials.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,F. M. Phillips,2003.0,Minimally invasive treatments of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures,10.1097/01.brs.0000076898.37566.32,"STUDY DESIGN: A literature review of experiences with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for treating symptomatic, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). OBJECTIVES: To summarize the advantages and disadvantages of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporotic VCFs are a leading cause of disability and morbidity in the elderly. The consequences of osteoporotic VCFs (pain and often progressive vertebral collapse with resultant spinal kyphosis) adversely affect quality of life, physical function, mental health, and survival. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive procedures for treating painful fractures. Vertebroplasty entails the percutaneous injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebra in attempts to stabilize the fracture and reduce pain. Kyphoplasty addresses pain and kyphotic deformity by the percutaneous expansion of an inflatable bone tamp to effect fracture reduction before cement deposition in a fractured vertebra. METHODS: A literature review of surgical techniques, indications, clinical results, and complications for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. RESULTS: Studies of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have reported excellent pain relief and improved function in most patients with osteoporotic VCFs. Vertebroplasty has the advantage of being relatively quick and inexpensive. Kyphoplasty, while associated with increased cost and surgical time, offers the potential to improve spinal alignment. In addition, by creating an intravertebral cavity, kyphoplasty reduces the risk of extravertebral bone filler extravasation. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are currently used to treat osteoporotic VCFs with successful short-term results. Prospective, randomized studies comparing these procedures to one another and comparing their long-term outcomes to conventional medical management are required to define precise roles of these exciting treatments in the spine physician's armamentarium.",eng,0.0

Pazianos",2003.0,Minimally invasive treatments of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty,", ","Although nonsurgical treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, including medication, exercise, bracing, and bed rest, have been reasonably effective, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have evolved as valuable adjunctive treatment options. Over the past decade, vertebroplasty, which involves the percutaneous injection of bone cement directly into the fractured vertebral body, has been used as a treatment for painful osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures, a leading cause of morbidity in the elderly. Kyphoplasty, another minimally invasive procedure that allows for correction of spinal deformity and for controlled cement filling of the fractured vertebral body, involves the percutaneous cannulation of the vertebral body followed by the placement of an inflatable bone tamp. Reported results for both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty suggest rapid improvement in pain and physical functioning in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Kyphoplasty allows for low-pressure cement injection and affords the opportunity to correct spinal deformity. Further study is required to define the precise indications, timing, and relative merits of these techniques.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and pattern of extravertebral contrast extravasation after intravertebral injection during kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, which have implications for cement leakage during these procedures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty involves the injection of cement directly into the cancellous bone of a fractured vertebral body in an attempt to stabilize the fracture. High rates of extravertebral cement leakage have been noted. Injection of contrast into the vertebral body under fluoroscopy has been recommended in an attempt to predict and minimize cement leakage. An alternative procedure, balloon kyphoplasty, involves the percutaneous placement of an inflatable bone tamp into the fractured vertebral body. As the tamp is inflated, vertebral body height is restored and a cavity is created within the vertebral body, allowing for low-pressure cement filling of the cavity. METHODS: During 20 kyphoplasty surgeries for vertebral compression fractures, contrast studies were performed. Immediately after positioning of an 11-gauge biopsy needle within the midvertebral body, 5 mL of Omnipaque was injected, mimicking vertebroplasty injection. Cinefluoroscopic images were obtained during injection. After bilateral fracture reduction and intravertebral cavity creation using inflatable bone tamps (kyphoplasty), contrast was injected again, mimicking cement injection during kyphoplasty. Scoring of the extravertebral contrast leakage was based on filling of the inferior vena cava and epidural vessels, as well as direct contrast extension through the vertebral cortex. RESULTS: The mean contrast leak scores for vertebroplasty- and kyphoplasty-stage injections were, respectively, 4.3 and 0.8 of 6 (P = 0.0001). The scores for epidural vessel and inferior vena cava filling and transcortical contrast leak each was significantly lower for kyphoplasty- than for vertebroplasty-stage injections (P = 0.0001 each). CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed less vascular and transcortical extravasation of injected contrast with kyphoplasty than with vertebroplasty. Although leakage of contrast may not correlate precisely with polymethylmethacrylate leakage, the authors believe this study highlights the relative safety of these procedures.",eng,0.0

The pain did not improve after the kyphoplasty procedure, and the patient developed a posterior cleft in the fusion mass postoperatively. The patient, a 46-year-old woman, had undergone a T4-L4 instrumented fusion with placement of a Harrington rod when she was 12 years old. Adjacent-segment breakdown developed, and her fusion was extended to the pelvis, with pedicle screws placed up to L-3 to capture the existing fusion mass. Almost 2 years after fusion extension, she fell down the stairs and suffered an L-2 compression fracture, which is when kyphoplasty was performed without pain relief, and she then developed a cleft in the posterior fusion mass that was previously intact. She refused further surgical options.

Thelen,2004.0,[Evaluation of percutaneous vertebroplasty in osteoporotic vertebral fractures using a combination of CT fluoroscopy and conventional lateral fluoroscopy],10.1055/s-2004-813191,"PURPOSE: Evaluation of vertebroplasty using a combination of CT-fluoroscopy and conventional lateral fluoroscopy in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients (23male, 35 women, age 69.7 +/- 10.2 years) with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures were treated with vertebroplasty in conscious sedation and local anesthesia. Spiral-CT with sagittal reconstructions of the respective vertebral bodies was used for classification of the fracture. The cannula was placed under CT-guidance in the ventral third of the respective vertebral bodies and cement instilled under CT fluoroscopy and lateral fluoroscopy. When cement migrated towards the vertebral canal, the injection was immediately stopped for 30 - 60 seconds. After polymerization in this location, the injection was continued until sufficient filling of the vertebra. Results were documented by spiral CT with sagittal reconstructions. RESULTS: A total of 123 vertebral bodies were treated, comprising 39 thoracic and 84 lumbar vertebral bodies, with a mean of 2.1 +/- 1.3 (range 1 to 6) vertebral bodies in each patient and a maximum of 3 vertebral bodies per session. All interventions were successfully completed in conscious sedation and local anesthesia. A mean volume of 5.9 +/- 0.6 ml (range 2 to 14 ml) cement was applied for each vertebra, with 79.7 % of procedures performed using a unilateral access. To achieve a sufficient cement deposit, a bilateral access was used in 20.3 %. The dorsal wall of the vertebra was included in 23.6 % of the fractures. In one case, cement migration into the spinal canal was detected, reducing the diameter of the canal by 30 %. In two other cases, cement leakage was seen at the puncture site of the vertebra (one intercostotransversally in the 10 (th) thoracic vertebra and one dorsolaterally in the 1 (st) lumbar vertebra) with retrograde cement migration through the neuroforamen into the epidural space. In one of these cases, the cannulation of the vertebra had been changed before cement application resulting in a hole in the dorsolateral vertebral wall. However, all patients were discharged without evidence of neurologic complications. Multiplanar reconstructions of CT scans were used for the detection of extraosseous cement leaks: The incidence of extraosseous cement leaks was 4.1 % in epidural veins, 6.5 % in paravertebral vessels (6 veins, 2 arteries), and 17.9 and 11.4 %, respectively, for upper or lower end plates. At discharge, 25 patients (43.1 %) were free of pain and 28 (48.3 %) significantly improved with a considerable reduction of analgetic drugs. Significant complaints persisted in 5 patients (8.6 %) with concomitant degenerative disease in four and vasculitis in one case. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is effective for stabilization and pain management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The procedure can be safely performed in conscious sedation and local anesthesia. Compared to conventional fluoroscopy alone, CT fluoroscopy provides an excellent additional monitoring of the procedure and probably contributes to the safety of the procedure.",ger,0.0

Patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures were treated with vertebroplasty. Results were documented and prospectively followed by means of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. The frequency and the types of cement leakages were analysed from multiplanar CT images and secondary fractures were characterised as follows: (1) adjacent fracture in the immediate vicinity of an augmented vertebra; (2) sandwich fracture, fracture of an untreated vertebra between two vertebrae that had been previously augmented, and (3) distant fractures not in the vicinity of augmented vertebrae. A total of 385 osteoporotic vertebral fractures were treated in 191 patients (61 men, 130 women, age 70.7 +/- 9.7 years). The overall rate of cement leaks was 55.6%, including all leaks detectable by CT. Intradiscal leaks through the upper, the lower, and both endplates occurred in 18.2%, 6.8%, and 2.6%, respectively. In 39 patients (20.4%), a total of 72 secondary fractures occurred: 30 adjacent fractures in 23 patients (12.0%) with a time to fracture of 2 months [median; 1.0/4.0 months, first/third quartile (Q1/Q3)]; 11 secondary sandwich fractures in 11 patients (5.8%) after 1.5 months (median; 0.25/7.5 months, Q1/Q3); and 31 distant fractures in 20 patients (10.5%) after 5 months (median; 2.0/8.0 months, Q1/Q3). Ten of 30 adjacent fractures occurred in the presence of pre-existing intradiscal cement leaks and 20 where there was no leakage. Six of 11 sandwich fractures occurred in the presence of intradiscal leaks (five leaks in both adjacent disc spaces, one leak in the lower disc space) and five where there was no leakage. The rate of secondary adjacent and non-adjacent fractures is quite similar and there is no specific impact of intradiscal leakages on the occurrence of adjacent secondary fractures. Adjacent fractures occur sooner than distant secondary fractures. Sandwich fractures are associated with specific biomechanical conditions, with a 37.9% fracture rate in sandwich constellations.",eng,1.0

Patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures or osteolytic lesions caused by malignant tumors were treated with CT-guided vertebroplasty. The technical results were documented with CT, and the extraosseous cement leakages and periinterventional clinical complications were analyzed as well as secondary fractures during follow-up. Since 2002, 500 vertebroplasty procedures have been performed on 251 patients (82 male, 169 female, age 71.5 +/- 9.8 years) suffering from osteoporotic compression fractures (n = 217) and/or malignant tumour infiltration (n = 34). The number of vertebrae treated per patient was 1.96 +/- 1.29 (range 1-10); the numbers of interventions per patient and interventions per vertebra were 1.33 +/- 0.75 (range 1-6) and 1.01 +/- 0.10, respectively. The amount of PMMA cement was 4.5 +/- 1.9 ml and decreased during the 5-year period of investigation. The procedure-related 30-day mortality was 0.4% (1 of 251 patients) due to pulmonary embolism in this case. The procedure-related morbidity was 2.8% (7/251), including one acute coronary syndrome beginning 12 h after the procedure and one missing patellar reflex in a patients with a cement leak near the neuroformen because of osteolytic destruction of the respective pedicle. Additionally, one patient developed a medullary conus syndrome after a fall during the night after vertebroplasty, two patients reached an inadequate depth of conscious sedation, and two cases had additional fractures (one pedicle fracture, one rib fracture). The overall CT-based cement leak rate was 55.4% and included leakages predominantly into intervertebral disc spaces (25.2%), epidural vein plexus (16.0%), through the posterior wall (2.6%), into the neuroforamen (1.6%), into paravertebral vessels (7.2%), and combinations of these and others. During follow-up (15.2 +/- 13.4 months) the secondary fracture rate was 17.1%, including comparable numbers for vertebrae at adjacent and distant levels. The presence of intradiscal cement leaks was not associated with increased adjacent fracture rates. CT-guided vertebroplasty is safe and effective for treatment of vertebral compression fractures. CT-fluoroscopy provides an excellent control of the posterior vertebral wall. The number of cement leakages alone is not directly associated with clinical complications. However, even small volumes of pulmonary PMMA embolism might be responsible for the fatal outcome in cases with underlying cardiopulmonary insufficiency.",English,1.0

Patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with pain resistant to analgetic drugs were treated with polymethylmethacrylate vertebroplasty. Mean +/- standard error cement volume was 5.1 +/- 2.0 ml. Vertebral geometry was documented by sagittal and coronal reformations from multidetector computed tomography data sets: anterior, posterior, and lateral vertebral heights, end plate angles, and compression index (CI = anterior/posterior height). Additionally, the VDU (vertebral bodies plus both adjacent disk spaces) was calculated from the multidetector computed tomography data sets: anterior, posterior, and both lateral aspects. Patients were assigned to two groups: moderate compression with CI of >0.75 (group 1) and severe compression with CI of <0.75 (group 2). A total of 83 vertebral bodies of 30 patients (7 men, 23 women, age 70.7 +/- 9.7 years, range 40-82 years) were treated with vertebroplasty and prospectively followed for 24 months. In the moderate compression group (group 1), the vertebral heights were stabilized over time at the preinterventional levels. Compared with group 1, group 2 showed a greater anterior height gain (+2.8 +/- 2.2 mm vs. +0.8 +/- 2.0 mm, P < 0.001), better reduction of end plate angle (-4.9 +/- 4.8 degrees vs. -1.0 +/- 2.7 degrees , P < 0.01), and improved CI (+0.12 +/- 0.13 vs. +0.02 +/- 0.07, P < 0.01) and demonstrated preserved anterior height gain at 2 years (+1.2 +/- 3.2 mm, P < 0.01) as well as improved end plate angles (-5.2 +/- 5.0 degrees , P < 0.01) and compression indices (+0.11 +/- 0.15, P < 0.01). Thus, posterior height loss of vertebrae and adjacent intervertebral disk spaces contributed to a remodeling of the VDU, resulting in some compensation of the kyphotic malposition of the affected vertebral segment. Vertebroplasty improved vertebral geometry during midterm follow-up. In severe vertebral compression, significant height gain and improvement of end plate angles were achieved.

Osteoporotic fractures were treated with vertebroplasty. The vertebral geometry and disc spaces were analysed using reformatted computed tomography (CT) images: heights of the anterior, posterior, and lateral vertebral walls, disc spaces, endplate angles, and minimal endplate distances. Vertebrae were assigned to group I [severe compression (anterior height/posterior height) <0.75] and group II (moderate compression index >0.75). A total of 102 vertebral bodies in 40 patients (12 men, 28 women, age 70.3 +/- 9.5) were treated with vertebroplasty and prospectively followed for 12 months. Group I showed a greater benefit compared with group II with respect to anterior height gain (+2.1 +/- 1.9 vs +0.7 +/- 1.6 mm, P < 0.001), reduction of endplate angle (-3.6 +/- 4.2 vs -0.8 +/- 2.3 degrees , P < 0.001), and compression index (+0.09 +/- 0.11 vs +0.01 +/- 0.06, P < 0.001). At one-year follow-up, group I demonstrated preserved anterior height gain (+1.5 +/- 2.8 mm, P < 0.015) and improved endplate angle (-3.4 +/- 4.9 degrees , P < 0.001). In group II, the vertebral heights returned to and were fixed at the pre-interventional levels. Vertebroplasty provided vertebral height gain over one year, particularly in cases with severe compression. Vertebrae with moderate compression were fixed and stabilized at the pre-treatment level over one year.",eng,1.0

We therefore performed a systematic review to assess the efficacy and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. A search was conducted using Medline, Embase and The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The search yielded fifteen studies, eleven prospective, three retrospective and one controlled trial. Totally 1,136 interventions were performed on 793 patients. Mean pain scores, measured using a 0 to 10 VAS score, improved significantly from 7.8 to 3.1 (-60.3%) immediately after percutaneous vertebroplasty. The short-term complication rate varied between 0.4 and 75.6%. Leakage of cement outside the vertebral body was markedly common, ranging from 3.3 to 75.6%. Although the majority was asymptomatic, a few devastating clinical adverse effects were reported (mean 2.4%). Although percutaneous vertebroplasty is a widely accepted treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fractures, we revealed only a single controlled trial. We conclude that there are insufficient data available to reliably assess efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty.

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of underlying previously unrecognized etiology in a consecutive series of patients undergoing kyphoplasty to treat vertebral compression fractures. A prospective histological evaluation of vertebral body biopsy specimens from presumed osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were performed in order to identify aforementioned causes. Over a 2-year period, vertebral body biopsies from 154 vertebral levels were performed in 75 patients undergoing kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fractures. All patients received a preoperative workup that included plain radiographs, MRI, whole body bone scan, and laboratory examinations. Bone specimens were obtained from affected vertebral bodies and submitted for histologic evaluation to identify the prevalence of an underlying cause. All specimens demonstrated fragmented bone with variable amounts of unmineralised bone, signs of bone-remodeling and/or fracture-healing. In 11 patients underlying pathology other than osteoporosis was identified (prostate cancer, 1; pancreatic cancer, 1; colon cancer, 1; breast cancer, 2; multiple myeloma, 3; leukemia, 1; and lung cancer, 2). In all but one patient the results of the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis suspected from the preoperative workup. For the last patient, namely the one with pancreatic cancer, the workup did not identify the origin of the primary tumor, although the patient was considered to have a compression fracture secondary to metastatic disease of unknown origin, the vertebral biopsy suggested the presence of adenocarcinoma which eventually was proven to be pancreatic cancer. In augmentation procedures for vertebral compression fractures, bone biopsy should be reserved for the patients where the preoperative evaluation raises the suspicion of a non-osteoporotic etiology.",eng,0.0

PURPOSE: To compare the effect of vertebroplasty on the compressive strength of unfractured vertebral bodies. STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical study on cadaveric thoracic vertebrae. METHODS: Forty vertebral bodies from four cadaveric thoracic spines were used for this experiment. Before testing, each thoracic spine was submitted to bone density testing and radiographic evaluation to rule out any obvious fractures. Under image intensification, 6 mL of a mixture of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) with barium (8 g of barium/40 g of PMMA) was injected into every other vertebral body of each spine specimen. After vertebroplasty, all soft tissues were dissected from the spine, and the vertebral bodies were separated and potted for mechanical testing. Testing to failure was performed using a combination of axial compression and anterior flexion moments. Two pneumatic cylinders applied anterior and posterior loads at a distance ratio of 4:3 relative to the anterior vertebral body wall, whereas two additional cylinders applied lateral loads, each at a constant rate of 200 N/s. RESULTS: The average failure loads for nonvertebroplasty specimens was 6724.02 +/- 3291.70 N, whereas the specimens injected with PMMA failed at an average compressive force of 5770.50 +/- 2133.72 N. No statistically significant difference in failure loads could be detected between intact specimens and those that had undergone vertebroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Under these specific loading conditions, no significant increase in compressive strength of the vertebral bodies could be documented. This suggests that some caution should be applied to the concept of prophylactic"" vertebroplasty in patients at risk for fracture.""",eng,1.0

METHODS: A 15-year-old boy needed a surgical Th8 posttraumatic vertebral body (VB) compressive fracture reduction due to insufficient conservative treatment and consistent severe clinical symptoms. After 6 months of external Jevett long-roll brace stabilization, progressive sagittal balance disturbance of thoracic kyphosis was measured and persistent clinical symptoms were observed. It was decided to present a surgical technique method allowing to attempt to reduce VB fracture, rebalance the vertebral column (VC) without any motion limitation, and decrease clinical symptoms. The procedure was performed percutaneously from extrapedicular approach with intravertebral implant (Spine Jack(R)-Vexim) and cement (Interface(R)-Vexim) under fluoroscopic imaging (Ziehm 8000(R)). RESULTS: The whole procedure was uneventful. Now, the child is free from clinical symptoms and the partial reduction of VB fracture was achieved. The patient has been followed for 3 months. In the control CT scans, the VB fracture reduction is stable and no progression of thoracic kyphosis angle is observed. Furthermore since the surgical procedure, the patient is clinical symptom free. CONCLUSION: The extrapedicular percutaneus technique of VB fracture reduction with intravertebral fixation allowed to partially reduce the VB compressive fracture, rebalance the VC without any motion limitation, avoid external long-roll brace, and eliminate clinical symptoms. The procedure is minimally invasive, fast, and clinically effective. However, the technique should be restricted only to carefully selected clinical cases.",eng,0.0

It results in significant mortality and morbidity. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a procedure that injects percutaneously bone cement into a collapsed vertebra. OBJECTIVE: To determine the results of PVP in pain reduction from osteoporosis VCF and its complications. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Thirty-five patients (34 women, 1 man, 48-98 years) with persistent back pain due to VCF underwent 66 percutaneous injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) into the vertebrae (27 thoracic levels, 39 lumbar levels) under fluoroscopic guidance between December 2003 and July 2005. Severity of back pain was assessed by using visual analog scale (VAS) before and after the operation. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (91%) reported significant pain relief the mean VAS of 35 patients, before PVP and after an 8-week period, post-operatively, were 6.9 +/-1.8 and 2.0+/-1.8 (p = 0.001).

Such patients are more prone to develop painful and debilitating spinal deformities but are difficult to treat. Currently, no definitive treatment algorithm has been established. PURPOSE: To review the failure modes of instrumentation and novel surgical treatments of spinal deformities in patients with osteoporosis with the goal of improving surgical care. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Review article. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed for articles regarding instrumentation failure modes and surgical treatments of spinal deformities in patients with osteoporosis and summarized current treatment options. RESULTS: The surgical treatment options are severely limited because of the tendency for instrument failure secondary to pullout and subsidence, leading to revision procedures; multiple levels and multiple fixation points are recommended to minimize the risk. The literature supports the use of vertebroplasty in conjunction with pedicle screw-based instrumentation for treating more severe spinal deformities. Other techniques and modifications with evidence of reduced failure risk are bicortical screws, hydroxyapatite coatings, double screws, and expandable screws. Anterior approaches may provide another avenue of treatment, but only a few studies have been conducted on these implants in patients with osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal deformities in patients with osteoporosis are difficult to treat because of their debilitating and progressive nature. Novel surgical approaches and instruments have been designed to decrease construct failures in this patient population by reducing implant pullout, subsidence, and incidence of revision surgery. The success of these techniques depends on integrating biomaterial, biologic, and biomechanical aspects with clinical considerations. Synthesizing this myriad of aspects will lead to improved treatment options for patients with osteoporosis who are suffering from spinal deformities.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 85 vertebroplasties were performed in 51 consecutive patients (31 women, 20 men; mean age, 71.9 y; range, 48-92 y) in 51 sessions. The needle was inserted with guidance from intermittent single-shot CT scans, and intermittent CT fluoroscopy was used during cement injection only. To reduce the risk of extravertebral or extraosseous leakage, several procedures (cement injection stopping/slowing, needle position changes) were employed. The chest and treated bone were scanned immediately after vertebroplasty. These CT images included the entire thorax as well as the treated vertebrae. RESULTS: No cement emboli were observed on CT after vertebroplasty. After 85 vertebroplasty procedures, 44 extravertebral leaks were detected. Epidural leaks were observed on CT in six treated vertebrae (7%), in 12 cases in the anterior external venous plexus (14.1%), in five in the azygos vein (5.8%), in 19 in the disc space (22%), and in two in the foraminal space (2.3%). On a per-patient basis, the odds of leaks increased with the number of vertebroplasties (P = .05) and the volume of cement used (P = .0412). There was also a higher probability of leak (P < .05) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (67.9%; 95% confidence interval, 47.7%-84.1%) than osteolytic spinal metastases (34.8%; 16.4%-57.3%).

In this investigation, validated outcome tools were utilized to document the impact of vertebroplasty on pain and function. METHODS: Fifty patients were recruited at a tertiary university hospital. Patients had been treated for intractable pain due to osteoporotic compression fracture(s) for at least four weeks. The vertebroplasty procedures were performed by a radiologist. The subjects were followed prospectively for one year and received conservative treatment in conjunction with the vertebroplasty. Validated outcome tools, including a visual analog scale, the Oswestry scale, and the Roland-Morris functional activity questionnaire, were used to evaluate changes in pain and functional capabilities. RESULTS: Fifty patients, thirty-one women and nineteen men (mean age, 68.6 years), were followed prospectively for one year. One hundred and three fractures (fifty-nine thoracic and forty-four lumbar) were treated. The visual analog scale showed the greatest improvement between the baseline score (mean, 7.76) and the score at one month (mean, 2.9), and the score remained improved at one year (mean, 2.9).

Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a newer technique in which a medical grade cement is injected though a needle into a painful fractured vertebral body. This stabilizes the fracture, allowing most patients to discontinue or significantly decrease analgesics and resume normal activity. The impact of this procedure on the morbidity and expense associated with symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in the United States may be significant. Patients who are unresponsive to conservative therapy of bed rest, analgesics, and back bracing should be considered for vertebroplasty. This procedure is contraindicated in patients with active infection, untreated coagulopathy, and certain types of fracture morphology. Because many patients have multiple chronic fractures, there should be a strong correlation between the physical examination signs, symptoms, and cross-sectional imaging findings. The success rate for this procedure in treating osteoporotic fractures is 73 to 90 percent. Vertebroplasty can effectively treat aggressive hemangiomas of the vertebral body and may be palliative in patients with malignant pathologic fractures.

These fractures can be most sensitively detected with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Similar to balloon kyphoplasty, sacroplasty provides fixation of these fractures with cement. OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to investigate whether pain is reduced using this method and whether computed tomography (CT)-guided cement application results in less cement extravasation and fewer complications than C-arm controlled application. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter study, 46 patients (41 female, 5 male) with an average age of 75 years were treated by sacroplasty. The procedure was performed with CT-guidance for 25 patients and with C-arm control for 21 patients. Pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale. Patients were followed up for 6 months. RESULTS: The average operation time was 35 min and postinterventional hospital stay averaged 4 days. In the CT group pain decreased from an average score of 8.8 +/- 0.7 preoperatively to 2.6 +/- 0.6 postoperatively (p < 0.001) and in the C-arm group pain decreased from 8.2 +/-1.0 to 2.2+/- 1.4 (p < 0.001). There were no cases of cement extravasation in the CT group (0 out of 25 = 0 %) and 8 asymptomatic cases in the C-arm group (8 out of 21 = 38 %). In addition, there were two injuries to the superior gluteal artery with hematoma in the area of puncture, one requiring operative treatment. There were two mortalities in the CT group from lung disease and stroke during the study but this was unrelated to the operation.

Its effectiveness has been substantiated in multiple clinical studies. Not only is prompt pain reduction achieved, but according to a new, large, long-term study, long-term survival is also increased. PATIENTS: Balloon kyphoplasty was performed for 1069 patients between 01.01.2008 and 31.12.2013. In all cases, pain was rated more than 6/10 points, and a recent fracture was evident on cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRT STIR T2) performed to supplement spine X-rays. Average patient age was 77 +/- 5.2 years. 73 % of patients were female. Treated fracture levels ranged from T 3 to L 5. METHODS: A single level was treated in 627 cases, two levels were treated simultaneously in 246 cases, three levels in 73 cases, and four levels in 29 cases.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review and report details regarding the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of coblation and cementoplasty for treating painful advanced vertebral body metastatic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with painful metastatic vertebral body fractures with a posterior cortical defect and/or epidural tumor extension underwent percutaneous coblation and cementoplasty. Each patient's medical record was reviewed for technical success, imaging outcome, complications, and palliative effect. RESULTS: Of the 15 cases, 14 were completed successfully. Postprocedure imaging studies demonstrated adequate cement deposition within the targeted vertebral body without cement extravasation or fracture progression during the 1-3 months follow-up period. Pain relief was achieved in all patients, and no neurological damage was reported (mean follow-up, 141.1 +/- 132.5 days). CONCLUSION: Percutaneous image-guided coblation-mediated cavity creation prior to vertebroplasty allows for safe, efficacious cement deposition in patients with metastatic foci.

Ten days before, she had undergone a vertebroplasty with injection of cement into lumbar vertebra 3 because of an osteoporotic fracture. This treatment did not result in a reduction of the lower back pain, which was the main reason for the procedure. However, the patient claimed to have increasing pain radiating to her left leg. Furthermore, she suffered from numbness of her left leg. Clinical examination showed a lack of power in this leg according to hip flexion with a degree of 3/5. X-ray examinations showed paravertebral cement particles and led to the suspicion that the paravertebral cement had caused nerve root compression. MRI and CT myelography showed that the cement had drained into the intraspinal, extradural venous plexus (Batson's plexus). The plexus was filled out with cement between L2 and L5 on both sides. There was nearly no cement in the fractured vertebra L3, but cement had also run onto the paravertebral veins up to the vena cava, which was also involved. The cemented veins had led to a stenosis of the neuroforamina L2 and L3 on the left side. The result was compression of left L3 nerve root. After consulting with our vascular surgeons, we decided on a non-operative treatment. We prescribed a lumbar brace as external stabilisation and as an antithrombotic treatment we gave the patient weight adapted low molecular weight heparin.",ger,0.0

METHODS: 182 patients with painful vertebral compression fractures were treated. A total of 97 patients were enrolled in this prospective study. 97 patients with a mean age of 65.3 years were classified into control group and surgical treatment group of non-random. 35 patients were in control group and 62 patients who were performed percutaneous vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty in treatment group. X-ray and Magnetic resonance imaging were done at the first and final visit. The grade of disc degeneration above the fractured vertebral was confirmed by evaluation of bony oedema in the fat suppressed sequences and T2-weighted image of magnetic resonance imaging. The height of degenerative disc was measured on X-ray film. RESULTS: All patients were followed up two years after the first visit and the follow-up rate was 90.7% (88/97). The incidence of degeneration of adjacent disc above the fractured vertebral was 29.0% (9/31) in control group and 52.6% (30/57) in treatment group.

OBJECTIVES: To illustrate the relevance of vertebral wedge-shaped changes in X-ray imaging at supine and standing positions in patients with percutaneous kyphoplasty as well as the postoperative effect. SETTING: All patient data were collected from a hospital in China. METHODS: Between June 2006 and May 2010, 77 surgical patients (9 men and 68 women) with wedge-shaped compression fractures were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into group A (DeltaWR>/=2.5%) and group B (DeltaWR<2.5%) according to the dynamic changes in the percentage of vertebral body wedge-shaped variable ratio (WR) at supine and standing positions. The intensity of back pain in different positions pre- and postoperatively was evaluated with a visual analog pain scale (VAS). RESULTS: The WRs in both standing and supine positions were significantly reduced by kyphoplasty in both groups A and B. In agreement with the improvement in WRs, the VAS was significantly decreased in three positions for patients in group A and in turning over and standing position for patients in group B.

Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of kyphoplasty in the treatment of MVCF without epidural involvement. We performed a retrospective review of clinical outcome data for 48 patients with multiple spinal metastases treated with kyphoplasty. Outcome data (vertebral body height variation, degree of kyphosis, visual analog scale score for pain, Oswestry Disability Index score, the Short Form-36 [SF-36] questionnaire score for function) were collected preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment.

METHODS: From January 2011 to January 2013, the clinical data of 180 patients with primary OVCFs treated by PVP were retrospectively analyzed. There were 75 males and 105 females, aged from 68 to 95 years old with an average of (79.50 +/- 5.45) years. The involved vertebrae were identified according to the clinical symptoms and imaging data. PVP were performed in 362 vertebrae and the patients were followed up with an average of 12 months. Subsequent vertebral fractures were found through the pain's reappearance and MRI or bone scan. The patients were divided into secondary fracture group and no-secondary fracture group according to the subsequent fractures or no. Secondary fracture group was divided into two groups according to gender, and the patients with secondary fracture were also categorized into the original surgical vertebral fractures, adjacent vertebral fracture and remote vertebral fractures. The age, gender, the cement volume, the cement leakage, secondary fracture site, the incidence and type of secondary fracture were observed and compared among different groups. RESULTS: Among the 362 vertebrae of PVP, there were 109 vertebrae in male and 253 vertebrae in female. And 27 vertebrae (10 in male and 17 in female) of 22 cases (9 males and 13 females) occurred secondary fracture. The second PVP were performed in 13 cases (16 vertebrae) and the third PVP in 2 cases (4 vertebrae); 7 cases (7 vertebrae) were treated with conservative therapy. There was no statistically significant difference on age, gender, cement volume and leakage between secondary fracture group and no-secondary fracture group (P > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference on the incidence and type of secondary fracture between male and female (P > 0.05). No significant difference was found on the adjacent and remote vertebral fractures (P > 0.05).

CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the subsequent fracture after PVP for the OVCFs different gender and fractured site, and also no significant difference in the adjacent and remote vertebral fractures. The report didn't support the biomechanical viewpoint that vertebral body stiffness increasing after PVP would lead to adjacent vertebral stress increasing and result easily in adjacent vertebral fracture.

However, several questions of interest remain to be clarified, including how does PMMA affect the cement-bone interface area and surrounding bone tissue, can damaged bone tissues be repaired, how will PMMA change the bone interface over the long-term, and what happens to PMMA itself? The purpose of this study is to investigate these concerns and provide a basis for clinical evaluation. We made bone defects in the lumbar vertebrae of New Zealand rabbits as a model of osteoporosis and injected them with bone cement. A mechanical testing machine was used to perform axial compression, three-point bending, and twisting resistance tests to observe and investigate the short- and long-term biomechanical properties of PMMA after implantation. Optical, fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, and nanoindentation were used to observe the changes in the interface microstructure. PMMA can rapidly establish the strong support with stable function in the near future. Biomechanical experiments showed that biomechanical property of bone cement group was significantly higher than those in the other two groups (P<0.05) biomechanical property of bone cement group may decline with the time, but it's still better than that of OP in the control group (P<0.05). Histomorphological observation result shows that under osteoporosis state the bone grows slower, also bone's rebuilding time extended. And in the later period, main bone's continuous osteoporosis has some impact on the interface. Nano-indentation testing shows that the young modulus and stiffness of the interface among bone, material and interface were significantly differences (P<0.05). Bone cement had gave the best nano indentation hardness, then was interface and bone tissue. PMMA bone cement was able to quickly support and stabilize the defect in the short term, and bone growth restarted at the bone interface and was tightly integrated. However, over the long-term, fluorescent signal was weakened, osteoclasts appeared, the mechanical indicators for both the interface and the whole vertebra decreased, and bone resorption was eventually greater than bone formation, resulting in bone loss. Therefore, vertebroplasty is not the end of treatment, and we need to further study ways to improve the bone cement material, which is crucial for long-term vertebroplasty efficacy, to better treat osteoporosis.",eng,1.0

This review addresses the difficulties in managing acute pain in this growing group of patients and discusses evidence relating to opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia and new avenues of research in specific painful conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: There is accumulating evidence surrounding the dangers of high-dose opioids and the risk of overdose and death. Employing nonopioid analgesics and disease-modifying drugs to cover an acute exacerbation of pain will thus limit escalating opioid doses. In specific diseases, the role of oxidative stress and the disruption of calcium homeostasis may provide treatment targets in acute pancreatitis; the identification of psychological stressors may decrease the frequency of acute exacerbations of abdominal pain; modifying the adhesion of sickle cells to inflamed endothelium may reduce vaso-occlusive crises; while vertebroplasty and calcitonin appear to improve pain and functioning after osteoporotic vertebral fractures.

The purpose of this study was to explore whether the presence of focal-point tenderness over a fracture treated with vertebroplasty predicts superior clinical outcome as compared with outcomes in patients without such tenderness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we divided patients into 3 groups on the basis of pain patterns noted during history and physical examination before an initial vertebroplasty in 534 consecutive patients. Group 1 comprised 373 (70%) of 534 patients with focal-point tenderness over the treated fractures. Group 2 comprised 119 (22%) patients with focal-point tenderness over the treated fractures as well as subjective off-midline pain or focal tenderness to palpation over nontreated vertebrae. Group 3 comprised 42 (8%) patients without focal-point tenderness over the treated fractures but with subjective off-midline pain or tenderness to palpation over nontreated vertebrae. Outcomes included pain at rest and with activity as well as the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score. Statistical tools included the 2-tailed t test with a Bonferroni adjustment. RESULTS: Baseline pain at rest and with activity was not different among groups, but the proportion of group 3 patients maintained on a narcotic anesthesia preprocedure was less than that of groups 1 and 2 (P = .02 compared with both groups).

We sought to define the impact of preprocedural pain duration on outcomes, including pain relief, improvement in function, and medication usage among patients treated with single-level vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained before conducting this retrospective analysis of 321 patients undergoing single-level vertebroplasty at our institution. Fractures were categorized as acute (</=6 weeks, n = 153), subacute (6-24 weeks, n = 124), and chronic (>24 weeks, n = 44). Pain NRS (0-10) scores at rest and with activity and RDS were compared among 3 groups at baseline and post procedure. Also absolute and proportional improvement of pain NRS and RDS were compared among 3 groups by using ANOVA. Linear regression was performed between preoperative pain duration and symptom improvement for each group. RESULTS: Baseline RDS and pain NRS with activity and at rest were not significantly different among groups (P = .09, .30, and .91, respectively). Mean improvement in pain NRS with activity at 1 month postvertebroplasty in acute (improvement = 4.9 +/- 3.5), subacute (improvement = 4.2 +/- 3.2), and chronic fractures (improvement = 4.5 +/- 3.2) was similar among groups (P = .28). Mean improvement in RDS at 1 month postprocedure was 9.6, 8.3, and 9.9, for acute, subacute, and chronic fractures, respectively (P = .56).

METHODS/RESULTS: Here we report a patient who presented with an incidental finding of pulmonary embolization after kyphoplasty and review the relevant literature. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who present with symptoms of respiratory distress after kyphoplasty should undergo workup for pulmonary embolism. Clinicians may consider routine postoperative chest radiographs after kyphoplasty to screen for embolic disease. Further research is necessary to identify the risk factors and possible long-term sequelae of cement embolization.,eng,0.0

Freiman,2012.0,Percutaneous augmented instrumentation of unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures,10.1007/s00586-011-2106-x,"BACKGROUND: Internal fixation of unstable thoracolumbar spine fractures requires correction of the lacking anterior column support. This usually entails insertion of a vertebral body replacement strut through an anterior approach, or a long posterior construct spanning at least two vertebrae above and two vertebrae below the fracture. Posterior short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI)--one vertebra above and below--is suitable for approximately 40% of fractures, but not for all. METHODS: A total of 52 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures meeting our inclusion criteria were instrumented using a novel approach, combining percutaneous SSPI, pedicle screw augmentation with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and fractured vertebra kyphoplasty. We retrospectively reviewed patient and fracture data, operative results and 1 year radiographic follow-up postoperatively in 40 of the patients. We reviewed operative complications of all 52 patients. RESULTS: Most fractures were AO/Magerl type A3.1, A3.2 and A3.3. They were instrumented within 72 h and ambulated without additional external bracing. Operative time averaged 2 h and blood loss was less than 50 cc in most cases. Complications were mostly related to PMMA leakage. On average, 3.3 degrees (0-13) of correction was lost after 3 months, but remained constant afterward. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous augmented short-segment pedicle instrumentation of unstable thoracolumbar fractures can be done with short operative times, minimal blood loss and a low complication rate. The radiographical results at 1 year are equal to anterior stabilization and are better than other posterior-only techniques.",eng,0.0

Szerlip,2015.0,Predictors of delayed failure of structural kyphoplasty for pathological compression fractures in cancer patients,10.3171/2014.11.spine14909,"OBJECT Pathological compression fractures in cancer patients cause significant pain and disability. Spinal metastases affect quality of life near the end of life and may require multiple procedures, including medical palliative care and open surgical decompression and fixation. An increasingly popular minimally invasive technique to treat metastatic instabilities is kyphoplasty. Even though it may alleviate pain due to pathological fractures, it may fail. However, delayed kyphoplasty failures with retropulsed cement and neural element compression have not been well reported. Such failures necessitate open surgical decompression and stabilization, and cement inserted during the kyphoplasty complicates salvage surgeries in patients with a disease-burdened spine. The authors sought to examine the incidence of delayed failure of structural kyphoplasty in a series of cement augmentations for pathological compression fractures. The goal was to identify risk predictors by analyzing patient and disease characteristics to reduce kyphoplasty failure and to prevent excessive surgical procedures at the end of life. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with metastatic cancer from 2010 to 2013 who had undergone a procedure involving cement augmentation for a pathological compression fracture at their institution. The authors examined the characteristics of the patients, diseases, and radiographic fractures. RESULTS In total, 37 patients underwent cement augmentation in 75 spinal levels during 45 surgeries. Four patients had delayed structural kyphoplasty failure necessitating surgical decompression and fusion. The mean time to kyphoplasty failure was 2.88 +/- 1.24 months. The mean loss of vertebral body height was 16% in the patients in whom kyphoplasty failed and 32% in patients in whom kyphoplasty did not fail. No posterior intraoperative cement extravasation was observed in the patients in whom kyphoplasty had failed. The mean spinal instability neoplastic score was 10.8 in the patients in whom kyphoplasty failed and 10.1 in those in whom kyphoplasty did not fail. Approximately 50% of the kyphoplasty failures occurred at junctional spinal levels. All the patients in whom kyphoplasty failed had fractures in 3 or more cortical walls before treatment, whereas 46% of patients in the nonfailure group had fractures with breaching of 3 or more walls. CONCLUSIONS Although rare, delayed failures of structural augmentation with cement during kyphoplasty do occur and can lead to additional surgeries. A possible predictive index may include wall integrity of the vertebral body, competency of the posterior tension band, and location of the kyphoplasty at a junctional spinal level. Additional studies are required to confirm these findings.",eng,0.0

Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is used to stabilize vertebral collapse and treat the pain. Few studies have been carried out on PVP in MM and follow-up has tended to be short. We have prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of PVP in the VCFs resulting from MM or plasmacytomas. Nineteen PVP were performed in 12 consecutive patients. We monitored their pain and functional status using visual analog (VAS) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale, respectively. For a subjective assessment, every patient was asked about his/her degree of satisfaction. The mean age of the participants was 66 yr. Significant improvement occurred 1 d after PVP according to the VAS score (7.5 pre-PVP to 3.7, P < 0.0001) and ECOG assessment (3.1 to 2.5, P = 0.002). This significant improvement was maintained after 3.2 yr of follow-up. Sixty-three percent of patients were highly satisfied with the result of the PVP and 37% were satisfied. The peri-operative mortality was 0%. Leakage of the cement outside of the vertebral body was noted in 16 of 19 injected vertebrae (84%) but none of the patients developed any clinical or neurological symptoms. At the last follow-up, no further collapse in the treated or neighboring vertebrae was noted. VCFs caused by MM or plasmacytomas can be effectively treated by vertebroplasty. PVP is associated with early clinical improvement of pain and function and can be maintained after a long follow-up without major procedure-related complications.",eng,1.0

In intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, several approaches are used for handling the missing information - complete case (CC) analysis, mixed-effects model (MM) analysis, last observation carried forward (LOCF) and multiple imputation (MI). This report discusses the consequences of applying the CC, LOCF and MI for the ITT analysis of published data (analysed using the MM method) from the Fracture Reduction Evaluation (FREE) trial. METHODS: The FREE trial was a randomised, non-blinded study comparing balloon kyphoplasty with non-surgical care for the treatment of patients with acute painful vertebral fractures. Patients were randomised to treatment (1:1 ratio), and stratified for gender, fracture aetiology, use of bisphosphonates and use of systemic steroids at the time of enrolment. Six outcome measures - Short-form 36 physical component summary (SF-36 PCS) scale, EuroQol 5-Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D), Roland-Morris Disability (RMD) score, back pain, number of days with restricted activity in last 2 weeks, and number of days in bed in last 2 weeks - were analysed using four methods for dealing with missing data: CC, LOCF, MM and MI analyses. RESULTS: There were no missing data in baseline covariates values, and only a few missing baseline values in outcome variables. The overall missing-response level increased during follow-up (1 month: 14.5%; 24 months: 28%), corresponding to a mean of 19% missing data during the entire period. Overall patterns of missing response across time were similar for each treatment group. Almost half of all randomised patients were not available for a CC analysis, a maximum of 4% were not included in the LOCF analysis, and all randomised patients were included in the MM and MI analyses. Improved estimates of treatment effect were observed with LOCF, MM and MI compared with CC; only MM provided improved estimates across all six outcomes considered. CONCLUSIONS: The FREE trial results are robust as the alternative methods used for substituting missing data produced similar results. The MM method showed the highest statistical precision suggesting it is the most appropriate method to use for analysing the FREE trial data.

The goals include procuring bone mass and preventing injury: back support, physical therapy, occupational therapy, psychosocial support, and prevention of falls. Initial treatment includes bed rest, pain management with local and systemic analgesia, bracing to improve comfort, and patient reassurance. Long-term management includes spinal stretching exercises and continuing ordinary activities within limits permitted by pain. A back school program is an effective addition to conventional concepts using physiotherapy exclusively.

The intensity of pain was followed-up on the VAS scale before surgery, 24 hours after surgery and three months after surgery. The cement was applied in 55 patients (43 women, 12 men). The average age of the tests was 68.43 years (38 to 82 years). Fifty five procedures were implemented on 85 vertebrae, i.e. 32 metastatic fractures and 23 osteoporotic fractures. The procedures were applied on 28 thoracal and 57 lumbar vertebrae. The average VAS before surgery was 8.36 and 2.23 (p < 0.005) 24 hours after surgery, and it remained almost unchanged three months later. There were 1 serious complication, a paraparesis caused by the leakage of cement into the spinal canal, which was partially recovered after decompression and rehabilitation treatment, and 2 superficial infections with S. epidermidis which were cured by means of antibiotics. By means of Wilcoxon paired test a significant difference was found between the preoperative VAS and the value 24 hours after surgery (n = 55, Z = 6.451, p < 0.00001) and 3 months after surgery (Z = 6.45, p < = 0.00001), while there was a compliance between two VAS measurements after surgery (Z = 1.308, p = 0.191) which indicates that the fast pain reduction remained stable during the 3 month follow-up.

However, management of that pain with conventional medical, radiotherapy, or surgical modalities is often inadequate. Vertebral augmentation techniques, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, are minimally invasive techniques in which methylmethacrylate bone cement is percutaneously injected into compressed vertebral bodies. Vertebral augmentation often improves mechanical stability of compressed vertebrae, provides pain relief, and may prevent progression of vertebral collapse. Kyphoplasty may provide increased chance for vertebral body height restoration, but the clinical importance of slight change in vertebral body height is unclear. Vertebral augmentation can be used in conjunction with other treatment modalities, and associated pain relief may improve patient tolerance of needed antitumor therapies, such as radiation therapy. Vertebral augmentation is generally very well tolerated, and complications associated with bone cement extravasation beyond the vertebral body have rarely been reported. Because it often provides good to excellent relief of otherwise intractable pain and is generally well tolerated, vertebral augmentation is becoming a first-line agent for management of painful vertebral compression fractures, especially in the setting of malignant disease.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVES: Clinicians use methylmethacrylate vertebroplasty to treat vertebral hemangiomas, metastases, and osteoporotic fractures. Cement may leak out of the vertebral body and compress the adjacent spinal cord and nerve roots. We review a case of nerve-root and cord compression from methylmethacrylate extrusion during vertebroplasty.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A 50-year-old female presented with disabling thoracic back pain. A metastasis to T1 was discovered, with collapse of the vertebral body but without cord compression. Methylmethacrylate vertebroplasty was performed. After injection, portable computed tomography (CT) showed a leakage of methylmethacrylate into the C8 and T1 foramina and spinal canal. Radiculopathy and myelopathy developed. Surgical decompression using the anterior approach was necessary.
METHODS: Case report.
RESULTS: Early surgical intervention decompressed the neural elements and relieved the neurological deficits.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of 28 consecutive patients with multiple myeloma (19 men, nine women; age range, 51-73 years; mean age, 60 years) who underwent WB-MDCT and conventional radiography (CR) of the skeleton. The images were interpreted for the presence of bony lesions, medullary lesions, fractures and extraosseous lesions. We evaluated any changes in treatment planning as a result of WB-MDCT findings. RESULTS: WB-MDCT was superior to CR for detecting bony lesions (p=0.001), especially of the spine (p=0.001) and thoracic cage (p=0.006). WB-MDCT upstaged 14 patients, with a significant difference in staging (p=0.002) between WB-MDCT and CR. Medullary involvement either focal (n=6) or diffuse (n=3) had a positive correlation with the overall score (r=0.790) and stage (r=0.618) of disease. Spine fractures were better detected at WB-MDCT (n=4) than at CR (n=2). Extraosseous soft tissue lesions (n=7) were detected only at WB-MDCT. Findings detected at the WB-MDCT led to changes in the patient's treatment plan in 39% of cases. Upstaging of seven patients (25%) altered the medical treatment plan, and four of 28 (14%) patients required additional radiotherapy (7%) and vertebroplasty (7%). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that WB-MDCT has an impact on treatment planning and prognosis in patients with multiple myeloma, as it has high rate of detecting cortical and medullary bone lesions, spinal fracture and extraosseous lesions. This information may alter treatment planning in multiple myeloma due to disease upstaging and detection of spine fracture and extraosseous spinal lesions.",eng,1.0

Both uni- and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups showed significant within-group improvements in all clinical outcomes at three months and twelve months after surgery. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in all clinical and radiological outcomes. Operating time was longer in the bipedicular group (p < 0.001). The incidence of cement leakage was not significantly different in the two groups (p = 0.09).

A total of 158 (18,3%) thoracic, 595 (68,8%) thoracolumbar, and 112 (12,9%) lumbar spine injuries were treated. Of these, 733 patients received operative treatment (OP group). Fifty-two patients were treated non-operatively and 69 patients were treated with kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty without additional instrumentation (Plasty group).

The average spinal canal narrowing in patients with a complete spinal cord injury (Frankel/ASIA A) was calculated to be 70%, vs. 50% in patients with incomplete neurologic deficits (Frankel/ASIA B-D), and 20% in patients without neurologic deficits (Frankel/ASIS E; p<0,001). The average procedure in the plasty treatment subgroup was 50 min (18-145 min) to address one (n=59) or two (n=10) injured vertebral bodies. In patients with nonoperative treatment mainly three-point-corsets (n=36) were administered for a duration of 6-12 weeks. During their hospital stay 93 of 195 (44,7%) patients with initial neurologic deficits improved at least one Frankel/ASIA grade until the day of discharge. Two patients (0,2%) showed a neurologic deterioration. The highest rate of complete spinal cord injury (n=36, 23%) was associated with thoracic spine injuries. Nine (1%) patients died during the initial course of treatment. A total of 105 (14,3%) cases with intraoperative (n=56) and/or postoperative complications (n=69) were registered. The most common intraoperative complication was bleeding (n=35, 4,8%). A higher relative frequency of intraoperative complications was noticed in combined (n=34, 10,7%) vs. isolated posterior (n=22, 5,9%; p=0,021) procedures. The most common postoperative complication was associated with wound healing problems in 14 (1,9%) patients. Except in the non-operative treatment subgroup, a correction of the posttraumatic measured radiological deformity was achieved to a different extent within every treatment subgroup. There were no statistically significant differences between the postoperative radiological results of the treatment subgroups (dorsal vs. combination), taking into consideration the influence of relevant parameters such as different fracture types, patient age, and the amount of posttraumatic deformity (p=0,34, ANOVA).",ger,0.0

Its main objective is the evaluation and optimization of the operative treatment for traumatic spinal injuries. The authors present the results of the second prospective internet-based multicenter study (MCS II) of the AG WS in three consecutive parts: epidemiology, surgical treatment and radiologic findings and follow-up results. The aim of the study was to update and review the state-of-the art for treatment of spinal fractures for thoracic and lumbar spine (T1-L5) injuries in German-speaking countries: which lesions will be treated with which procedure and what differences can be found in the course of treatment and the clinical and radiological outcome? This present first part of the study outlines the new study design and concept of an internet-based data collection system. The epidemiologic findings and characteristics of the three major treatment subgroups of the study collective will be presented: operative treatment (OP), non-operative treatment (KONS), and patients receiving a kyphoplasty and/or vertebroplasty without additional instrumentation (PLASTIE). A total of 865 patients (OP n=733, KONS n=52, PLASTIE n=69, other n=7) from 8 German and Austrian trauma centers were included. The main causes of accidents in the OP subgroup were motor vehicle accidents 27.1% and trivial falls 15.8% (KONS 55.8%, PLASTIE 66.7%). The Magerl/AO classification scheme was used and 548 (63.3%) compression fractures (type A), 181 (20.9%) distraction injuries (type B), and 136 (15.7%) rotational injuries (type C) were diagnosed. Of the fractures 68.8% were located at the thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2). Type B and type C injuries carried a higher risk for concomitant injuries, neurological deficits and additional vertebral fractures. The average initial VAS spine score, representing the status before the trauma, varied between treatment subgroups (OP 80, KONS 75, PLASTIE 72) and declined with increasing patient age (p<0.01).",ger,0.0

Pain is probably caused by collapse of the porous bone resulting in instability of the vertebra. Stabilization of the vertebra by injecting cement results in a clear improvement in the complaint and a clear reduction in pain resulting in better mobilization. Recent results have, however, cast doubt on the effectiveness of this therapy. Diagnostic nerve blocks on the spinal column are important because the pain is mostly clinically uncharacteristic, the innervation is complex and the pain is subjective. An exact classification can be made using special nerve blocks. Prerequisites for the use of diagnostic nerve blocks are an extensive clinical history and examination of the patient before nerve blocks are carried out. In approximately 15-45% of patients the zygapophyseal joint is the cause of the back pain. Anesthesia of the zygapophyseal joint can be carried out by direct intra-articular application of a local anesthetic or by a block of the medial branch of the posterior branch of each of two spinal nerves. The simplest method is by computed tomography-guided zygapophyseal block.",ger,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlative factors affecting the complications of percutaneous kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Over the past decade, percutaneous kyphoplasty has been increasingly used as treatment of choice for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. However, current literature contains less information about the correlative factors affecting the complications resulted from cement leakage. METHODS: In all, 71 patients with 171 vertebral compression fractures who were treated by percutaneous kyphoplasty in the department of spine surgery at our medical center were identified from the registry and were retrospectively reviewed. The treatment efficacy was determined by the assessment of change in vertebral body height, Cobb angle, visual analog scale and Oswestry functional score between preoperative, postoperative, and the latest follow-up. Complications were recorded and associated risk factors were determined and analyzed. RESULTS: All patients had immediate and significant improvement in back pain after being treated with percutaneous kyphoplasty. Cement leakage occurred in 17 (9.94%) out of 171 vertebral bodies, including 7 paravertebral leaks, 6 leaks into intervertebral space, 3 leaks into channel of needling insertion, and 1 spinal canal leak. Four patients (5.63%) developed pulmonary complications postoperatively, one of them with confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism directly caused by cement leakage. During the follow-up, we found 9 recurrence vertebral fractures in 6 patients (8.45%), including 6 adjacent vertebral bodies. Univariate analysis revealed a significant difference in preoperative vertebral body height, injected cement volume, and vertebral body wall incompetence between the cement leakage group and no cement leakage group (P<0.05). In contrast, there is no significant difference in the preoperative Cobb angle, freshness of vertebral fracture, location of operative vertebrae, and operative approach between the 2 groups (P>0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the injected cement volume and vertebral body wall incompetence were the predominant variables associated with the complications resulting from cement leakage. The patients who had a history of pulmonary diseases were prone to develop lung-related complications after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The cement viscosity, injected cement volume, vertebral body wall incompetence, and a history of pulmonary diseases were the factors affecting the complications resulting from cement leakage. The recognition of these risk factors is helpful in efforts to improve surgical technique to reduce the risk of complications after being treated by percutaneous kyphoplasty.",eng,0.0

METHODS: The clinical data of patients with Kummell's disease undergoing percutaneous vertebroplasty via unilateral or bilateral approach between January, 2006 and January, 2011 were reviewed. The clinical efficacy, operation time, bone cement injection volume, incidence of cement leakage, degree of vertebral height restoration, and degree of kyphosis correction were compared between the patients receiving surgery via the two approaches. RESULTS: The operation time was shorter in the unipedicular group than in the bipedicular group (P<0.05), but bone cement injection volume, incidence of cement leakage, degree of anterior vertebral height restoration, degree of middle vertebral height restoration, degree of kyphosis correction, and VAS scores were all comparable between the two groups (P>0.05). In both groups, the VAS scores at 24 h, 3 months and at the last follow-up after the surgery were lowered compared to the preoperative scores (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Both unipedicular and bipedicular percutaneous vertebroplasty can achieve satisfactory analgesia in the treatment of Kummell's disease with similar clinical efficacy.

METHODS: From June 2005 to January 2011, patients with osteoporotic VCFs (OVCFs) who were treated with PVP and met this study's inclusion criteria were retrospectively reviewed. Observed parameters were age, sex, bone mineral density, body mass index, amount of bone cement, cement leakage into the disk, preoperative kyphosis, preoperative degree of anterior vertebral compression, preoperative degree of middle vertebral compression, kyphosis correction, anterior vertebral height restoration, middle vertebral height restoration, and number of initial symptomatic fractures (levels treated). The data were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis for the emergence of new fractures after PVP to determine related risk factors. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 155 female and 27 male patients with a mean age of 69.7 years (range 49-91 years). The follow-up period was 24-50 months (average 26.4 months). A total of 294 VCFs among 182 patients were observed, 28 new VCFs occurred in 21 patients (21/182, 11.5 %) during the follow-up period. Statistical analysis indicated that higher BMI (P = 0.004) and a greater number of initial symptomatic fractures (P = 0.017) were significantly associated with new VCFs after PVP. It is the most obvious that the risk of new fractures increased 2.518-fold (95 % CI 1.176-5.395), when the number of initial VCFs increased by one level.

Patwardhan,2011.0,Restoration of spinal alignment and disk mechanics following polyetheretherketone wafer kyphoplasty with StaXx FX,10.3174/ajnr.A2484,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: EPFs sustained during VCFs degrade the disk's ability to develop IDP under load. This inability to develop pressure in combination with residual kyphotic deformity increases the risk for adjacent vertebral fractures. We tested the hypothesis that StaXx FX reduces kyphosis and endplate deformity following vertebral compression fracture, restoring disk mechanics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight thoracolumbar, 5-vertebrae segments were tested. A void was selectively created in the middle vertebra. The specimens were compressed until EPF and to a grade I-II VCF. PEEK wafer kyphoplasty was then performed. The specimens were then tested in flexion-extension (+/-6 Nm) under 400-N preload intact, after EPF, VCF, and kyphoplasty. Endplate deformity, kyphosis, and IDP adjacent to the fractured body were measured. RESULTS: Vertebral body height at the point of maximal endplate deformity decreased after EPF and VCF and was partially corrected after StaXx FX, remaining less than intact (P = .047). Anterior vertebral height decreased after VCF (P = .002) and was partially restored with StaXx FX, remaining less than intact (P = .015). Vertebral kyphosis increased after VCF (P < .001) and reduced after StaXx FX, remaining greater than intact (P = .03). EPF reduced IDP in the affected disk in compression-flexion loading (P < .001), which was restored after StaXx FX (P = 1.0). IDP in the unaffected disk did not change during testing (P > .3). CONCLUSIONS: StaXx FX reduced endplate deformity and kyphosis, and significantly increased anterior height following VCF. Although height and kyphosis were not fully corrected, the disk's ability to pressurize under load was restored.",eng,0.0

New vertebral compression fracture (NVCF) has been noted as a potential late sequela of the procedures. The incidence of NVCFs and affecting risk factors were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed the occurrence of NVCFs in 147 patients treated with PVP or PKP for osteoporotic VCFs. Possible risk factors, such as age, gender, body mass index, bone mineral density (BMD), location of treated vertebra, treatment modality, amount of bone cement injected, anterior-posterior ratio of the fractured vertebra, cement leakage into the disc space, and pattern of cement distribution, were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (18.4%) had subsequent symptomatic NVCFs with a median time to new fracture was of 70 days. The 1-year symptomatic fracture-free rate was 85.0% by the Kaplan-Meier estimate. Eighteen (66.7%) of the 27 patients had an NVCF on the adjacent vertebra. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between the NVCF and control groups in regard to age, treatment modality, BMD, and the proportion of cement leakage into the disc space.

Addressing the challenges of this shift, we integrate the fluoroscopic studies of these percutaneous approaches with the three-dimensional surgical anatomy. Step-by-step techniques are illustrated in video demonstrations that highlight the nuances of effective percutaneous access during spinal surgeries for vertebral compression fractures and pedicle screw fixation. METHODS: Imaging guidelines, approach planning, surgical techniques, and relevant anatomical features are noted for the transpedicular, lumbar extrapedicular, and thoracic extra- and infrapedicular approaches. Video clips and accompanying fluoroscopic images highlight the critical steps. Subtle refinements unique to each percutaneous access are presented related to skin incision, needle trajectory, and cement deposition. RESULTS: With the transpedicular approach (popular technique for vertebroplasty and pedicle screw placement), safe access requires accurate interpretation of the fluoroscopic anatomy, specifically identification of the target vertebral body in true anterior-posterior and lateral planes. The transpedicular trajectory uses the slight inferior and medial orientation of the pedicle followed anteriorly. The lumbar extrapedicular approach uses an oblique trajectory anterior to the transverse process at the level of the pedicles. A thoracic approach uses the potential space between the rib head, transverse process, and pedicle. The infrapedicular approach, which allows greater flexibility in its medial angulation but at the expense of the bony confines of the thoracic extrapedicular approach, takes advantage of the narrow-waisted thoracic laminae. CONCLUSIONS: With an appreciation for the standard anatomical landmarks, fluoroscopic views, and avenues of approach, percutaneous access techniques can be safely and effectively applied to many spinal procedures.",eng,0.0

At first, conservative treatment still is the method of choice. In case of resulting deformity, sintering and persistent pain vertebral cement augmentation techniques today are widely used. Open correction of resulting deformity by different types of osteotomies addresses sagittal balance, but has comparably high morbidity. Besides conventional vertebral cement augmentation techniques balloon kyphoplasty has become a popular tool to address painful thoracic and lumbar compression fractures. It showed improved pain reduction and lower complication rates compared to standard vertebroplasty. Interestingly the results of two placebo-controlled vertebroplasty studies question the value of cement augmentation, if compared to a sham operation. Even though there exists now favourable data for kyphoplasty from one randomised controlled trial, the absence of a sham group leaves the placebo effect unaddressed. Technically kyphoplasty can be performed with a transpedicular or extrapedicular access. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-cement should be favoured, since calcium phosphate cement showed inferior biomechanical properties and less effect on pain reduction especially in less stable burst fractures.

Thus many practitioners are uncertain on the recommendation for cement augmentation techniques in elderly patients with osteoporotic VCF. This systematic review analyses randomised controlled trials on vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty to provide an overview on the current evidence. From an electronic database research 8 studies could be identified meeting our inclusion criteria of osteoporotic VCF in elderly (age>60 years), treatment with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, controlled with placebo or standard medical therapy, quality of life, function, or pain as primary parameter, and randomisation. Only two studies were properly blinded using a sham-operation as control. The other studies were using a non-surgical treatment control group. Further possible bias may be caused by manufacturer involvement in financing of three published RCT. There is level Ib evidence that vertebroplasty is no better than placebo, which is conflicting with the available level IIb evidence that there is a positive short-term effect of cement augmentation compared to standard medical therapy with regard to QoL, function and pain. Kyphoplasty is not superior to vertebroplasty with regard to pain, but with regard to VCF reduction (evidence level IIb). Kyphoplasty is probably not cost-effective (evidence level IIb), and vertebroplasty has not more than short-term cost-effectiveness (evidence level IV). Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty cannot be recommended as standard treatment for osteoporotic VCF. Ongoing sham-controlled trials may provide further evidence in this regard.",eng,0.0

The biomechanical literature suggests that cement filling volumes may play an important role in the dosage"" of vertebral augmentation and its pain alleviating effect. Good clinical data about filling volumes are scarce and most patient series are small. Therefore, we investigated the predictors of pain alleviation after balloon kyphoplasty in the nationwide SWISSspine registry where cement volumes are also recorded. METHODS: All single-level vertebral fractures with no additional fracture stabilization and availability of at least one follow-up within 6 months after surgery were included. The following potential predictors were assessed in a multivariate logistic regression model with the group's average pain alleviation of 41 points on VAS as the desired outcome: patient age, patient sex, diagnosis, preoperative pain, level of fracture, type of fracture, age of fracture, segmental kyphotic deformity, cement volume, vertebral body filling volume, and cement extrusions. RESULTS: There were 194 female and 82 males with an average age of 70.4 and 65.3 years, respectively. Female patients were about twice as likely for achieving the average pain relief compared to males (p = 0.04). The preoperative pain level was the strongest predictor in that the likelihood for achieving an at least 41-point pain relief increased by about 8 % with each additional point of preoperative pain (p < 0.001). A thoraco-lumbar fracture had a three times higher odds for the average pain relief compared with a lumbar fracture (p = 0.03). An A.3.1 fracture only had about a third of the probability for average pain relief compared with an A.1.1 fracture (p = 0.004). Cement volumes up to 4.5 ml only had an approximately 40 % chance for a minimum 41-point pain alleviation as compared with cement volumes of at least 4.5 ml (p = 0.007). In addition, the relationship between cement volume and pain alleviation followed a dose-dependent pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Cement volume was revealed as a significant predictor for pain relief in BKP. Cement volume was the third most important influential covariate and the most important modifiable and operator dependent one. The clear dose-outcome relationship between cement filling volumes and pain relief additionally supports these findings. Cement volumes of >4.5 ml seem to be recommendable for achieving relevant pain alleviation. Patient sex and fracture type and location were further significant predictors and all these covariates should be recorded and reported in future studies about the pain alleviating effectiveness of vertebral augmentation procedures.""",eng,1.0

Cements exhibiting lower viscosities and longer setting times are desired to overcome the difficulty of forcing the dough through small gauge needles and to reduce the risk of cementing them during surgery. However, cement extravasation is of great concern and can result when cements exhibiting lower viscosities are used. Therefore, the viscosity of cements should also be highly pseudoplastic to simultaneously facilitate flow through needles (shear-thinning) and inhibit potentially deleterious extravasation by viscosity recovery at the delivery sites. The viscosity of two-solution bone cement can be manipulated by changes in the polymer-to-monomer ratio and by the incorporation of cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate), (PMMA), microspheres or nanospheres in the polymer phase. In this study, the effect of the addition of cross-linked PMMA particles to the linear polymer-monomer solution with particle sizes ranging from 20-100 microm (microspheres) and 300-330 nm (nanospheres) is evaluated in terms of cement rheological properties and setting behavior.

Besides high radiopacity, it is desirable for the cement to have relatively low viscosity, high compressive strength and appropriate curing parameters. In this study, the properties of novel two-solution bone cements composed of cross-linked poly (methyl methacrylate) PMMA microspheres or nanospheres added to the linear polymer phase were assessed for formulations with increasing concentrations of zirconium dioxide (ZrO(2)). The addition of a cross-linked phase in the standard two-solution formulation (TSBC) was observed to improve the material properties by increasing setting time and decreasing maximum polymerization temperatures and decreasing the initial viscosity in comparison to the standard cement. The properties of three formulations (TSBC, modified two-solution containing cross-linked PMMA microspheres, and nanospheres) were measured for cements prepared at 0%, 5%, 20%, and 30% ZrO(2) and compared to KyphX. Cements prepared with cross-linked particles exhibited significantly higher compressive strength than the standard-two solution cement and KyphX at increasing radiopacifier concentrations. Furthermore, cement viscosity was increased by the addition of increasing concentrations of ZrO(2) in the modified two-solution cements, whereas the maximum polymerization exotherm and setting time of these materials were decreased. This study indicates that the addition of high concentrations of ZrO(2) significantly affects the properties of two-solution cements acting as a reinforcing phase when cross-linked spheres are added. These materials were observed to be suitable for vertebroplasty applications.",eng,0.0

Additionally, strength and stiffness restoration are controversial varying with the cement type, volume injected, and technique used.
PURPOSE: To investigate maximum polymerization temperatures and mechanical performance of novel two-solution bone cement (TSBC) modified by the addition of cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate) nanospheres (eta-TSBC) and microspheres (mu-TSBC) in a cadaver vertebroplasty model in comparison to a commercially available cement (KyphX). To study the viability of application of these novel cement formulations in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Ex vivo biomechanical and exothermal evaluation of TSBCs using cadaveric vertebral bodies (VBs).
METHODS: Thirty-one cadaveric vertebrae (age, 74+/-2 years; T score, -1.5+/-0.5) were disarticulated. Thirteen vertebrae were assigned into three groups and instrumented with thermocouples positioned midbody along the intersection of the midsagittal and midcoronal axes, as well as along the intersection of the midsagittal axis and posterior VB wall. After equilibration at 37degreeC, 5 mL of cement was injected and temperatures were recorded for 1 hour. The groups were injected with eta-TSBC, mu-TSBC, or KyphX. The remaining 18 vertebrae were biomechanically tested. After randomization into three groups, each specimen was fractured in compression and stabilized with 5 mL of each cement type. Each specimen was then retested in axial compression.
RESULTS: Temperatures in the central region of the vertebrae were significantly lower (p<.05) when injected with eta-TSBC (44degreeC) in comparison to KyphX (75degreeC) and mu-TSBC (64degreeC). A significant difference was not detected between the pre- and postcementing strength (p>.05) of the three groups. There was no significant difference between the average values of stiffness among the cements (p>.05), however there was a significant difference between intact and treated stiffness (p<.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The TSBC cements decreased the local temperature within the VB while providing similar mechanical strength when compared with vertebrae treated with KyphX.

We searched multiple electronic databases to March 2016 for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing BK with control treatment (nonsurgical management [NSM], percutaneous vertebroplasty [PV], KIVA VCF treatment system [Benvenue Medical, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA], vertebral body stenting, or other) in adults with VCF. Outcomes included back pain, back disability, quality of life, new VCF, and adverse events (AEs). One reviewer extracted data, a second checked accuracy, and two rated risk of bias (ROB). Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using inverse-variance models. Risk ratios of new VCF and AE were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel models. Ten unique trials enrolled 1837 participants (age range, 61 to 76 years; 74% female), all rated as having high or uncertain ROB. Versus NSM, BK was associated with greater reductions in pain, back-related disability, and better quality of life (k = 1 trial) that appeared to lessen over time, but were less than minimally clinically important differences. Risk of new VCF at 3 and 12 months was not significantly different (k = 2 trials). Risk of any AE was increased at 1 month (RR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36 to 2.21). There were no significant differences between BK and PV in back pain, back disability, quality of life, risk of new VCF, or any AE (k = 1 to 3 trials). Limitations included lack of a BK versus sham comparison, availability of only one RCT of BK versus NSM, and lack of study blinding. Individuals with painful VCF experienced symptomatic improvement compared with baseline with all interventions. The clinical importance of the greater improvements with BK versus NSM is unclear, may be due to placebo effect, and may not counterbalance short-term AE risks. Outcomes appeared similar between BK and other surgical interventions. Well-conducted randomized trials comparing BK with sham would help resolve remaining uncertainty about the relative benefits and harms of BK.

Several parameters, including fracture type, cement filling shape, cement volume, elastic moduli of cement, cancellous bone and fractured region, may all affect the stresses in the augmented vertebral body and in bone cement. The aim of this study was to determine numerically the effects of these input parameters on the stresses caused. In a probabilistic finite element study, an osteoligamentous model of the lumbar spine was employed. Seven input parameters were simultaneously and randomly varied within appropriate limits for >110 combinations thereof. The maximum von Mises stresses in cancellous and cortical bone of the treated vertebral body L3 and in bone cement were calculated. The loading cases standing, flexion, extension, lateral bending, axial rotation and walking were simulated. In a subsequent sensitivity analysis, the coefficients of correlation and determination of the input parameters on the von Mises stresses were calculated. The loading case has a strong influence on the maximum von Mises stress. In cancellous bone, the median value of the maximum von Mises stresses for the different input parameter combinations varied between 1.5 (standing) and 4.5 MPa (flexion). The ranges of the stresses are large for all loading cases studied. Depending on the loading case, up to 69% of the maximum stress variation could be explained by the seven input parameters. The fracture shape and the elastic modulus of the fractured region have the highest influence. In cortical bone, the median values of the maximum von Mises stresses varied between 31.1 (standing) and 61.8 MPa (flexion). The seven input parameters could explain up to 80% of the stress variation here. It is the fracture shape, which has always the highest influence on the stress variation. In bone cement, the median value of the maximum von Mises stresses varied between 3.8 (standing) and 12.7 MPa (flexion). Up to 75% of the maximum stress variation in cement could be explained by the seven input parameters. Fracture shape, and the elastic moduli of bone cement and of the fracture region are those input parameters with the highest influence on the stress variation. In the model with no fracture, the maximum von Mises stresses are generally low. The present probabilistic and sensitivity study clearly showed that in vertebroplasty the maximum stresses in the augmented vertebral body and in bone cement depend mainly on the loading case and fracture shape. Elastic moduli of cement, fracture region and cancellous bone as well as cement volume have sometimes a moderate effect while number and symmetry of cement plugs have virtually no effect on the maximum stresses.",eng,0.0

Bergmann,2006.0,Spinal loads after osteoporotic vertebral fractures treated by vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty,10.1007/s00586-005-0018-3,"Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are routine treatments for compression fractures of vertebral bodies. A wedge-shaped compression fracture shifts the centre of gravity of the upper body anteriorly and generally, this shift can be compensated in the spine and in the hips. However, it is still unclear how a wedge-shaped compression fracture of a vertebra increases forces in the trunk muscle and the intradiscal pressure in the adjacent discs. A nonlinear finite element model of the lumbar spine was used to estimate the force in the trunk muscle, the intradiscal pressure and the stresses in the endplates in the intact spine, and after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty treatment. In this study, kyphoplasty represents a treatment with nearly full fracture reduction and vertebroplasty one without restoration of kyphotic angle although in reality kyphoplasty does not guarantee fracture reduction. If no compensation of upper body shift is assumed, the force in the erector spine increases by about 200% for the vertebroplasty but by only 55% for the kyphoplasty compared to the intact spine. Intradiscal pressure increases by about 60 and 20% for the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, respectively. In contrast, with shift compensation of the upper body, the increase in muscle force is much lower and increase in intradiscal pressure is only about 20 and 7.5% for the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, respectively. Augmentation of the vertebral body with bone cement has a much smaller effect on intradiscal pressure. The increase in that case is only about 2.4% for the intact as well as for the fractured vertebra. Moreover, the effect of upper body shift after a wedge-shaped vertebral body fracture on intradiscal pressure and thus on spinal load is much more pronounced than that of stiffness increase due to cement infiltration. Maximum von Mises stress in the endplates of all lumbar vertebrae is also higher after kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. Cement augmentation has only a minor effect on endplate stresses in the unfractured vertebrae. The advantages of kyphoplasty found in this study will be apparent only if nearly full fracture reduction is achieved. Otherwise, differences between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty become small or vanish. Our results suggest that vertebral body fractures in the adjacent vertebrae after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty are not induced by the elevated stiffness of the treated vertebra, but instead the anterior shift of the upper body is the dominating factor.",eng,0.0

Zarghooni,2013.0,[Is height restoration possible with a comparatively smaller amount of cement in radiofrequency kyphoplasty using a monopedicle approach?],10.1055/s-0032-1328418,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous cement augmentation systems have been proven to be an effective treatment for vertebral compression fractures in the last 10 years. A special form available since 2009 is the radiofrequency kyphoplasty (RF) in which the applied energy raises the viscosity of the cement. The aim of this study is to find out if a smaller cement amount in radiofrequency kyphoplasty can also restore vertebral body height in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. METHODS: The treatment was minimally invasive using the StabiliT(R) vertebral augmentation system by DFine. In a retrospective study from 2011 to January 2012, 35 patients underwent RF kyphoplasty for 49 fresh osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. From the clinical side the parameters, demographics and pain relief using a visual analogue scale (VAS: 0 to 100 mm) were collected. For the radiological outcome the vertebral body height (anterior, mean and posterior vertebral body height with kyphosis angle) after surgery and after three months was measured and compared to the cement volume. RESULTS: All patients still had permanent pain on the fractured level after conservative treatment. The time from initial painful fracture to treatment was 3.0 weeks +/- 1.3. Average visual analogue scale results decreased significantly from 71 +/- 9.2 preoperatively to 35 +/- 6.2 postoperatively (p < 0.001) and to 30 +/- 5.7 (p < 0.001) after three months. With a mean cement volume in the thoracic spine of 2.9 +/- 0.7 ml (1.8-4.1) and lumbar spine of 3.0 +/- 0.7 ml (2.0-5.0) we had a significant vertebral body height restoration. Anterior and mean vertebral body heights significantly increased by an average of 2.3 and 3.1 mm, kyphosis angle significantly decreased with an average of 2.1 degrees at three-month follow-up (p < 0.05). In two vertebrae (4.1 %) a minimal asymptomatic cement leakage occurred into the upper disc. In two patients (5.7 %) we had new fractures in the directly adjacent segment that were also successfully treated with radiofrequency kyphoplasty. CONCLUSION: With a mean cement volume of 3.0 ml radiofrequency kyphoplasty achieves rapid and short-term improvements of clinical symptoms with a significant restoration of vertebral body height. There was no correlation between restoration of vertebral body height and pain relief. With a cement leakage of 4.1 % RF kyphoplasty is a safe and effective minimally invasive percutaneous cement augmentation procedure. Our data confirm the higher safety described in literature for kyphoplasty in contrast to vertebroplasty.",ger,0.0

When conservative treatment of these fractures fails, with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty we have two percutaneous minimally invasive stabilising procedures at our disposal. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 90 patients with fresh osteoporotic vertebral fractures who had been treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in our clinic between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. Clinical analysis included Oswestry score and VAS index; the vertebral body height restoration (mean vertebral body height, kyphosis angle, anterior/posterior edge) was evaluated radiologically; furthermore, all occurring complications were recorded. The follow-up time was 1 year, 80 patients could be examined at follow-up; 8 patients had died of a tumour disease, lost to follow-up were 2.2%. RESULTS: Both procedures succeeded in significantly (p<0.001) increasing quality of life (Oswestry score) and reducing pain (VAS). Following vertebroplasty there were two cases of cement leakage into the spinal canal with consecutive paraparesis which disappeared completely after the cement had been surgically removed. Altogether, 11 adjacent level fractures were observed, 4 in the vertebroplasty and 7 in the kyphoplasty group. CONCLUSION: This study compares vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty with regard to their effectiveness, safety, and restoration of vertebral body height, and complications. There were no differences between the groups with regard to quality of life and pain improvement, but the rate of serious complications was higher after vertebroplasty. Mean vertebral body height restoration at 1 year follow-up was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the kyphoplasty group.

Sobottke,2010.0,The present role of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty in the treatment of fresh vertebral compression fractures,", ","Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are minimally invasive vertebral augmentation procedures for the treatment of fresh vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) associated with osteoporosis, trauma, malignant conditions, hemangiomas, and osteonecrosis. During these procedures, bone cement (e.g., polymethylmethacrylate) is percutaneously injected into the vertebral body. Systematic reviews of both procedures have shown significantly improved back pain and quality of life compared to conservative therapy. Direct comparison between VP and KP is not possible because of the lack of prospective randomized data comparing the two procedures. Both appear to improve patient functional status in most studies, although it is difficult to pool the available data because of differing measurement scales. With increasing popularity of both techniques, particularly over the past ten years, a rising number of publications have detailed potential complications secondary to cement extravasation, from compression of neural elements to venous embolism. Overall complication rates for both procedures are low. Systematic reviews have found significantly higher rates of cement leakage after VP (40%) versus KP (8%), with 3% of VP leaks being symptomatic. The evidence for increased risk of adjacent level fracture after these procedures compared to conservative treatment is inconclusive. When performed by a well-trained practitioner in appropriately selected patients, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are both safe and effective treatments for fresh vertebral compression fractures. Results from ongoing randomized controlled trials will provide further detailed information about both procedures in the future.",eng,0.0

In the past decade, minimally invasive bone augmentation techniques for VF, such as percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) have become more widespread. According to the literature, both techniques provide significant pain relief. However, KP is more expensive and technically more demanding than VP. The current study surveyed German surgeons who practice percutaneous augmentation to evaluate and compare decisions regarding the implementation of these techniques. Is there a difference in the indications and contraindications of VP and KP compared with the interdisciplinary consensus paper on VP and KP of the German medical association in the treatment of VF? METHODS: A multiple choice questionnaire was designed with questions regarding diagnostic procedures, clinical and radiologic (AO classification) indications, as well as contraindications for both VP and KP. A panel of five experts refined the initial questionnaire. The final version was then sent to 580 clinics registered to practice KP in Germany. The statistical analysis was done by two authors, who collected the questionnaire data and Wilcoxon's signed ranks test was performed for non-parametric variables with SPSS. RESULTS: 327 of 580 questionnaires (56.4%) were completed and returned. 151 (46.2%) of participants were performing both procedures, and 176 (53.8%) performed KP only. Median duration from onset of acute pain to intervention was 3 weeks. For most participants (95.4%), consistent back pain at the fracture level with a visual analog scale score over 5 was the main clinical indication for VP and KP. A1 and A3.1 fractures from osteoporosis and metastasis were considered indications for KP. Osteoporotic A1.1 fractures were an indication for VP. Traumatic A3.2 fractures were not an indication for either procedure. Major contraindications to both procedures were active infection (94.7%), cement allergy (86.8%), and coagulation disorders (80.3%). CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty both have roles in the treatment of vertebral fractures. However, we could see differences in the indications for the two percutaneous techniques. Participants of this study found more indications for KP versus VP in cases of painful A1.2 and A3.1 fractures due to osteoporosis, metastasis, and trauma. About half of the respondents reported that VP is indicated for osteoporotic and pathologic A1.1 fractures. This study offers only limited conclusions. Open questionnaires and prospective data from all clinicians performing these procedures should be analyzed to offer more specific information.",eng,0.0

METHODS: In a prospective study from December 2010 to October 2011, 25 patients underwent RF kyphoplasty for 30 fresh osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The parameter demographics, pain relief, restoration of vertebral body height (mean vertebral body height, kyphosis angle, anterior/posterior edge height) and all complications were recorded. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 73.8 +/- 9.6 (range, 55-83); time from initial painful fracture to treatment was 3.0 weeks +/- 1.2; average operative time was 23.5 min (range, 15-41). Average pain index score decreased significantly from 69 +/- 8.5 preoperatively to 34.4 +/- 5.9 postoperatively (p < 0.001), and to 30 +/- 6.3 (p < 0.001) after 3 months. Mean vertebral body height, anterior edge height and kyphosis angle showed significant increases postoperatively and at 3-month follow-up (p < 0.05). In two vertebrae (6.6 %), minimal, asymptomatic cement leakage occurred in the upper disc. After 2 months, one new fracture (3.3 %) was identified in the directly adjacent segment that was also successfully treated with radiofrequency kyphoplasty. There was a preliminary correlation between mean vertebral body height elevation and cement volume (r = 0.533).

Although this rare complication has been reported, the current literature does not address the need for awareness of symptoms of potentially devastating respiratory compromise.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 29-year-old man who underwent T11 vertebroplasty and subsequently had chest pain develop several days later. His right lower lung lobe had infarcted owing to massive cement embolization to his pulmonary arterial circulation. Open pulmonary wedge resection and embolectomy were performed. The patient recovered from the embolectomy but had chronic, persistent respiratory symptoms after surgery.
LITERATURE REVIEW: Operative management of vertebral compression fractures has included percutaneous vertebroplasty for the past 25 years. The reported incidence of pulmonary cement emboli after vertebroplasty ranges from 2.1% to 26% with much of this variation resulting from which radiographic technique is used to detect embolization. Symptoms of pulmonary cement embolism can occur during the procedure, but more commonly begin days to weeks, even months, after vertebroplasty. At least six deaths from cement embolization after vertebroplasty have been reported. Most cases of pulmonary cement emboli with cardiovascular and pulmonary complications are treated nonoperatively with anticoagulation. Endovascular removal of large cement emboli from the pulmonary arteries is not without risk and sometimes requires open surgery for complete removal of cement pieces.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Pulmonary cement embolism is a potentially serious complication of vertebroplasty. If a patient has chest pain or respiratory difficulty after the procedure, chest radiography and possibly advanced chest imaging studies should be performed immediately.",English,0.0

Possible procedural disadvantages, however, include incomplete fracture reduction or a significant loss of reduction after balloon tamp deflation, prior to cement injection. A new procedure called vertebral body stenting"" (VBS) was tested in vitro and compared to kyphoplasty. VBS uses a specially designed catheter-mounted stent which can be implanted and expanded inside the vertebral body. As much as 24 fresh frozen human cadaveric vertebral bodies (T11-L5) were utilized. After creating typical compression fractures, the vertebral bodies were reduced by kyphoplasty (n = 12) or by VBS (n = 12) and then stabilized with PMMA bone cement. Each step of the procedure was performed under fluoroscopic control and analysed quantitatively. Finally, static and dynamic biomechanical tests were performed. A complete initial reduction of the fractured vertebral body height was achieved by both systems. There was a significant loss of reduction after balloon deflation in kyphoplasty compared to VBS, and a significant total height gain by VBS (mean +/- SD in %, p < 0.05, demonstrated by: anterior height loss after deflation in relation to preoperative height [kyphoplasty: 11.7 +/- 6.2; VBS: 3.7 +/- 3.8], and total anterior height gain [kyphoplasty: 8.0 +/- 9.4; VBS: 13.3 +/- 7.6]). Biomechanical tests showed no significant stiffness and failure load differences between systems. VBS is an innovative technique which allows for the possibly complete reduction of vertebral compression fractures and helps maintain the restored height by means of a stent. The height loss after balloon deflation is significantly decreased by using VBS compared to kyphoplasty, thus offering a new promising option for vertebral augmentation.""",eng,0.0

Using the combination of a permanent implant plus cement, it is now conceivable that the amount of cement can be reduced and so this augmentation could be an attractive opportunity for use in traumatic fractures in young and middle-aged patients. The objective of this study was to determine the smallest volume of cement necessary to stabilize fractured vertebrae comparing the SpineJack system to the gold standard, balloon kyphoplasty. METHODS: 36 fresh frozen human cadaveric vertebral bodies (T11-L3) were utilized. After creating typical compression wedge fractures (AO A1.2.1), the vertebral bodies were reduced by SpineJack (n=18) or kyphoplasty (n=18) under preload (100N). Subsequently, different amounts of bone cement (10%, 16% or 30% of the vertebral body volume) were inserted. Finally, static and dynamic biomechanical tests were performed. FINDINGS: Following augmentation and fatigue tests, vertebrae treated with SpineJack did not show any significant loss of intraoperative height gain, in contrast to kyphoplasty. In the 10% and 16%-group the height restoration expressed as a percentage of the initial height was significantly increased with the SpineJack (>300%). Intraoperative SpineJack could preserve the maximum height gain (mean 1% height loss) better than kyphoplasty (mean 16% height loss). INTERPRETATION: In traumatic wedge fractures it is possible to reduce the amount of cement to 10% of the vertebral body volume when SpineJack is used without compromising the reposition height after reduction, in contrast to kyphoplasty that needs a 30% cement volume.",eng,0.0

Thomsen,2009.0,[Percutaneous vertebroplasty with only few complications--a retrospective study],", ","INTRODUCTION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was introduced in 1984 and has proved to be valuable in the treatment of painful vertebral lesions such as haemangiomas, metastasis, and osteoporotic fractures. According to the literature, the operation provides pain relief with only few and harmless complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate our perioperative experiences with special reference to the safety of the procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 156 procedures were performed in 148 patients with osteoporotic fractures. Both acute and chronic fractures were treated. All patients had plain radiographs of the spine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or bone scans were performed in case of old fractures or more than one fracture in patients with acute back-pain. At follow-up after three and 12 months, plain radiographs were performed in conjunction with physical examinations and interviews. Data were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: We identified 40.4% cemental leaks (confidence interval (CI) 32.6; 48.5). None of these resulted in neurological symptoms. One patient experienced shortness of breath after the procedure, one had atrial fibrillation, and one patient had an iatrogenic pneumothorax. In all, the frequency of symptomatic complications was 1.9% (CI -0.4; 5.5). CONCLUSION: We believe that PVP is a safe procedure with only few symptomatic complications when performed under local anaesthesia and by a specialist in transpedicular approach.",dan,0.0

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) to conservative treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures in a clinical randomized study with respect to pain, physical and mental outcome, and to asses the risk of adjacent fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PVP is a therapeutic procedure performed to reduce pain in vertebral lesions. Despite the lack of comparative randomized clinical trials PVP is generally seen as a safe and efficient procedure for painful osteoporotic fractures. METHODS: Fifty patients (41 females) were included from January 2001 until January 2008. Patients with acute (<2 weeks) and subacute (between 2 and 8 weeks) osteoporotic fractures were included and randomized to either PVP or conservative treatment. Pain was assessed with a visual analogue scale and physical and mental outcome were assessed by validated questionnaires and tests. Tests, questionnaires, and plain radiographs were performed at the inclusion and after 3 months. RESULTS: Reduction in pain from initial visit to 3-month follow-up was comparable in the 2 groups (P = 0.33) from approximate visual analogue scale 8.0 to visual analogue scale 2.0, intragroup difference was significant (P = 0.00). Reduction in pain in the PVP group was immediate 12 to 24 hours after the procedure (P = 0.00). There was no significant difference in the other parameters when comparing the results at inclusion and after 3 months within both groups and between the groups after 3 months with a few exceptions. We observed 2 adjacent fractures in the PVP group and non in the conservative group. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients with acute or subacute painful osteoporotic compression fractures in the spine will recover after a few months of conservative treatment. The risk of adjacent fractures needs further research. No major adverse events were observed.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is compared to conservative treatment in patients with acute or subacute osteoporotic vertebral fractures with respect to pain, physical and mental outcomes. The risk of vertebral fractures adjacent to treated levels is assessed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are some disagreements of the benefits of PVP for the treatment of acute osteoporotic vertebral fractures, but the long-term clinical outcome of PVP compared to conservative treatment has not been evaluated in a randomized study. METHODS: The 3-months follow-up of this study has been published previously, and here we report the completed 12-months analysis. About 50 patients (41 females) were included from January 2001 until January 2008. Patients with vertebral fractures less than 8 weeks old were included and randomized to either PVP or conservative treatment. Pain was assessed with a visual analogue scale. Physical and mental outcomes were assessed by validated questionnaires and tests. Tests, questionnaires, and plain radiographs were performed at the inclusion and after 3 and 12 months. RESULTS: Pain score before and after the operation in the PVP group was 7.9 and 2.0, respectively. There was no difference between the groups concerning pain at the 3- and 12-months follow-up. Supplementary assessment of back pain 1 month after discharge from hospital showed a significant lower VAS score in the PVP group over the conservative group. In the study period, 2 adjacent fractures in the PVP group and no adjacent fractures in the conservative group were registered. CONCLUSION: PVP is a good treatment for some patients with acute/subacute painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures, but the majority of fractures will heal after 8 to 12 weeks of conservative treatment with subsequent decline in pain.

METHODS: From October 2008 to October 2012,178 patients with 224 osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were treated with percutaneous kyphoplasty under local anethsia. There were 72 males and 106 females,ranging in age from 58 to 92 years old,with an average of 75.3 years,including 93 thoracic vertebrae and 131 lumbar vertebrae. The complications except bone cement leakage were analyzed during operation and after operation. RESULTS: All operations were successful and all patients were followed up from 12 to 60 months with an average of 26.2 months. No death was found. Bone cement leakage occurred in 27 cases, about 15.1% in 178 cases; and complications except bone cement leakage occurred in 15 cases. There was 1 case with cardiac arrest,was completely recovery by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately; and 1 case with temporary absence of breathing,was recovery after treatment. There were 3 cases with fall of blood pressure and slower of heart rate; 1 case with intestinal obstruction; 2 cases with local hematoma and 1 case with intercostal neuralgia.

Schmoelz,2009.0,Vertebroplasty with high-viscosity polymethylmethacrylate cement facilitates vertebral body restoration in vitro,10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181b61d10,"STUDY DESIGN: In vitro biomechanical study on 6 fresh frozen human thoracolumbar spine specimens. OBJECTIVE: Using a novel high viscosity polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement and vertebroplasty kit to correct the kyphosis angle of wedge compression fractures (AO/ASIF 1.2). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is typically used to stabilize vertebral compression fractures in situ without correcting kyphosis, with the main target to reduce pain and disability. The vertebroplasty system investigated in this study comprises a high viscosity PMMA cement and uses a hydrostatic pressure hand piece for enhanced cement allocation and flow control. A recent clinical trial demonstrated a significantly reduced incidence of cement leakage with this system. METHODS: Six spinal segments (Th11-L1 and Th12-L2) were loaded in a spine tester with pure moments of 7.5 Nm in lateral bending, flexion/extension and axial rotation. The segmental range of motion (ROM) was continuously recorded. The tested states of the specimens were: intact (a), fractured (b), treated with vertebroplasty (c), after loading with 50 to 250 N (d), 50 to 450 N (e) and 50 to 650 N (f) of 1000 cycles each. In each state (a-f), the kyphosis angle was documented fluoroscopically. RESULTS: Kyphosis angle was significantly reduced between intact and fractured states (P<0.02). Between treated and fractured states, we found highly significant difference (P<0.001), indicating full correction. During 3000 loading cycles (50-250, 50-450, and 50-650 N), the kyphosis angle remained constant compared to the treated state (P=1.0). We noted a logistic relationship between injected cement volume and extent of kyphosis correction (R=0.89, P<0.001). In the fractured state, the ROM in flexion/extension increased to 252% of the intact state (P<0.001). The vertebroplasty treatment decreased ROM to 72% of fractured state in flexion/extension (P<0.001). Macroscopic inspection of the vertebrae after testing showed an intact interface and tight mechanical interlocking of cement filling and trabecular bone. CONCLUSION: High viscosity vertebroplasty effectively reduced and stabilized thoracolumbar wedge compression fractures and may represent a one-step solution for restoring vertebral body dimensions following thoracolumbar compression fractures, while minimizing the risk of cement leakage and associated complications in vivo.",eng,0.0

Percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty are minimally invasive methods based on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement application into the damaged vertebra. This leads to decrease of the pain and vertebral body stabilisation. Oncology disorders of the spine are relatively common, having a wide alternative of various methods of treatment. Patients, according to their findings and indication criteria, are treated surgically or conservatively, oncological treatment is usually based on radiotherapy. Authors discuss the role of these invasive procedures in the treating algorithm of patients with spinal metasthases and multiple myeloma. METHODS AND RESULTS: From September 2003 to December 2005, 21 percutaneous vertebroplasties in 14 patients, mean age 68.7 (47-80) year, were performed in our department. During one treatment session 1-2 vertebrae (total of 21 vertebrae) in level Th9 - L5 were treated. Vertebroplasties and kyphoplasty were performed under fluoroscopy guidance. Transpedicular acces was used. Totally, 3 asymptomatic complications were proved. As first, a bone cement leaked paravertebrally during L5 body treatment, as second, a bone cement leaked into paravertebral veins, and as third, a bone cement leaked into the intervertebral space. Visual analog scale (VAS) was 8.9 points before procedure, 1.9 point 3 months after procedure and 2.6 points 6 months after procedure. We did not prove a symptomatic or total complication.

We retrospectively reviewed 99 consecutive patients who had undergone percutaneous vertebroplasty for VCFs. A cleft was defined as a signal void or hyperintense area on non-enhanced MRI (T(1) and T(2) weighted imaging) or as a hypointense area within a diffusely enhanced vertebra on CEMRI. A cleft was confirmed as a solid opacification on post-procedural radiographs. The interobserver reliability and MRI diagnostic performance were evaluated. The interobserver reliability of non-enhanced MRI was substantial (k _ 0.698) and the interobserver reliability of CEMRI was almost perfect (k _ 0.836). Post-procedural radiographs showed solid cleft opacification in 32 out of the 99 cases. The sensitivity and specificity of non-enhanced MRI were 0.72 and 0.82 (observer 1) and 0.63 and 0.87 (observer 2), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CEMRI were 0.94 and 0.63 (observer 1) and 0.85 and 0.60 (observer 2), respectively. The sensitivity of CEMRI was significantly higher than that of non-enhanced MRI, and the specificity of non-enhanced MRI was higher than that of CEMRI. CEMRI was highly reliable and sensitive, and non-enhanced MRI was specific for intravertebral clefts. Therefore, spine MRIs, including CEMRI, could provide useful information about intravertebral clefts before percutaneous vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

METHODS: The authors assessed the clinical outcome under the criteria such as the pain improvement, activity, requirement of analgesics, and the patient's satisfaction, and determined the relation to various peri- and intra-operative factors, and postoperative imaging findings. RESULTS: The outcome was determined as 84.2% in relief of pain, 72.0% in change in activity, 65.7% in analgesics use, and 84.7% of satisfaction rate. More severe focal back pain, high uptake bone scan, and the lower mean T-score were related to the better pain relief following PVP. The longer the duration between fracture and PVP, the less severe focal back pain, low uptake bone scan, and leakage of PMMA into the paravertebral space were related to the less improvement in activity. Female and low uptake bone scan showed a correlation with more analgesic use. The longer the duration between fracture and PVP, low uptake bone scan, and the higher the mean T-score were correlated with the less the patients satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that PVP may be more effective in the acute phase of VCFs, more severe focal pain, and far advanced osteoporosis on BMD.

A retrospective study was performed to assess what caused PMMA cement to leak into the epidural space and to determine if this leakage caused any changes in its therapeutic benefits. METHODS: Polymethylmethacrylate was injected into 347 vertebral compression fractures in 159 patients. The cement leaked into the epidural space in 92 (26.5%) of 347 treated vertebrae in 64 (40.3%) of the 159 patients, as demonstrated on postoperative computerized tomography scanning. Epidural leakage of PMMA cement occurred more often when injected above the level of T-7 (p = 0.001) than below. The larger the volume of PMMA injected the higher the incidence of epidural leakage (p = 0.03). Using an injector also increased epidural leakage (p = 0.045). The position of the needle tip within the vertebral body and the pattern of venous drainage did not affect epidural leakage of the cement. Leakage of PMMA into the epidural space reduced the pain relief expected after vertebroplasty. The immediate postoperative visual analog scale scores were higher (and therefore reflective of less pain relief) in patients in whom epidural PMMA leakage occurred (p = 0.009). Three months postoperatively, the authors found the highest number of patients presenting with pain relief, including those in the group with epidural leakage, and at this follow-up stage there were no significant differences between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that epidural leakage of PMMA after percutaneous vertebroplasty was dose dependent. The larger amount of injected PMMA, the higher the incidence of leakage. Injecting vertebral levels above T-7 also increased the incidence of epidural leakage. Epidural leakage of PMMA may attenuate only the immediate therapeutic effects of vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

Callos calcium phosphate cement (CPC) is one of them. A prospective nonrandomized controlled study was performed to assess the clinical and radiologic results after balloon kyphoplasty with Callos CPC in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. METHODS: Twenty-six patients were enrolled in this study. Clinical outcome was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The degree of vertebral height loss and changes in the kyphotic angle were measured using plain-film x-rays. Blood tests were carried in all cases out to observe the variation in postoperative serum calcium levels. RESULTS: The VAS and ODI scores decreased from 7.5 +/- 1.1 to 2.2 +/- 1.4 (P = .000) and from 31.7 +/- 1.6 to 16.9 +/- 1.7 (P = .000), respectively. Although vertebral height loss (M = 25.4% +/- 17.4%) was reduced after the operation (M=22.1% +/- 15.3%, P = .002), recurrent progression of height loss was observed during the follow-up (M = 32.7% +/- 19.6%, P = .001). The kyphotic angle (M = 8.1 degrees +/- 4.8 degrees ) did not significantly change postoperatively (M = 8.7 degrees +/- 5.5 degrees , P = .350), and the serum calcium level was within normal ranges. CPC leakage to the spinal canal was observed in 15 cases (48.4%), and none of them presented any related clinical symptoms except one patient, who had transient intercostal neuralgia.

In this report, we highlight intradural cement leakage which is a rare complication of the procedure. A 49 year old man with a T12 compression fracture due to multiple myeloma was referred to the neurosurgery department from the orthopaedics and traumatology clinic after developing a right lower limb weakness following percutaneous vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate. An urgent thoraco-lumbar magnetic resonance imaging was performed. The T1 and T2-weighted images demonstrated intradural extramedullary and epidural cement leakages which were hypointense on both sequences. Total laminectomy was performed at T12 and L1 and two epidural cement collections were excised on the right. Then, a dural incision from T12 to the body of L1 was done and cement material seen in front of the rootlets excised without any nerve injury. The patient was discharged after a week and referred to the haematology clinic for additional therapy of multiple myeloma. Although the cement leakage was extensive, the right leg weakness improved significantly and he began to walk with assistance 3 months later.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of stand-alone acrylic kyphoplasty in the treatment of recent traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine in young patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The management of fractures of the thoracolumbar spine without neurological deficit remains controversial. For a long time clinicians could only chose between functional treatment, orthopedic treatment, and traditional surgery. The recent advent of minimally invasive surgical techniques is an interesting alternative. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 45.8+/-18.2 years and who had recently sustained a fracture of the thoracolumbar junction were enrolled into the study. Balloon kyphoplasty was performed using acrylic cement. Radiologic assessments (computed tomography scans) and clinical assessments (including Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores) were used to determine kyphoplasty success and measure patient recovery over 2 years. RESULTS: Kyphoplasty reduced mean vertebral kyphosis from 12.8+/-5.0 degrees at trauma to 8.2+/-5.1 degrees at 2-year follow-up. Mean vertebral kyphosis was corrected by -5.7+/-4.7 degrees (P=0.0001) at the point of first verticalization, with no significant change at the 2-year follow-up visit (+1.1+/-4.3 degrees, P=0.1058). Kyphoplasty significantly augmented the height of the 6 anterior and intermediate segments. Maximum mean augmentation of intermediate vertebral height after 6 months was (11.6%+/-15.5%, P<0.0001). Patients tolerated the procedure well and 56% of them returned to work 3 months after kyphoplasty. CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty is safe and effective in the correction of nonosteoporotic fractures of the thoracolumbar junction in young patients, and remains stable for at least 2 years postsurgery.",eng,0.0

The mean age of the patients was 71.9 +/- 5.2 years and the affected vertebrae were located in the thoracolumbar junction. The mean period between the onset of motor weakness and the day of the surgery was 9.5 +/- 5.7 weeks. Vertebroplasty was performed by filling the intravertebral cleft with polymethylmethacrylate. The clinical course was estimated using the Denis pain scale, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status scale and the modified Medical Research Council grade before the surgery, 0, 1, 3, 6 months and 1 year following the surgery, and at the latest follow-up visit. The instability angle and local kyphotic angle were evaluated with X-rays. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in the pain scale in all patients, as they did not experience severe pain, and the performance status following the surgery. These conditions continued until the final clinical examination. Most patients had motor weakness, with a preoperative manual motor test score of 0-3, which gradually improved to 4-5 over the examination period. The stabilities of the affected vertebrae were confirmed on imaging at the final examination. Kyphotic changes were initially realigned, but a correction loss occurred in 7 of the 11 patients as a result of adjacent vertebral fractures. Increase in kyphosis following the surgery did not affect the muscle strength recovery. Bridging callus formations were observed around the affected vertebrae within 6 months in all cases. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty for vertebral pseudarthrosis with delayed-onset paraplegia is effective for recovering muscle strength, improving performance status and relief from pain, despite local kyphosis.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 73 vertebral bodies that had undergone percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) by the ISOP method, 118 vertebral bodies that had undergone the puncture simulation method, and 33 vertebral bodies that had undergone the conventional method. The items to be examined included the success rate (SR) of the median puncture of the vertebral body and the procedure time. The puncture accuracy and fluoroscopy time were also measured for the ISOP method. RESULTS: The SR was significantly higher and the procedure time significantly shorter when using the ISOP method rather than the conventional method. However, no significant differences were observed between the ISOP method and the puncture simulation method. The errors between the puncture needle tip and the puncture target point in the ISOP method were an average of 1.52, 2.08, and 1.87 mm in each of the horizontal, ventrodorsal, and craniocaudal directions. The fluoroscopy time when operating on one vertebral body was an average of 5.8 min. CONCLUSION: The ISOP method is considered to be a useful approach while also reducing the puncture time and the fluoroscopy time.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the local ethics committee; informed consent was obtained from all patients. This retrospective review was performed for 51 consecutive patients with metastatic disease or multiple myeloma treated by means of vertebroplasty, who presented with at least one vertebral lesion with epidural involvement, with or without clinical symptoms of spinal cord or cauda equina compression. All patients with neurologic deficit were terminally ill. A neurologic examination was performed before and after treatment in all patients. All imaging examinations and treatments were reviewed, and chi(2), Mann Whitney, or Fisher exact testing was performed for univariate analysis of variables. RESULTS: A total of 74 vertebrae were treated in 51 patients, 22 women and 29 men with a mean age of 62.5 years (range, 28-85 years). Fifteen (29%) patients presented symptoms of complete or incomplete spinal cord or cauda equina compression before vertebroplasty and no further clinical deterioration was observed after treatment. The analgesic efficacy of vertebroplasty was satisfactory for 94% (48 of 51) of patients after 1 day, 86% (31 of 36) patients after 1 month, and 92% (11 of 12) patients after 1 year. One patient with no clinical neurologic deficit before treatment experienced symptoms of cauda equina compression 2 days after vertebroplasty. No other major complication was observed. CONCLUSION: The feasibility, efficacy, and safety of PV were confirmed in patients experiencing pain related to malignant spinal tumors with epidural extension, with a low complication rate. PV should become part of the palliative analgesic treatment for such patients. (c) RSNA, 2010.",eng,1.0

Fifty-one patients were treated by BKP at 75 spinal levels, and 137 vertebroplasties were performed as well. RESULTS: Several recurrent complications or procedural failures were observed during BKP: cortical or endplate fracture by balloon expansion (4 vertebrae), partial vertebral re-collapse after deflation (4 vertebrae), balloon rupture during inflation (5 vertebrae), and transient hyperalgia after the procedure (11 patients, 27.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Several symptomatic or asymptomatic complications and technical failures can occur during BKP.

In Hill-Sachs lesions, reconstruction techniques vary widely and range from open reduction to tendon transposition or humeral head derotation. These operations are extensive and have questionable outcomes. With the expertise from vertebral compression fracture reduction by kyphoplasty, we examined in a cadaver feasibility study whether reduction of the Hill-Sachs lesion via hydraulic lift might be an anatomical and minimally invasive treatment option. We postulated that the use a of a balloon- assisted kyphoplasty reduction could achieve almost anatomical correction of the defect. METHODS: We created Hill-Sachs lesions in six humeral specimens and performed a computed tomography (CT) scan before and after reduction with the kyphoplasty system. The entry point at the greater tuberosity and balloon positioning was visualised by fluoroscopy. The size of the Hill-Sachs lesion before and after reduction was measured using CT scans in the axial orientation. RESULTS: Using the balloon kyphoplasty system, we achieved a statistically significant reduction (80 % ) of the Hill-Sachs lesion. CONCLUSION: In a preliminary cadaver study we show that using a balloon kyphoplasty system might be an alternative treatment option for Hill-Sachs lesions, with reduced collateral damage that can occur with other minimally invasive techniques. Future work is needed to evaluate the technique under arthroscopic conditions.",eng,1.0

A comparative study,10.1016/j.ejrad.2010.01.010,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty to treat pain from non-neoplastic vertebral fractures and improve functional outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared 30 patients treated by vertebroplasty for non-neoplastic vertebral fractures with 30 patients treated by kyphoplasty for the same condition. Pain was measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and functional outcome with the Oswestry disability index (ODI). Baseline data were compared with measurements on the day after the procedure (for pain alone) and at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. RESULTS: The VAS pain score was reduced by 4-5 points on the day after either type of treatment, a statistically significant improvement. The global ODI was significantly improved (by 13-18 points) at 1 month after either procedure. These improvements persisted at 6 months and 1 year. No significant differences in functional outcome were observed between the techniques. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty obtain similar improvements in pain and functional outcomes in these patients. The choice of technique must therefore depend on other factors. An initial improvement with either technique is a good predictor of long-term improvement.",eng,0.0

Kotwica,2014.0,Treatment of multiple osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures by percutaneous cement augmentation,10.1007/s00264-014-2470-3,"PURPOSE: Vertebral compression fractures cause significant pain and some patients are debilitated by the pain due to the fracture. Conventional surgery carries a high risk and has a poor outcome. Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure, which in vertebral fractures restores stability and diminishes pain. The aim of the study was to analyse the effectiveness and safety of vertebroplasty in multiple vertebral compression fractures with a 24-month follow-up. METHODS: Vertebroplasty was performed in 160 patients with multiple osteoporotic compression fractures under local anaesthesia, using a unilateral transpedicular approach. The level of pain was assessed according to a 10-cm visual analogue scale. The patients were observed for 24 months after surgery. RESULTS: Vertebroplasty significantly diminished the level of pain in 90% of patients, and half of them were free of pain within 12 hours after surgery. Only 4% of the patients did not benefit from this type of treatment. During the 24-month follow-up these results changed only slightly, and after two years almost 80% still benefited, while the number of unsatisfactory results changed from 6 to 9%. No serious clinical complications were noted; in three patients new fractures appeared during the two year observation period.

PVP is minimally invasive, but the complications are not rare; however, they are in most cases not significant clinically. The most frequent is cement leakage, which can occur onto veins, paravertebral soft tissue, into the intervertebral disk, or to the spinal canal, affecting foraminal area or epidural space. We analyzed results of treatment and complications of vertebroplasty performed with the use of polimethylomethylacrylate cement (PMMA) on 1100 vertebrae, with a special regard to the severity of complication and eventual clinical manifestation. One thousand one hundred PVP were analyzed, performed in 616 patients. There were 468 (76%) women and 148 men (24%), 24 to 94-year old, mean age 68 years. From 1100 procedures, 794 treated osteporotic and 137 fractures due to malignant disease, 69 PVP were made in traumatic fractures. One hundred patients had painful vertebral hemangiomas. Seven hundred twenty-six (66%) lesions were in thoracic, and 374 (34%) in lumbar area. Results of treatment were assessed using 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 12 hours after surgery, 7 days, 30 days, and then each 6 months, up to 3 years. Before surgery all patients had significant pain 7 to 10 in VAS scale, mean 8.9 cm. Twelve hours after surgery 602 (97.7%) reported significant relief of pain, with mean VAS of 2,3 cm. Local complications occurred in 50% of osteoporotic, 34% of neoplastic, 16% of traumatic fractures, and 2% of vertebral hemangiomas. The most common was PMMA leakage into surrounding tissues-20%; paravertebral vein embolism-13%; intradiscal leakage-8%; and PMMA leakage into the spinal canal-0.8%. Results of treatment did not differ between patients with and without any complications. From 104 patients who had chest X-ray or CT study performed after surgery, pulmonary embolism was noted in 2 patients, but without any clinical symptoms. Only 1 patient-with PMMA leakage into the spinal canal required surgical decompression In conclusion, PVP is effective in decreasing the level of pain in compression vertebral fractures. Complications occur in almost half of the patients but in more than 95% of them do not produce any clinical symptoms.",eng,1.0

Ten of the patients complained of persistent radiculopathy. The cause of radiculopathy was initially diagnosed as lumbar canal stenosis (LCS) in seven patients, lumbar foraminal stenosis (LFS) in two, and both in one. One patient with LFS had reduced pain with conservative treatment, and the other nine needed surgical treatments. LCS was treated with posterior decompression, and LFS complicated with LCS at the same spinal level was treated with posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF). Vertebroplasty was performed for one patient with LFS to attain indirect nerve root decompression achieved as a result of vertebral reconstruction and stabilization. Four of the patients treated with posterior decompression for LCS suffered from residual radiculopathy postoperatively, which was caused by LFS at the same level or the level below the treated level. Two patients underwent second operative procedure (PLIF) for recurrent radiculopathy. The Japanese Orthopedic Association and Visual Analogue Scale scores of the pain improved after operations, but the scores of the patients treated without spinal fusion gradually worsened during the follow-up period, whereas the scores of the patients treated with PLIF remained stable at various levels. Seven of the ten patients developed LFS following OVF, suggesting that radiculopathy following OVF involves LFS with high frequency.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 243 consecutive vertebral augmentation procedures over a 17-month period. Curved needle procedures were compared with noncurved needle procedures for baseline clinical variables, complication rate, pain relief, and improvement in disability. Procedure duration and fluoroscopy time were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Between curved needle and noncurved needle procedures, there were no statistically significant differences in the baseline clinical variables, fracture location, and fracture etiology. No complications were noted in either group. In both groups, there was a median improvement in the visual analog scale (VAS) score of 2.0 points (P = .62). More than 90% of procedures in both groups resulted in some pain improvement (P = .78). For both groups, the median improvement in disability on the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) was 4.0 points (P = .69). Approximately 70% of procedures in both groups resulted in improvement in disability (P = 1.00). In single-level cases, there were shorter procedure times (51.8 min +/- 2.7 vs 62.8 min +/- 2.2, P = .002) and shorter fluoroscopy times (P = .31) for curved needle procedures.

During the summer of 2009, the INVEST trial was one of 2 randomized controlled studies that reported equivalence between vertebroplasty and a control procedure. OBJECTIVE: In this analysis, we sought to compare the subset of patients studied in the INVEST trial to a tertiary academic institution with respect to 2 variables: Workers compensation status and presence of advanced imaging prior to the procedure. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of 634 procedures. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 634 vertebral augmentation procedures at our institution between June 2004 and August 2008, overlapping with the dataset of the INVEST trial. The primary comparison was whether patients received Workers compensation and/or advanced imaging prior to the procedure. The study was IRB approved, and in accordance with HIPAA guidelines. RESULTS: There were 409 patients who underwent 634 procedures between June 2004 and August 2008. Among 634 procedures, only 3 included Workers compensation. Therefore, the majority of patients (> 99%) did not receive Workers compensation compared to the INVEST trial (11 - 13%). Similarly, in 629 out of 634 procedures (99.2%), patients underwent advanced imaging comprised of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) or bone scan. LIMITATIONS: We simply looked at 2 elements of the patient demographic in a time-matched fashion and compared it to the U.S. based INVEST trial. It is possible that despite our diligent efforts to review the data set, we have inadvertently excluded some patients, the incorporation of whom might have changed the statistics.

Vertebroplasty had been traditional treatment for pain, but it neither attempts to restore vertebral body height nor eliminates spinal deformity and is associated with a high rate of cement leakage. Balloon kyphoplasty involves introduction of inflatable balloon into the fractured body of vertebra for elevation of the end-plates prior to fixation of the fracture with bone cement. This study evaluates short term functional and radiological outcomes of balloon kyphoplasty. The secondary aim is to explore short-term complications of the procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 199 kyphoplasty procedures in 135 patients from March 2009 to March 2012 were evaluated with short form-36 (SF-36) score, visual analogue scale (VAS), detailed neurological and radiological evaluations. The mean followup was 18 months (range 12-20 months). Statistical analysis including paired sample t-test was done with statistical package for social sciences. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in SF-36 (from 34.29 to 48.53, an improvement of 14.24, standard deviation (SD) - 20.08 P < 0.0001), VAS (drop of 4.49, from 6.74 to 2.24, SD - 1.44, P < 0.0001), percentage restoration of lost vertebral height (from 30.62% to 16.19%, improvement of 14.43%, SD - 15.37, P < 0.0001) and kyphotic angle correction (from 17.41 degrees to 10.59 degrees , improvement of 6.82, SD - 7.26 degrees , P < 0.0001) were noted postoperatively. Six patients had cement embolism, 65 had cement leak and three had adjacent level fracture which required repeat kyphoplasty later. One patient with history of ischemic heart disease had cardiac arrest during the procedure. No patients had neurological deterioration in the followup period.

In our center, we switched from using a C-arm to an O-arm image guidance system to perform balloon kyphoplasty. Our preliminary experience is reported in Acta Neurochirurgica, and the encouraging results led us to study this subject more extensively. This article presents our complete results. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comparable clinical series describing O-arm use in kyphoplasty procedures published in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To report our complete results of using the O-arm guidance system to perform balloon kyphoplasty.

RESULTS: The mean surgical time for the procedure was 38 minutes with a mean fluoroscopy procedure time of 3.1 minutes. The mean fluoroscopy time by level was 2.5 minutes. Mean irradiation dose by procedure was 220 mGy and by level was 166 mGy. There was a significant reduction in fluoroscopy time and x-ray exposure from 5.1 minutes with classic C-arm use to 3.1 minutes when with O-arm use without additional time required for positioning the system.

In our center, we recently moved from this way of proceeding to the use of an O-Arm image guidance system to perform cement augmentation in vertebral fractures. To our knowledge, there is no clinical series describing the O-arm use in a balloon kyphoplasty procedure published in the scientific literature. We prospectively evaluate on 16 consecutive patients, the feasibility of the O-Arm guided kyphoplasty procedure with the original, usual tools, and we measured the fluoroscopy time and the X-ray exposure. We didn't experience any device related problem and demonstrated a significant reduction of X-ray exposure and time of fluoroscopy. We believe that using this new intraoperative system, the overall time of surgery and fluoroscopy could still be reduced in a near future.",eng,0.0

Struelens,2013.0,The surgeon's real dose exposure during balloon kyphoplasty procedure and evaluation of the cement delivery system: a prospective study,10.1007/s00586-013-2702-z,"PURPOSE: Balloon kyphoplasty is currently widely used for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). Procedure safety is directly linked to precise radiological imaging generated by various X-ray systems (C-arm, O-arm, angiography table, etc.). This minimally invasive spinal surgery is, by definition, associated with significant radiation exposure for both patient and surgeon. Real dose exposure received by the surgeon is usually difficult to precisely record. In our center, all Balloon Kyphoplasty Procedures (BKP) are now performed using an O-arm image guidance system to control cement augmentation in VCF. Our preliminary experience described reduced dose exposure compared to C-arm guided procedures. We present here an additional way to considerably reduce the amount of radiation received by the surgeon during BKP using a new injection system. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated O-arm guided BKP in 20 consecutive patients alternatively allocated to either classic O-arm BKP with direct bone filler injection or BKP using a new Cement Delivery System (CDS). Eye, wrist, finger and leg measurements were taken bilaterally and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The radiation dose received by the surgeon's finger, wrist and leg was reduced by greater than 80% when using the CDS. It allows the surgeon to work way below the most severe annual limit of dose exposure, which may not be the case when using a classical bone filler direct injection mechanism. CONCLUSION: We believe that when using this new intraoperative injection system, the surgeon's overall anatomic exposure is significantly reduced without compromising the critical procedure steps.",eng,0.0

Kyphoplasty as a minimally invasive procedure has been shown to be effective in stabilizing vertebral body fractures, resulting in immediate pain relief and improved physical function. The purpose of this prospective study was to clarify whether patients with acute traumatic vertebral fractures benefit more from kyphoplasty or from conservative treatment with a brace. A prospective study was undertaken in two centers. Forty patients with acute painful traumatic vertebral body fractures type A1-A3 (AO-classification) after adequate trauma, without osteoporosis, suitable for kyphoplasty or therapy by brace were included into the study. Follow-up was 12 months. Patients of the kyphoplasty group showed an immediate beneficial and significant effect postoperatively, and better outcomes 1 and 3 months after operation compared to the conservatively treated group in pain feeling, mobility and vertebral body height. After 12 months the difference between both groups was not significant excepting the vertebral body height. Kyphoplasty provides early and lasting reduction of pain and improvement of daily activity. However, there are clinically asymptomatic cement leakages in up to 45% of which we do not know the consequences in long term. Every patient with traumatic vertebral body fracture treated by kyphoplasty has to be informed about that. Long-time results are outstanding and our findings require confirmation by randomized controlled trials.",eng,0.0

We report a further case of spondylitis after vertebroplasty that was managed successfully with conservative therapy. METHODS: The clinical course of a 55-year-old patient with secondary osteoporosis due to liver cirrhosis from alcohol abuse is reported, in whom percutaneous vertebroplasty of three fractured vertebral bodies (L3-L5) was complicated by spondylitis at these levels. RESULTS: Spondylitis of L3-L5 with paravertebral abscess formation and progressive collapse of L5 was detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment consisted of percutaneous aspiration of the paravertebral abscess and antibiotic therapy. No bacteria was identified despite cultures have been taken before antibiotic treatment. The patient was treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin and consecutive clindamycin for a total of 3 months. One year after the infection the MRI signs of spondylitis have resolved without further collapse of L5. Painlevels have improved significantly, allowing the patient to return to work, but are still higher than immediately after vertebroplasty. CONCLUSION: Spondylitis is a rare complication of vertebroplasty. In the presented case a satisfactory result could be achieved through conservative antibiotic therapy and restriction of movement.",eng,1.0

Cement augmentation is widely performed and its complications and mechanical limitations are well described. Implants avoiding the side effects of cement augmentation while reaching the same level of stability would be desirable. The primary and secondary stability of a new augmentation method with self-locking hexagonal metal implants were investigated and compared with the performance of established augmentation options. 18 fresh-frozen human spinal specimens (Th12-L2/L3-L5) were tested with pure moments of 7.5 Nm in a six-degree-of-freedom spine simulator to investigate primary and secondary stability of three augmentation techniques: (1) vertebroplasty, (2) PMMA filled cavity and (3) hexagonal metal implants. An increasing three-step cyclic loading model was included. Elastic displacement and height loss under loading did not show significant differences between the three test groups. Investigation of primary and secondary stability evenly demonstrated comparable results for all techniques indicating an insufficiency to stabilise the fracture with higher load cycles.

Wenz,2011.0,Development of a novel method for intraoperative radiotherapy during kyphoplasty for spinal metastases (Kypho-IORT),10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.07.1985,"PURPOSE: Approximately 30% of patients with cancer receive bone metastases, of which 50% are in the spine. Approximately 20% present with unstable lesions requiring surgical intervention, followed by fractionated radiotherapy over 2-4 weeks to prevent early regrowth. Because of the limited survival time of patients with metastatic cancer, novel treatment concepts shortening the overall treatment time or hospitalization are desirable. In this study, we established a novel approach for intraoperative radiotherapy during kyphoplasty (Kypho-IORT), a method that combines stabilizing surgery and radiotherapy within one visit, after estimating the percentage of eligible patients for this treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To estimate the percentage of eligible patients, 53 planning CTs (897 vertebrae) of patients with spinal metastases were evaluated. The number of infiltrated vertebrae were counted and classified in groups eligible or not eligible for Kypho-IORT. The Kypho-IORT was performed in a donated body during a standard balloon kyphoplasty using the INTRABEAM system and specially designed applicators. A single dose of 10 Gy (in 10 mm) was delivered over 4 min to the vertebra. This was verified using two ionization chambers and a Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: The estimation of eligible patients resulted in 34% of the evaluated patients, and thus 34% of patients with instable spinal metastases are suitable for Kypho-IORT. This study shows also that, using the approach presented here, it is possible to perform an IORT during kyphoplasty with an additional 15 min operation time. The measurement in the donated body resulted in a maximum dose of 3.8 Gy in the spinal cord. However, the Monte Carlo depth dose simulation in bone tissue showed 68% less dose to the prescription depth. CONCLUSION: We present for the first time a system using an x-ray source that can be used for single-dose IORT during kyphoplasty. The described Kypho-IORT can decrease the overall treatment time for up to 34% of patients who usually receive radiotherapy for spinal metastases.",eng,0.0

Despite the prevalence of osteoporosis, there are a variety of aetiologies, such as lymphoma, myeloma or metastatic disease that may be responsible for the condition. In these instances, vertebral body biopsy can play an important role in determining fracture aetiology and assist in initiating concurrent medical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 80 vertebral body biopsies were performed in conjunction with percutaneous augmentation procedures on 50 patients at our teaching institution. Eleven biopsies were performed during vertebroplasty and 69 were performed during kyphoplasty. The mean age at the time of procedure was 75.7 years. Eight patients were male and 42 were female. A pathologist interpreted all biopsy samples and all charts were reviewed examining past history, diagnoses prior to compression fracture, biopsy results and post-op conditions that developed or were diagnosed after surgery. RESULTS: All patients healed their compression fractures following surgery and no complications were experienced. Eleven patients had a diagnosis of osteoporosis prior to vertebral fracture, while 8 patients had a malignant condition initially suspected as being responsible for the compression fracture. Malignancy was identified in 4 patients, 3 of whom did not previously have such a diagnosis. In an additional 6 cases the suspected aetiology behind vertebral compression fracture was not confirmed by pathology. DISCUSSION: This study found a 20% prevalence of malignancy in our population, which is higher than other reports in the literature. Eight percent of the patients in this study were ultimately found to have a malignant aetiology behind their compression fracture, while in 18% of the cases the presumed aetiology was not confirmed on pathological examination. Compression fractures can be one of the most common manifestations of osteoporosis, but a variety of other conditions, including neoplastic processes may also be responsible. As a result, we recommend obtaining a vertebral body biopsy prior to every vertebral augmentation procedure.",eng,1.0

In balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, we have two minimally invasive treatment procedures available. Although they have both been controversially discussed in studies, they have seldom been directly compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2004, patients with fresh thoracic or lumbar single-segment vertebral compression fractures not involving neurological deficits were treated by balloon kyphoplasty (n = 30) or vertebroplasty(n = 30) using PMMA cement, and the results of the two interventions were compared in a prospective, nonrandomised cohort study. Surgery was indicated when patients had painful, dislocated fractures of type A1 and type A3 according to Magerl's classification. The outcome of treatment was assessed with special reference to the angle of kyphosis, back pain (VAS), health-related quality of life (SF-36) and complications. RESULTS: At the time of the follow-up examination, significant improvement in the angle of kyphosis was found to have been achieved both by kyphoplasty and by vertebroplasty (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Comparison showed that correction of the angle was significantly (P < 0.001) better in the kyphoplasty group. Both surgical procedures led to significant (P < 0.001) attenuation of the patients' pain; no difference was observed between the groups in the degree of pain relief achieved. There was no demonstrable correlation in either group between the preoperative pain experienced by the patients and the degree of dislocation of their fractures. In both study groups, the quality of life was in keeping with that of a reference group matched for age and sex. Cement leakage was observed in 7% of patients after kyphoplasty and in 33% of patients after vertebroplasty (P = 0.021). Adjacent-level fractures were checked for, but occurred in only one patient in the vertebroplasty group. CONCLUSION: The two surgical procedures were both followed by significant pain relief, and the quality of life was similar regardless of the procedure used. Balloon kyphoplasty led to an ongoing reduction of freshly fractured vertebrae and was followed by a lower rate of cement leakage.",eng,0.0

If operative therapy is necessary, open procedures might be problematic for elderly patients. In this case, balloon kyphoplasty might be an alternative. METHODS: We present our prospective data of 30 patients with an average age of 72 years (range 65-82). The patients suffered from isolated thoracic and lumbar fractures (T6-L4) without neurological deficits and were operated on with balloon kyphoplasty. They were followed up an average of 13 months after surgery. RESULTS: Before surgery, the patients' average kyphotic angle was 12 degrees . After reduction with balloon kyphoplasty, this angle was significantly improved to 7 degrees , and at follow-up it was 8 degrees . Back pain, which was determined by a visual analogous scale, showed a significant reduction from 8.2 to 2.6 points at follow-up. No significant relationship between preoperative pain and improvement of the kyphotic angle could be found. Patients with a bad fracture reposition showed significantly more pain at follow-up.

This was caused by myelon compression following pyogenic spondylitis with a psoas abscess. Computed tomography guided aspiration of the abscess cavity yielded group C Streptococcus. The psoas abscess was percutaneously drained and laminectomy and posterior instrumentation with an internal fixator from the eleventh thoracic vertebra to the fourth lumbar vertebra was performed. In a second operation, corpectomy of the first lumbar vertebra with cement removal and fusion from the twelfth thoracic vertebra to the second lumbar vertebra with a titanium cage was performed. Six weeks postoperatively, the patient was pain free with no neurologic deficits or signs of infection. CONCLUSION: Pyogenic spondylitis is an extremely rare complication after kyphoplasty.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 47 patients (29 women, 18 men; mean age: 70 years and 4 months) with severe VCFs, 66 BA-VPs were performed via a unipedicular access. After initial puncture (under combined fluoroscopy and CT guidance) of the vertebral body (VB), the needle was retraced by 1.5 cm, and a 12-mm Fogarty balloon catheter was introduced and inflated using 2-4 ml diluted contrast media (CM). After the subsequent removal of the catheter and repositioning of the needle, vertebroplasty was performed. RESULTS: The mean volume of PMMA injected was 4.4 ml (2.5-7.2 ml). Pain reduction (measured by the Visual Analogue Scale) was achieved in 95 % of the patients, dropping from on average 8.0 pre-intervention to 2.2 after a mean follow-up of 8 months. A reduction of the pain relieving medication was achieved in 68 % of the cases and patient activity improved markedly. No severe or clinically relevant complications were observed. Cement leakage occurred by filling of epidural and paravertebral veins in 9.1 and 6.1 % of the cases, respectively. Leakage into the paravertebral soft tissues was seen in 3.0 % of the patients and to the adjacent disc space in 10.6 % of the cases. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are currently used to treat osteoporotic VCFs but show either a comparatively high leakage rate or are rather complex and expensive. Balloon-assisted vertebroplasty seems to combine advantages from both methods and is effective, safe and comparatively inexpensive.",ger,0.0

Schmoelz,2013.0,Biomechanical comparison of vertebral augmentation with silicone and PMMA cement and two filling grades,10.1007/s00586-013-2908-0,"PURPOSE: Vertebral augmentation with PMMA is a widely applied treatment of vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures. Subsequent fractures are a common complication, possibly due to the relatively high stiffness of PMMA in comparison with bone. Silicone as an augmentation material has biomechanical properties closer to those of bone and might, therefore, be an alternative. The study aimed to investigate the biomechanical differences, especially stiffness, of vertebral bodies with two augmentation materials and two filling grades. METHODS: Forty intact human osteoporotic vertebrae (T10-L5) were studied. Wedge fractures were produced in a standardized manner. For treatment, PMMA and silicone at two filling grades (16 and 35 % vertebral body fill) were assigned to four groups. Each specimen received 5,000 load cycles with a high load range of 20-65 % of fracture force, and stiffness was measured. Additional low-load stiffness measurements (100-500 N) were performed for intact and augmented vertebrae and after cyclic loading. RESULTS: Low-load stiffness testing after cyclic loading normalized to intact vertebrae showed increased stiffness with 35 and 16 % PMMA (115 and 110 %) and reduced stiffness with 35 and 16 % silicone (87 and 82 %). After cyclic loading (high load range), the stiffness normalized to the untreated vertebrae was 361 and 304 % with 35 and 16 % PMMA, and 243 and 222 % with 35 and 16 % silicone augmentation. For both high and low load ranges, the augmentation material had a significant effect on the stiffness of the augmented vertebra, while the filling grade did not significantly affect stiffness. CONCLUSIONS: This study for the first time directly compared the stiffness of silicone-augmented and PMMA-augmented vertebral bodies. Silicone may be a viable option in the treatment of osteoporotic fractures and it has the biomechanical potential to reduce the risk of secondary fractures.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVES: To assess the applicability of the appropriateness criteria in real-life practice. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Eight practices of experts who participated in the panel study, including 2 interventional radiologists, one internal medicine specialist, 2 neurosurgeons, and 3 orthopedic/trauma surgeons. Practices were located in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. METHODS: Using an online data capture program, participants documented the clinical profile (age, gender, previous VCFs, time since fracture, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, evolution of symptoms, impact of symptoms on quality of life, spinal deformity, ongoing fracture process, and presence of pulmonary dysfunction) and treatment choice for consecutive patients who consulted them for OVCF. RESULTS: In total 426 patients were included. BKP was the most frequently chosen treatment option (49%), followed by VP (34%) and NSM (14%). When compared with the panel recommendations, inappropriate treatment choices were rare (5% for NSM, 2% for VP, none for BKP). Treatment choice was strongly associated with the clinical variables used in the panel study. Differences in treatment decisions between interventional radiologists and surgeons were largely determined by differences in patient characteristics, with time of clinical presentation being the dominant factor.

Cement augmentation (vertebroplasty of kyphoplasty) helps stabilize painful OVF refractory to medical treatment. This stabilization is thought to improve pain and functional outcome. Vertebroplasty consists of injecting cement into a fractured vertebra using a percutaneous transpedicular approach. Balloon kyphoplasty uses an inflatable balloon prior to injecting the cement. Although kyphoplasty is associated with significant improvement of local kyphosis and less cement leakage, this does not result in long-term clinical and functional improvement. Moreover, vertebroplasty is favored by some due to the high cost of kyphoplasty. The injection of cement increases the stiffness of the fracture vertebrae. This can lead, in theory, to adjacent OVF. However, many studies found no increase of subsequent fracture when comparing medical treatment to cement augmentation. Kyphoplasty can have a protective effect due to restoration of sagittal balance.",eng,0.0

Intraoperative 3-dimensional image-based navigation was used for needle placement in 21 cases (36 levels); conventional 2-dimensional fluoroscopy was used in the other 9 cases (11 levels). The 2 groups were compared for rates of needle malposition and cement leakage as well as radiation exposure time. Three of 11 (27%) nonnavigated cases were complicated by a malpositioned needle, and 2 of these had to be repositioned. The navigated group had a significantly lower malposition rate (1 of 36; 3%; P=.04). The overall rate of cement leakage was also similar in both groups (P=.29). Radiation exposure time was similar in both groups (navigated, 98 s/level; nonnavigated, 125 s/level; P=.10). Navigated kyphoplasty procedures did not differ significantly from nonnavigated procedures except in terms of needle malposition rate, where navigation may have decreased the need for needle repositioning.",eng,0.0

METHODS: This retrospective study examined 206 patients who had undergone PVP for single level osteoporotic or osteopenic compression fractures during the last seven years in our department. After PVP, the patients were observed for at least over one year, and 29 patients showed new additional compression fractures in adjacent levels. One hundred seventy seven patients who did not show additional compression fractures were analyzed as the control group. Statistical comparisons were performed between the groups, in terms of age, gender, bone mineral density, whether bisphosphonate (BPP) was treated, preoperative kyphosis, preoperative wedge angle, change in wedge angle, amount of bone cement, existence of intradiscal bone cement leakage, and initial fracture levels. RESULTS: The statistically significant factors that influence new compression fractures in adjacent levels after PVP were as follows: being female, initial thoracolumbar junction fracture, preoperative large kyphotic, preoperative large wedge angle, change in wedge angle, administration of BPP in osteopenia group, and intradiscal cement leakage. CONCLUSION: This study identified many factors that influence newly developed compression fractures in adjacent levels after PVP. Interestingly, the administration of BPP in osteopenia group had positive influence on new fractures in this study. Therefore, we recommend early administration of BPP to patients with osteopenia.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To identify the effect of cement augmentation for cephalad vertebral fracture after instrumented lumbar fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporosis may contribute to cephalad vertebral fractures by an altered biomechanics in the adjacent segments due to the loss of motion at the fused segments. However, few studies on the treatment for cephalad fractures using bone cement augmentation after instrumented lumbar fusion have been published. METHODS: Seventeen patients who had cephalad vertebral fractures after instrumented lumbar fusion underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). All patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of intravertebral vacuum clefts (IVC) on plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging: group 1 consisted of 9 patients without an associated IVC and group 2 consisted of 8 patients with an IVC. The Oswestry Disability Index and the Visual Analogue Scale were recorded prospectively. The radiologic parameters of kyphotic deformity, vertebral height changes, and leakage of cement were studied. RESULTS: The Oswestry Disability Index and Visual Analogue Scale scores in group 1 decreased after PVP, but the mean score in group 2 was higher than in group 1 at the last follow-up. The mean kyphosis measured 15.7+/-7.4 degrees preoperatively and 15.6+/-7.1 degrees at the final follow-up in group 1, and 16.9+/-8.8 degrees preoperatively and 27.2+/-8.8 degrees at the final follow-up in group 2.The mean preoperative anterior and posterior vertebral height ratio measured 0.6+/-0.2 preoperatively and 0.6+/-0.2 at the final follow-up in group 1, and 0.6+/-0.2 preoperatively and 0.5+/-0.2 at the final follow-up in group 2.The mean preoperative middle and posterior vertebral height ratio measured 0.5+/-0.1 preoperatively and 0.6+/-0.1 at the final follow-up in group 1, and 0.5+/-0.1 preoperatively and 0.4+/-0.2 at the final follow-up in group 2. Four patients underwent revision surgery in group 2 and 1 in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Although PVP treatment may be a useful method for cephalad vertebral fractures after instrumented lumbar fusion in elderly patients with persistent unremitting back pain, recollapse of the vertebral body can occur after a PVP for cephalad or adjacent vertebral fractures with an IVC.",eng,1.0

Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in the cervical spine can be performed using an anteromedial or lateral approach. A 51-year-old woman with breast cancer had been experiencing severe weight-bearing neck pain for 2 months, even after undergoing radiation therapy. Imaging studies revealed an osteolytic compression fracture in the C7 vertebra. For performing PVP at C7 using the anteromedial approach, a needle was inserted from the left side of the patient's neck. The needle was advanced to the anterior 1/3 anterior 1/3 or 1/2 of the vertebral body by hammering, and approximately 2 ml of cement was injected. Immediately after the operation, the patient could move her neck without pain.

METHODS: Patients (age 68 +/- 13 yr, weight 66 +/- 6 kg) undergoing PV for osteoporotic fractures were randomized prospectively into two groups: NP (n=50) and IL (n=50). All patients were premedicated (oral hydroxyzine 1 mg.kg(-1)) and had skin infiltration with 5 mL of 1% lidocaine prior to vertebral puncture. Thirty minutes before the procedure, Group NP received, in a blinded manner, 50 mL of iv nalbuphine (0.3 mg.kg(-1)) and propacetamol (30 mg.kg(-1)) while Group IL received 50 mL of iv saline. During vertebral puncture, Groups NP and IL received, in a blinded manner, 1 mL.10 kg(-1) of intraosseous saline and 1% lidocaine respectively. Pain was assessed during vertebral puncture and cement injection with a four-point verbal rating scale. Additionally, lidocaine plasma kinetics were obtained in 11 IL patients. RESULTS: Analgesic efficacy was similar in the IL and NP groups (85 vs 84%). Group NP had more side effects. Lidocaine peak recorded concentration was 2.6 +/- 0.1 microg.mL(-1) i.e., about three times less than the reported toxic limits. CONCLUSION: IL is as effective as the association of iv NP for analgesia in PV. However, considering that both protocols were insufficient in about 15% of cases, other modalities are needed to further improve analgesia and avoid general anesthesia during vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

The procedure is brief but painful during vertebral puncture and cement injection requiring either general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care with opioids. The optimal dose of alfentanil in this setting is unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine its median effective dose (ED50, or analgesic efficacy in 50% of patients) during PVP in none intubated, spontaneously breathing patients. After approval and informed consent of the Institutional Review Board, 50 patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists II-III, age 50 to 80, weight: 53 to 82 kg) with osteoporotic vertebral fractures were enrolled. The patients were premedicated with oral hydroxyzine 100 mg and had skin infiltration with 50 mg lidocaine before vertebral puncture. The prone position was adopted and oxygen was provided via a facemask. Noninvasive cardiorespiratory variables were monitored. Pain was evaluated by a numerical pain scale (NPS) where 0 represents no pain and 10 the worst tolerable pain. Alfentanil infusion was started 30 minutes before vertebral puncture. The initial dose was 2.0 mg/h. Thereafter, a 0.05 mg/h decrease or increase was applied to the next patient if analgesia was effective (NPS: 3 or less) or not (NPS>3) according to the Dixon method. The bootstrap resampling technique was used to calculate the ED50 and its 95% confidence limits. The latter was 1.05 mg/h (95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.2). Transient apnea (n=2) and nausea/vomiting (n=3) were observed. Given the median body weight of the patients (65 kg), we conclude that 0.27 microg kg/min of alfentanil provides effective analgesia for PVP under monitored anesthesia care. SUMMARY STATEMENT: PVP consists of injecting small quantities of orthopedic cement to consolidate pathologic vertebral bodies. The median effective dose (ED50) for pain relief during vertebral puncture and cement injection is 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.2) mg/h when infusion is started 30 minutes before the procedure. Given the median body weight of our study population (65 kg), this dose corresponds to 0.27 microg kg/min.",eng,1.0

This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at the division of orthopedic surgery in a tertiary medical center between January 2008 and October 2010. The medical charts of consecutive elderly (>/= 65 years) patients admitted for spine fracture surgery were studied for the following measurements: ANSS, demographic data, co-morbidities, and post-operative complications. Except for pressure ulcers, post-operative complications included: acute coronary syndrome, acute renal failure, confusion, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, venous thromboembolism, and wound infection. The final cohort included 90 patients: 66 (73.3%) females and 24 (26.7%) males. Mean age for the entire cohort was 78.9 +/- 0.7 years. Most patients had lumbar fractures (n=49; 54.4%) or thoracal fractures (n=26; 28.9%). Most patients underwent kyphoplasty (n=65; 72.2%). Mean ANSS was 15.9 +/- 0.3, and 29 (32.2%) patients had low (<15) ANSS. Patients with low ANSS had significantly more post-operative complications relative to patients with high ANSS (1.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 0.2 +/- 0.1; p<0.0001). Among all post-operative complications, urinary tract infection was independently associated with ANSS (p<0.0001). Binary regression analysis showed that ANSS were independently associated with post-operative complications (p=0.001). We conclude that low ANSS are associated with post-operative complications and urinary tract infection in particular, following spine fracture surgery in the elderly. Hence, the Norton scoring system may be used for predicting and preventing post-operative complications in this population.",eng,0.0

Case report,", ","The authors report the case of patient with a lumbar vertebral body osteoporotic compression fracture who underwent percutaneous transpedicular polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-assisted vertebroplasty in whom extravasation of the cement into the spinal canal caused immediate neurological deterioration. Lateral lumbar radiography and computerized tomography scanning demonstrated the presence of intraspinal PMMA. The patient suffered severe low-back pain, left-sided sciatica, and profound left L2-4 distribution weakness and numbness. She underwent immediate L-2 laminectomy, the extra- and intradural PMMA was removed, and instrumentation-assisted lateral mass fusion was performed. The patient recovered without incident and her neurological deficit improved. Extravasation of cement into the spinal canal, neural foramen, paraspinal veins, or disc space has been reported in 11 to 73% of percutaneous transpedicular PMMA-assisted vertebroplasty procedures. It is disturbing that more than one group of authors has documented symptomatic spinal canal PMMA extravasation and that the patients were left severely handicapped because of a stated fear that surgery to remove the cement would be difficult and make them worse. The results achieved in this case refute that published notion. It is important to document that decompressive surgery and PMMA removal from the spinal canal are easy and can lead to immediate neurological improvement. With the increasing popularity of percutaneous transpedicular PMMA-assisted vertebroplasty, the authors suspect that more of these cases will be seen.",eng,0.0

Although percutaneous vertebroplasty is considered a relatively safe and technically simple procedure, it is also associated with life-threatening complications as a result of cement leakage, including cardiac perforation and pulmonary embolism. A 63-year-old woman underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty for an L3 vertebral fracture and had cement leaks into the inferior vena cava, pulmonary arteries, and right heart chambers, with a free wall perforation. Surgical removal of the cement emboli was recommended as a result of apparent penetration of the ventricle and the fragile nature of polymethyl methacrylate. A cardiopulmonary bypass was immediately performed via a right atriotomy. A foreign body 10 cm in length was removed from the right atrium and ventricle. Arteriotomies were then performed, and 4 cement filaments were retrieved from the pulmonary arteries. The inferior vena cava was also surgically opened, allowing extraction of a cement fragment that was 12 cm long. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient fully recovered. This is the first report of the migration of a cement fragment larger than 10 cm that had migrated and embedded in the heart chamber. This report showed that imaging analysis is valuable when cement leakage is detected during percutaneous vertebroplasty and can be used to avoid serious complications and improve patient outcomes.",eng,1.0

Pain, function, the Cobb angle, and the anterior and middle height of the vertebral body were assessed before and after operation. Leakage of bone cement was recorded. The post-operative change in the Cobb angle was significantly greater in the dilator kyphoplasty group than in the balloon kyphoplasty group (-9.51 degrees (sd 2.56) vs -7.78 degrees (sd 1.19), p < 0.001)). Leakage of cement was less in the dilator kyphoplasty group. No other significant differences were found in the two groups after operation, and both procedures gave equally satisfactory results in terms of all other variables assessed.

Between January 2008 and September 2011, one hundred twenty-six patients with a single-level osteoporotic compression fracture who underwent kyphoplasty were evaluated for a minimum of 1 year postoperatively. Nine independent variables related to patient characteristics (age, sex, bone mineral density [BMD], and body mass index), fracture characteristics (fracture level, fracture age, and preoperative kyphotic angle), and surgical variables (total injected cement volume and cement leakage) were assessed. Kyphotic angle reduction was the dependent variable. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to determine the factors associated with kyphotic angle reduction.Significant improvements occurred in mean anterior vertebral height variation, middle vertebral height variation, kyphotic angle, and visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores immediate postoperatively and at final follow-up compared with the preoperative values. Univariate analyses indicated correlations between kyphotic angle reduction with BMD, fracture age, preoperative kyphotic angle, and cement volume. The final multiple linear regression model resulted in a formula that accounted for 23.3% of the variability in kyphotic angle reduction: preoperative kyphotic angle (b=0.260; P=.002), BMD (b=-0.249; P=.004), and fracture age (b=-0.226; P=.009).

METHODS: From February 2005 to October 2008, 71 patients with OVCF were treated by PKP and were retrospectively analyzed. There were 16 males and 55 females, and the average age was 71.5 years (range, 52-91 years). The average duration of disease was 5.7 months (range, 1-11 months). A total of 171 vertebra were involved in fracture including 19 cases of single vertebral fractures, 21 cases of double vertebral fractures, 20 cases of three vertebral fractures, and 11 cases of more than three vertebral fractures. All the treated vertebra were divided into acute (86 vertebra) or subacute (85 vertebra) state based on changes in MRI signal intensity. There was no radiculopathy or myelopathy. The average injected cement volume was 4.6 mL (range, 1.5-6.5 mL). The treatment efficacy was assessed by observing the change in anterior and middle vertebral column height, Cobb angle, visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry functional score at preoperation, 3 days after operation and last follow-up. The patients were divided into cement leakage group and no cement leakage group. All the complications were recorded, and then the correlative factors affecting the complications were analyzed. RESULTS: All the cases had rapid and significant improvement in back pain following PKP. All patients were followed up for 14 months (range, 7-18 months). There was no cement extravasation resulting in radiculopathy or myelopathy. Four patients (5.63%) had lung-related complications. During the follow-up, 9 recurrence vertebral fractures were observed in 6 patients (8.45%). The anterior and middle vertebral column height, Cobb angle, VAS and Oswestry score were significantly improved when compared with preoperation (P < 0.05). Cement leakage occurred in 17 (9.94%) vertebral bodies; of 17 cases, the cement leaked into the paravertebral space in 7 cases, intervertebral space in 6 cases, channel of needling insertion in 3 cases, and spinal canal in 1 case. Univariate analysis showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in preoperative anterior and middle vertebral column height, injected cement volume and vertebral body wall incompetence between the cement leakage group and no cement leakage group. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in preoperative Cobb angle, freshness of vertebral fracture, location of operative vertebrae and operative approach between the two groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the injected cement volume [odds ratio (OR)=3.105, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.674-5.759, P < 0.01] and vertebral body wall incompetence (OR = 11.960, 95% CI = 3.512-40.729, P < 0.01) were the predominant variable associated with the complications resulted from cement leakage. CONCLUSION: The injected cement volume and vertebral body wall incompetence were the factors affecting the complications. The improvement of surgical technique is the capital factor that may reduce the complications in the PKP.",chi,0.0

The preoperative and postoperative (3 days, 3 months) PFT parameters were as follows: % pred FVC, 74.33 +/- 12.35, 85.23.8 +/- 13.23, and 84.86 +/- 14.01; % pred FEV1, 60.23 +/- 11.2, 60.02 +/- 11.90, and 60.78 +/- 12.70; FEV1/FVC ratio (%), 68.22 +/- 16.74, 59.56 +/- 13.23, and 60.77 +/- 12.28, % pred MVV 52.46 +/- 14.37, 55.23 +/- 15.68, and 62.12 +/- 14.48, respectively. The preoperative mean VAS score was 8.01 +/- 1.41 and significantly decreased to 2.52 +/- 0.89 and 2.34 +/- 0.78 at 3 days, 3 months after kyphoplasty, respectively. The preoperative local kyphotic angle degree was 21.96 +/- 5.75 degrees , significantly decreased to 13.48 +/- 6.12 degrees 3 days after KP, and maintained 3 month after KP. The decrease in the VAS scores correlated with the PFT parameters; however, there were no significant correlations between the PFT parameters and the LKA, the VAS scores and the LKA. Kyphoplasty under local anesthesia is a safety treatment for the COPD patients with OVCFS, and is able to improve the lung function impaired by OVCFs.",eng,0.0

METHODS: From April 2007 to October 2009, 16 cases (23 vertebrae) of symptomic old OVCF were treated with a modified PVP. Before operation, all the patients were examined by standing anteroposterior and lateral X-Ray and MRI. The pain level of each patient was assessed before operation and 1 week, 6, 12 months after the operation using visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI). The middle line vertebral body height and local sagittal Cobb's angle were also measured. RESULTS: Postoperative average VAS, Oswestry disability index (ODI), the local sagittal Cobb's angle decreased from 7.8, 72.3%, and 38.2 degrees to 3.1, 26.8%, and 21.5 degrees respectively before and after surgery (p<0.05). The mean midline vertebral height increased from 13.8mm to 26.6mm before and after surgery (p<0.05). There was no infection, nerve injury, pulmonary embolism, or death after operation. CONCLUSIONS: The modified PVP can increase the space for bone cement filling and is good for the restoration of vertebral body height. It is an optimal procedure for the treatment of painful old OVCF.",eng,0.0

Therefore, aggressive treatment is particularly important. Traditional surgical method,such as laminectomy and internal fixation has large trauma,more blood loss and high failure rate. However, conservative treatment cannot early reduce pain symptoms and improve functional status,it can lead delayed union and severe ossification and form chronic OVCF,make more difficult to treat. In treatment of vertebral body fracture,there was a new way with the development of minimally invasive spinal surgery technology.

Journal Article,M. M. Shi; X. Z. Cai; T. Lin; W. Wang; S. G. Yan,2012.0,Is there really no benefit of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral fractures? A meta-analysis,10.1007/s11999-012-2404-6,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic vertebral compressed fractures (VCFs) are the most common osteoporotic fractures. Although percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) reportedly relieves pain and improves function, a recent pooled analysis from two multicenter randomized controlled trials concluded the improvement in pain and disability treated with PVP was similar to those with sham surgery. QUESTIONS/PURPOSE: Using meta-analysis we therefore asked whether compared with either nonoperative therapy or a sham injection for patients with VCF, PVP would (1) better relieve pain, (2) provide greater improvement in pain-related disability, and (3) increase the recurrence of vertebral fractures. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and the Cochrane library using the keywords vertebroplasty AND osteoporosis OR fracture"". We included nine of the 469 articles identified. Using a random effects model, we calculated the weighted mean differences to evaluate the pain reduction at different times as the primary outcome. Pain-related disability was assessed by a quality of life (QOL) measure. Improvement of QOL and recurrence of vertebral fractures were the secondary outcomes. We used subgroup analysis to reinvestigate pain relief and function improvement of PVP based on two different controls: nonoperative therapy and sham injection. The total number of patients was 886. RESULTS: Pain scoring was similar between the PVP group and the sham injection group at 1 to 29 days and 90 days. However, compared with nonoperative therapy, PVP reduced pain at all times studied. QOL in the PVP group was improved or tended to be improved compared with QOL for both control groups. The risk of new fractures was similar between the PVP groups and both control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Different control groups may have accounted for the different conclusions in the literature regarding the ability of PVP to relieve pain and restore function recovery. Compared with nonoperative treatment PVP relieved pain better and improved QOL. PVP did not increase the risk of new fractures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

We performed a metaanalysis of prospective, randomized controlled and clinical controlled trials of PVP and BKP to determine the efficacy and safety for the treatment of OVCFs to reach a relatively conclusive answer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched computerized databases comparing efficacy and safety of PVP and BKP in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. These reports included pain relief, functional capacity (Oswestry disability index [ODI] score), anterior vertebral body height (AVBH), kyphotic angle and complications (i.e. cement leakage, incident fractures). Studies were assessed for methodological bias and potential reasons for heterogeneity were explored. RESULTS: As of March 15, 2013, a PubMed search resulted in 761 articles, of which eleven studies encompassing 789 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The average length of followup is 17 months and 4.6% patients were lost to followup. Results of metaanalysis indicated that BKP is more effective for short term pain relief. In addition, BKP is more effective to restore the AVBH (anterior vertebral body height), ODI and kyphotic angle of OVCFs. Moreover, BKP need more polymethylmethacrylate amount. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of better effectiveness of BKP procedure, we believe BKP to be superior over PVP for the treatment of osteoporotic VCFs.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: PVP was performed in 50 patients with metastatic disease or multiple myeloma between June 1998 and April 2002. Twenty-five women (mean age, 62.3 years; range, 38-85 years) and 25 men (mean age, 63.1 years; range, 37-92 years) were included. Cases were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who had undergone cross-sectional imaging were classified into three groups. First group had no epidural involvement; second group, mild epidural involvement without contact with spinal cord or nerve roots; third group, moderate involvement and contact with spinal cord or nerve roots. Procedural safety was evaluated with review of all post-PVP complications and their treatment. Effectiveness was evaluated with follow-up phone calls for assessment of change in pain level and activity after PVP. Follow-up calls were performed at 1 day; 2 weeks; 1, 3, and 6 months; and 1 and 2 years. Differences between groups were assessed with singly ordered Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were classified in the first group, 18 in the second, and 18 in the third. There were no significant differences in pain or mobility outcomes among groups. At the last follow-up call, 41 (82%) of 50 patients reported improvement in pre-PVP pain. Six (12%) reported no change, and three (6%) reported increased pain. After PVP in 26 (52%) patients, there was a period of increased mobility; in 19 (38%), no improvement in mobility occurred; and in five (10%), decreased mobility was reported. Complications included acute increased pain or new areas of pain in seven (14%) patients. None of these required surgery; four were treated with nerve root block; two, with central epidural injection; and one, with overnight intravenous steroids.

The authors report on 4 cases of delayed pyogenic spondylitis (DPS) following vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty for osteoporotic compression fractures and metastatic disease. Four patients presented with DPS after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty and underwent surgical treatment. Clinical history, laboratory examination, and MR imaging confirmed the diagnosis of DPS. Anterior debridement, reconstruction, and posterior instrumented fusion were performed. The mean interval for the delayed occurrence of pyogenic spondylitis after surgery was 12.3 months. The infections were primarily bacterial in origin, but most patients also suffered diverse medical comorbidities. Despite successful treatment of the infections, comorbidity was and is a factor that compromises good results. Medical comorbidities associated with compromised immunity may increase susceptibility to DPS after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. In cases of incapacitating back pain after a pain-free period following either of these surgeries, evaluation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level and examination of contrast-enhanced MR imaging studies are essential to rule out delayed vertebral infection. Surgical treatment requires cement removal and anterior reconstruction with or without additional posterior instrumented fusion. [References: 44]",English,1.0

Yoon,2009.0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic burst fractures,10.1007/s00701-009-0189-5,"BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure which involves injecting polymethylmethacrylate into the compressed vertebral body. At present the indications include the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures, vertebral myeloma, and metastases. The value of vertebroplasty in osteoporotic compression fracture has been discussed comprehensively. The surgical operation for burst fractures without neurological deficit remains controversial. Some authors have asserted that vertebroplasty is contraindicated in patients with burst fracture. However, we performed the procedure, after considering the patents general condition, to reduce surgical risks and the duration of immobilisation. The purpose of this study is to investigate clinical outcomes, kyphosis correction, wedge angle, and height restoration of thoraco-lumbar osteoporotic burst fractures treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with osteoporotic burst fracture were treated with postural reduction followed by vertebroplasty. We measured the kyphosis, wedge angle, spinal canal compromise and the height of the fractured vertebral body initially, after postural reduction, and after vertebroplasty. FINDINGS: The average height of the collapsed vertebral bodies was 24.8% of the original height. Average kyphosis angle was 19.4 degrees and average wedge angle was 19.8 degrees at first. Mean canal encroachment was initially 25.1%. Kyphosis angle, wedge angle, and anterior, middle, and posterior height improved significantly after the procedure. The mean amelioration of the spinal canal encroachment after vertebroplasty was 23.3%. The average increase in anterior vertebral body height was 7.5 mm, central was 5.8 mm, and posterior was 0.9 mm. The mean reduction in kyphosis angle was 6.8 degrees and the mean reduction in wedge angle was 9.7 degrees . CONCLUSION: Although vertebroplasty has been considered as contraindicated in thoraco-lumbar burst fractures, we successfully used the procedure as a safe treatment in patients with osteoporotic burst fracture without neurologic deficit. This method could eliminate the need for and risks of major spinal surgery. We would like to offer it as a relatively safe and effective methods of management in thoraco-lumbar burst fractures.",eng,1.0

Lane,2006.0,Vertebral height restoration in osteoporotic compression fractures: kyphoplasty balloon tamp is superior to postural correction alone,10.1007/s00198-006-0195-x,"INTRODUCTION: Kyphoplasty has been shown to restore vertebral height and sagittal alignment. Proponents of vertebroplasty have recently demonstrated that many vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are mobile and positional correction can lead to clinically significant height restoration. The current investigation tested the hypothesis that positional maneuvers do not achieve the same degree of vertebral height correction as kyphoplasty balloon tamps for the reduction of low-energy VCFs. METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients with a total of 43 osteoporotic VCFs were entered into a prospective analysis. Each patient was sequentially evaluated for postural and balloon vertebral fracture reduction. Preoperative standing and lateral radiographs of the fractured vertebrae were compared with prone cross-table lateral radiographs with the patient in a hyper-extension position and on pelvic and sternal rolls. Following positional manipulation, patients underwent a unilateral balloon kyphoplasty. Postoperative standing radiographs were evaluated for the percentage of height restoration related to positioning and balloon kyphoplasty. RESULTS: In the middle portion of the vertebrae, the percentage available for restoration restored with extension positioning was 10.4% (median 11.1%) and after balloon kyphoplasty was 57.0% (median 62.2%). This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Thus, kyphoplasty provided an additional 46.6% of the height available for restoration from the positioning alone. With operative positioning, 51.2% of VCFs had >10% restoration of the central portion of the vertebral body, whereas 90.7% of fractures improved at least 10% following balloon kyphoplasty (p<0.002). CONCLUSION: Although this study supports the concept that many VCFs can be moved with positioning, balloon kyphoplasty enhanced the height reduction >4.5-fold over the positioning maneuver alone and accounted for over 80% of the ultimate reduction. If height restoration is the goal, kyphoplasty is clearly superior in most cases to the positioning maneuver alone.",eng,0.0

Lane,2006.0,Unsuspected lymphoma diagnosed with use of biopsy during kyphoplasty,10.2106/jbjs.f.00100,"BACKGROUND: Vertebral augmentation procedures are currently widely performed to treat vertebral compression fractures. In selecting appropriate patients for these procedures, it is important to distinguish the pain caused by a fracture from other causes of back pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of underlying, previously unrecognized malignant tumors in a consecutive series of patients undergoing kyphoplasty to treat vertebral compression fractures. Our hypothesis was that an unsuspected malignant tumor will exist and that a bone-marrow aspiration from the iliac crest would enhance our ability to detect a malignant tumor. METHODS: A prospective histological evaluation of vertebral body biopsy specimens from presumed osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and a concurrent bone-marrow aspiration from the iliac crest were performed in order to identify latent hematopoietic dyscrasias. Over a four-year period, vertebral body biopsies from 523 vertebral levels as well as iliac crest bone-marrow aspirations were performed in 238 patients. Both specimens were evaluated histologically, and the prevalence of an underlying occult malignant neoplasm was determined. RESULTS: All specimens from the vertebral bodies showed signs of bone-remodeling and/or fracture-healing. However, in three patients, both the bone biopsy specimen and the bone-marrow aspirate showed evidence of B-cell lymphoma. The bone-marrow aspirate did not provide any additional information compared with the vertebral body biopsy specimen, and multiple myeloma was not identified in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphoma is an uncommon cause of a vertebral compression fracture, but on the basis of our experience in this series, we recommend that vertebral body biopsy specimens be obtained in all patients managed with kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty to rule out an unsuspected malignant tumor. However, we do not recommend the routine use of an additional bone-marrow aspiration from the iliac crest during vertebral augmentation procedures because doing so did not appear to enhance our ability to detect a malignant tumor.",eng,0.0

There are approximately 700,000 vertebral body compression fractures in the United States each year with approximately 70,000 of these resulting in hospitalization, with an average hospital stay per patient of eight days. Osteolytic lesions of the spine are also a growing problem, affecting as many as 70% of patients with metastatic disease or multiple myeloma.

OBJECTIVE: To compare two kyphoplasty techniques in cadaveric fractured vertebrae: an experimental vertebral jack tool (VJT) and an inflatable bone tamp (IBT). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A previous biomechanical study showed restored strength and stiffness after height restoration in cadaveric-fractured osteoporotic vertebrae using a new device for reduction of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. METHODS: Anterior wedge fractures (AO type A1.2) were created in 8 (4 lumbar, 4 thoracic) vertebrae by displacement eccentric external forces. In all vertebrae the amount of height reduction was 35%. After compression, 4 vertebrae were restored in height using the VJT procedure. Four vertebrae were restored in height using the IBT procedure. Posttreatment strength and stiffness of the vertebrae were determined by a compression test identical to the pretreatment compression protocol. RESULTS.: In the VJT group the post-restoration strength was 81% +/- 13% of the original strength and in the IBT group it was 96% +/- 32%. The post-restoration stiffness in the VJT group was 61% +/- 42% of the original stiffness and in the IBT group 76% +/- 62% of the original stiffness. The vertebrae in the VJT group were restored to 101% +/- 2% of their original height whereas this was 104% +/- 14% in the IBT group. In this study, no cases of cement leakage were found. No cases of damaging of the end plates, new fractures or perforations were seen in both groups. The mean amount of cement inserted for the VJT group was 3.6 +/- 0.9 cm and for the IBT group 5.9 +/- 0.8 cm. CONCLUSION: Both kyphoplasty procedures were able to restore height in this in vitro study, while strength and stiffness were partially restored, with no significant differences. In this study on average significant less cement was used in the VJT procedure. No complications were noted in both groups. This new end plate-to-end plate laminar augmentation technique may be of clinical advantage.",eng,1.0

This is also associated with the increased incidence of complications related with these procedures, the most frequent being originated by leakage of cementation material. Cement can escape into the vertebral venous system and reach the pulmonary circulation through the azygous system and cava vein, producing a cement embolism. This is a frequent complication, occurring in up to 26% of patients undergoing vertebroplasty but, since most patients have no clinical or hemodynamical repercussion, this event usually goes unnoticed. However, some serious, and even fatal cases, have been reported. We report the case of a 74-year-old male patient who underwent vertebroplasty for persistent pain associated with osteoporotic L3 vertebral fracture and who developed a cement leak into the cava vein and right pulmonary artery during the procedure. Although he developed a pulmonary cement embolism, the patient remained asymptomatic and did not present complications during follow-up.","eng

However, we decided after multidisciplinary staff decision to perform vertebroplasty for few severe vertebral fractures which were still painful after optimal medical treatment. We retrospectively studied the charts of patients who benefited from vertebroplasty for severe vertebral body compression fracture between May 2006 and January 2012 in a rheumatology department. Clinical and biological data were collected and patients were consulted to assess effectiveness of that technique. We performed vertebroplasty of 12 severe vertebral fractures in 10 patients (nine women and one man). Mean age was 74.9+/-10.7 years. Mean VAS score was 9/10+/-1.15 before vertebroplasty and 2.4+/-2 after. Global improvement was 80% and patient satisfaction was 7/10. After vertebroplasty, use of drugs was significantly reduced or even stopped. The complications observed were: three infraclinical cement leakages, one haematoma at the site of the puncture, one atrial fibrillation and one classic pulmonary embolism. Mean follow-up was 28.6+/-22.3 months. Vertebroplasty is indeed a delicate procedure for severe vertebral fracture but quickly and sustainably effective.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,A. Simony; E. J. Hansen; M. Gaurilcikas; N. Abildgaard; M. O. Andersen,2014.0,Pain reduction after percutaneous vertebroplasty for myeloma-associated vertebral fractures,", ","INTRODUCTION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a minimally invasive procedure with cement augmentation of vertebral fractures. It was introduced in 1987 as a treatment for painful haemangiomas and is today mostly used for painful osteoporotic fractures of the spine. Two randomised, double-blinded trials published in 2009 have raised a debate about the efficiency of the PVP treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of PVP for vertebral body fractures in myeloma patients. METHODS: A consecutive group of patients with multiple myeloma who underwent PVP were reviewed. A total of 64 levels were treated on 17 patients during 24 sessions. All procedures were performed in local anaesthesia; no patients complained about discomfort during the procedure. RESULTS: The median preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 7.6. Improvement was observed in all patients. The median VAS pain score decreased to 3.2 at the three-month follow-up. The results are statistically significant. No complications were observed either during or after the treatment. We observed cement leakage in 12.5% of the patients, but no patients with cement leakage had clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: PVP is a safe and efficient procedure in the treatment of painful vertebral fractures in patients with multiple myeloma. The main advantages are the immediate stabilisation of the fractured vertebral body, reduction of the pain level and the fact that the patient can be discharged after two hours. The procedure can be repeated for several levels, and the pain relieving effect seems to be permanent. FUNDING: not relevant. TRIAL REGISTRATION: not relevant.",eng,1.0

Eberl,2016.0,Balloon kyphoplasty and percutaneous fixation of lumbar fractures in pediatric patients,10.1007/s00586-014-3686-z,"PURPOSE: Type A fractures of the spine requiring operative stabilization are rare injuries in the pediatric population. Current reports have demonstrated the safety of the combination of balloon kyphoplasty and minimal invasive management of thoraco-lumbar fractures in adults. There is no information about the efficacy of this approach in managing pediatric vertebral fractures. METHODS: The aim of the present study was to report the outcome of a small series of children with A fractures of the lumbar spine treated with the combination of the abovementioned techniques. RESULTS: Three male patients without neurological deficits aged 11, 12 and 14 years were treated with fractures located at L1, L1/L2 and L2/L3, respectively. In total, six kyphoplasties were performed (monolateral in 4 vertebrae, bilateral in one vertebra). Neither cases of cement leakage nor intra- or postoperative complications were noted. Minimally invasive kyphoplasty and stabilization led to a significant improvement of the sagittal index of all five treated vertebrae which could be maintained at follow-up (14, 19 and 20 months postoperatively). CONCLUSION: This study is the first one to present an excellent outcome of children with type A fractures treated with a combination of balloon kyphoplasty and percutaneous stabilization.",eng,0.0

Gilula,2006.0,Osteoporotic compression fractures: outcomes after single- versus multiple-level percutaneous vertebroplasty,10.1148/radiol.2381042078,"PURPOSE: To compare single- and multiple-level percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) in terms of pain relief, activity level, and analgesic use in patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained, and the study was HIPAA compliant. One hundred seventy-three patients (mean age at treatment, 73.8 years +/- 11.9 [standard deviation]) with 422 symptomatic osteoporotic VCFs underwent 204 treatment sessions for over 4 years. Pain immediately before and after PV was measured by using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain degree, activity level, and analgesic use were assessed at 2 weeks and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after PV by using telephone interview questionnaires. Data were analyzed by using a combination of paired t tests, analysis of variance, contingency tables, and chi2 tests. RESULTS: Findings of 172 PV treatment sessions for 149 patients (mean age at treatment, 73.4 years +/- 12), 110 (74%) of whom were women, were assessed; 32 treatment cases were lost to follow-up or lost owing to death. A single fracture level was treated at 65 sessions; two fracture levels, at 52 sessions; and three or more fracture levels, at 55 sessions. The mean VAS pain score decreased significantly (P < .001), from 76 +/- 21 before to 19 +/- 27 immediately after PV. Of the outcomes reported at 24 months, 82% (64 of 78 treatment sessions) were marked to complete resolution of the initial pain, 51% were complete cessation of analgesic use, and 51% were increased activity levels. These results did not differ greatly over time or when stratified into groups according to the number of fracture levels treated. CONCLUSION: PV performed at a single fracture level and that performed at multiple fracture levels were equally effective in facilitating long-term pain relief, increased activity level, and decreased analgesic use in patients with osteoporotic VCFs.",eng,1.0

Phillips,2005.0,Open vertebral cement augmentation combined with lumbar decompression for the operative management of thoracolumbar stenosis secondary to osteoporotic burst fractures,", ","Osteoporotic burst fractures with neurologic symptoms are typically treated with neural decompression and multilevel instrumented fusion. These large surgical interventions are challenging because of patients' advanced ages, medical co-morbidities, and poor fixation secondary to osteoporosis. The purpose of this retrospective clinical study was to describe a novel technique for the treatment of osteoporotic burst fractures and symptomatic spinal stenosis via a limited thoracolumbar decompression with open cement augmentation [vertebroplasty (VP) or kyphoplasty (KP)]. Indications for decompression and cement augmentation were intractable pain at the level of a known osteoporotic burst fracture with symptoms of spinal stenosis. As such, 25 patients (mean age, 76.1 years) with low-energy, osteoporotic, thoracolumbar burst fractures (7 males, 18 females; 39 fractures) were included. In all cases, laminectomy of the stenotic level(s) was followed by vertebral cement augmentation (9 VP; 16 KP). When a spondylolisthesis at the decompressed level was present, instrumentation was applied across the listhetic level (n = 9). Clinical outcome (1 = poor to 4 = excellent) was assessed on last clinical follow-up (mean, 44.8 wks). In addition, a modified MacNab's grading criteria was used to objectively assess patient outcomes postoperatively. Radiographic analysis of sagittal contour was assessed preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at final follow-up. The average time from onset of symptoms to intervention was 19 weeks (range, 0.3-94 wks). A mean of 1.6 fractures/patient was augmented (range, 1-3 fractures) and 2.8 levels were decompressed (range, 1-6 levels). No statistical difference in anatomic distribution or number of fractures between the VP and KP groups or in the instrumented versus noninstrumented patients was noted (P > 0.05). An overall subjective outcome score of 3.4 was noted. Twenty of 25 patients were graded as excellent/good according to the modified MacNab's criteria. The choice of augmentation procedure or use of instrumentation did not predict outcome (P = 0.08). Overall, 1.7 degrees of sagittal correction was obtained at final follow-up. One patient was noted to have progressive kyphosis after KP. The use of a limited-posterior decompression and open cement augmentation via VP or KP is a safe treatment option for patients who have osteoporotic burst fractures and who are incapacitated from fracture pain and concomitant stenosis. After thoracolumbar decompression, open VP/KP provides direct visualization of the posterior vertebral body wall, allowing for safe cement augmentation of burst fractures, stabilizing the spine, and obviating the need for extensive spinal reconstruction. Although clinically successful, this technique warrants careful patient selection.",eng,0.0

Howard,2014.0,Impact of negative clinical trial results for vertebroplasty on vertebral augmentation procedure rates,10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.03.047,"BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are procedures for treating vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). In August 2009, 2 randomized trials in the New England Journal of Medicine found that vertebroplasty did not reduce pain or disability relative to a sham procedure among patients with osteoporotic VCFs. STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated quarterly trends in per capita rates of vertebroplasties and kyphoplasties using the Florida hospital inpatient discharge and ambulatory surgery center databases from 2005 to 2012, supplemented with physician specialty and population data. We reported trends by procedure type, patient diagnosis, and physician specialty. We modeled the procedures as interrupted time series with a break when the clinical trials were published, and estimated changes in procedure rates and health expenditures resulting from the trials. RESULTS: The trials led to a 51.5% decline in the per capita vertebroplasty rate and a 40.0% decline in the kyphoplasty rate (both results p < 0.010) compared with what procedure rates would have been without the trials. Vertebroplasty rates for interventional radiologists displayed no significant change; rates for surgeons and other specialists declined by 73.1% (p < 0.010). Overall, these changes imply nationwide health expenditure savings of just over $1 billion per year. CONCLUSIONS: Publication of negative clinical trial results led to moderate reductions in vertebroplasties and kyphoplasties for osteoporotic VCFs. However, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty continue to be widely used to treat patients with osteoarthritis. Substantial differences in response across physicians suggest an important role for specialty society clinical guidelines in modulating how clinical evidence is incorporated into routine practice.",eng,1.0

Among minimally invasive procedures, percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) has shown excellent results in the treatment of chronic vertebral pain. The role of preintervention bone single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) has not been clearly established for the management of these patients. PURPOSE: To determine the value of bone SPECT-CT in patient selection, treatment planning, and prediction of response to PV. A comparison with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also aimed. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective consecutive series. PATIENT SAMPLE: We studied the performance of bone SPECT-CT on 33 consecutive patients with chronic pain because of vertebral fracture intended for PV. OUTCOME MEASURES: Improvement of clinical status was based on comparison of preprocedure and postprocedure outcome measurements of pain, mobility, and analgesic use. METHODS: Bone SPECT was done using a dual-detector variable-angle gamma camera coupled with a two-slice CT scanner (Symbia T2 System; Siemens, Munich, Germany). Magnetic resonance imaging was done using a magnet of 1.5 T (Giroscan System ACS NT Intera; Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). RESULTS: Of the 33 patients, 24 finally underwent PV. Positive SPECT-CT images predicted clinical improvement in 91% (21 of 23) of them. Agreement between SPECT-CT and MRI was 80% (20 of 25). Single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography images showed an alternative cause of pain in some cases, such as new fractures or multiple coexisting fractures, persisting bone remodeling in a previous cemented vertebra, and facet or discal degenerative disease. Single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography was mandatory in eight patients that could no receive MRI, all of whom improved after PV. CONCLUSIONS: Positive bone SPECT-CT seems a good predictor of postprocedural response. It also adds valuable information as to the cause of back pain and facilitates complete patient evaluation in patients that can not receive MRI.",eng,0.0

Further, the review assesses the treatment of posterior-element-associated pain in the setting of vertebral compression fracture in relation to vertebral augmentation. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2015, the only prospective randomized trial comparing percutaneous vertebroplasty with facet blockade was published in which authors found that percutaneous vertebroplasty produced better pain relief and function based on Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, and visual analog scale in the short term (</=1 week). However, differences in pain relief at 1 month and 12 months were not statistically significant. SUMMARY: The posterior elements may play a significant role in the pain generated after vertebral compression fractures. Treatment of the posterior element pain through medial branch radiofrequency ablation or facet injections may be another tool in providing analgesia in those with pain after vertebral compression fractures.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To assess the patterns and predictors of percutaneous vertebroplasty use among low-income Medicare beneficiaries from 1 U.S. state. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Many observational studies have examined the effectiveness of vertebroplasty, but none has described its pattern of use in the community. METHODS: We studied a cohort of low-income Medicare beneficiaries from Pennsylvania diagnosed with a spine fracture between 2001 and 2004. Healthcare utilization data were assessed to determine receipt of a vertebroplasty. The frequency of vertebroplasty among spine fracture patients was examined by year and by county of residence. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify correlates of receiving a vertebroplasty. RESULTS: We found 6392 patients who fulfilled our criteria for a spine fracture. Of these, 459 (7.2%) underwent a vertebroplasty in the subsequent 12 months. The percent of patients sustaining a fracture who underwent vertebroplasty increased from 6.8% to 8.2%, a 20% increase, over the 4-year study period. Substantial variation in use of vertebroplasty was observed across county of patient residence, with several counties having zero patients and many with >15% undergoing vertebroplasty. Several patient factors predicted use of vertebroplasty, including age 65 to 84 years (compared with 85 years and older), and more physician visits in the 12 months before the spine fracture. The model fit statistic (C statistic) for models with only patient factors was weak (c = 0.60), but this increased substantially when county of residence was also included in the model (c = 0.72). CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty use has generally increased over the study period. Patient characteristics determined from healthcare utilization data are weak correlates of vertebroplasty use, but a patient's county of residence is a relatively strong predictor.",eng,1.0

The present study compared the outcomes of two surgical strategies for the treatment of single-level acute OCF in the thoracolumbar junction (T12-L2). METHODS: From 2004 to 2010, 23 patients were allocated to the EVP group (EVPG) and 27 patients to the DVP group (DVPG). Overall mean age was 68.3+/-7.9 and minimum follow-up period was 1.0 year. Retrospective study of clinical and radiological results was conducted. RESULTS: No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between the two groups. As expected, mean duration from onset to vertebroplasty and mean duration of hospital stay were significantly longer in the DVPG (17.1+/-2.1 and 17.5+/-4.2) than in the EVPG (3.8+/-3.3 and 10.8+/-5.1, p=0.001). Final clinical outcome including visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index, and Odom's criteria did not differ between the two groups. However, immediate improvement of the VAS after vertebroplasty was greater in the EVPG (5.1+/-1.3) than in the DVPG (4.0+/-1.0, p=0.002). The proportion of cement leakage was lower in the EVPG (30.4%) than in the DVPG (59.3%, p=0.039). In addition, semiquantitative grade of cement interdigitation was significantly more favorable in the EVPG than in the DVPG (p=0.003). Final vertebral body collapse and segmental kyphosis did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that EVP achieves a better immediate surgical effect with more favorable cost-effectiveness.",eng,1.0

Oh,2009.0,Clinical and radiological comparison of unipedicular versus bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures,10.1007/s00198-009-0872-7,"SUMMARY: To evaluate the efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty in the treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, we compared the pre- and postoperative clinical and radiological results in the unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups. The clinical and radiological results of unipedicular kyphoplasty were as good as those of bipedicular kyphoplasty. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty in the treatment of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. We compared the pre- and postoperative compression ratios (CRs), kyphotic angles (KAs), and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the patients in the unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups. The results showed that the clinical and radiological results of unipedicular kyphoplasty were as good as those of bipedicular kyphoplasty. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty is a therapeutic option for patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). Due to the relatively high-risk nature of the patient population, complications such as myocardial events, seizures, agitation, or dyspnea may occur and render completion of the procedure imprudent. We analyzed the clinical and radiological results of unipedicular and bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 45 patients who underwent balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of VCFs between January 2005 and April 2008. A unipedicular approach was used in 15 patients and a bipedicular approach was used in 30 patients. The CR, KA, and 100-point VAS score for pain were measured pre- and postoperatively in each patient. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in restoration of the CR (p = 0.376) and KA (p = 0.888) between the unipedicular and bipedicular kyphoplasty groups. The patients in the unipedicular group showed greater improvement in VAS score than those in the bipedicular group (p < 0.001). There were no postoperative complications, such as nerve injury or pedicle fracture, in either of the two groups. CONCLUSION: The clinical and radiological results of unipedicular balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of VCFs were as good as those of bipedicular balloon kyphoplasty. Thus, unipedicular balloon kyphoplasty can be used as an alternative treatment for patients with VCFs.",eng,0.0

Recent meta-analyses have compared the incidence of secondary vertebral fractures between patients treated with vertebral augmentation techniques or conservative treatment; however, the inclusions were not thorough and rigorous enough, and the effects of each technique on the incidence of secondary vertebral fractures remain unclear. PURPOSE: To perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of the studies with more rigorous inclusion criteria on the effects of vertebral augmentation techniques and conservative treatment for OVCF on the incidence of secondary vertebral fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SpringerLink, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library database were searched for relevant original articles comparing the incidence of secondary vertebral fractures between vertebral augmentation techniques and conservative treatment for patients with OVCFs. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs) were identified. The methodological qualities of the studies were evaluated, relevant data were extracted and recorded, and an appropriate meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 13 articles were included. The pooled results from included studies showed no statistically significant differences in the incidence of secondary vertebral fractures between patients treated with vertebral augmentation techniques and conservative treatment. Subgroup analysis comparing different study designs, durations of symptoms, follow-up times, races of patients, and techniques were conducted, and no significant differences in the incidence of secondary fractures were identified (P > 0.05). No obvious publication bias was detected by either Begg's test (P = 0.360 > 0.05) or Egger's test (P = 0.373 > 0.05).

PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of a new method of PVP, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and interventional tumor removal (ITR) for malignant spinal tumor and malignant vertebral compression fractures without epidural involvement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve patients were treated with PVP, RFA, and ITR. A 14 G needle and a guidewire were inserted into the vertebral body, followed by sequential dilatation of the tract with the working cannula until the last working cannula reached the anterior portions of the pedicle. Thereafter, tumors were ablated with a radiofrequency probe, and ITR was performed with a marrow nucleus rongeurs. Then, cement was injected into the extirpated vertebral body. The data were collected and follow-up was performed after 1, 3, and 6 months, and thereafter every 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: PVP, RFA, and ITR were technically successful in all patients. The average preoperative pain visual analog scale (VAS) score was 7.0 +/- 1.0, which decreased to 2.1 +/- 1.2 at 1 month, to 1.6 +/- 1.4 at 6 months, to 1.8 +/- 1.7 at 1 year, and was maintained at 1.3 +/- 1.1 at >1-year follow-up. A total of 92% patients (11/12) obtained excellent and good pain relief with improvement of quality of life.

METHOD: 80 patients (32 males and 48 females), ranging from 62 to 88 years old with the mean age of 71.5 years, underwent surgery for the compressive fractures with posterior vertebral defect by percutaneous vertebroplasty combined with the spinal external fixator. All patients were diagnosed to have fresh compressive fractures with osteoporosis and posterior vertebral defect shown on roentgenograms, computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively. They underwent spinal external fixation firstly to be fixed and restored, then to be carried out percutaneous vertebroplasty. The mean follow-up was 24 months (16-42 months). Spinal canal encroachment, spinal cobb angle and vertebral body height loss were measured to assess clinical outcome before and after surgery, at the final follow-up. The Visual Analogue Scale and Oswestry Disability Index were used for pain and functional assessment. In all cases, preoperative and postoperative radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging were obtained. RESULTS: The average time of surgery was 88 min (75-115 min). The mean blood loss was 10 ml (6-12 ml) during surgery. The anterior height loss of vertebral body decreased significantly from 79.3 +/- 11% before surgery to 8.0 +/- 5.2% after surgery, and 7.6 +/- 6.0% at the final follow-up. The spinal canal encroachment significantly reduced from 19.9 +/- 2.6 % preoperatively to 4.0 +/- 0.7% postoperatively, 4.1 +/- 0.7% at the final follow-up. The Cobb angle was corrected from 25.8 +/- 7.9 degrees primarily to 8.2 +/- 4.1 degrees postoperatively, 7.8 +/- 3.1 degrees at the final follow-up.

Although infrequent, both transitory and persistent adverse effects have been reported. They range from asymptomatic to severe neurological deficits that are caused directly by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) leakage or may be related to local or general reactions not due to PMMA leakage. Transitory hypotension after the procedure has been observed, but the characteristics and etiology of this phenomenon are not defined. OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of prolonged hypotension after kyphoplasty and suggest a possible mechanism. METHODS: Six months after L2 kyphoplasty, a 63-year-old woman with severe osteoporosis developed a new back pain due to compression fracture of L1 and compression deformity of the superior L3 endplate. The patient underwent bilateral kyphoplasty at the L1 and L3 levels. She developed persistent hypotension for approximately 46 hours immediately after the procedure. Common causes of hypotension were ruled out and the event resolved spontaneously. RESULTS: On the basis of needle placement, the temporal relationship between the procedure and blood pressure change, and the lack of other identifiable causes, thermal sympathectomy from heating of the PMMA adjacent to the paravertebral sympathetic chain is proposed as a potential mechanism. LIMITATIONS: Single case report based on clinical observation. DISCUSSION: Prolonged hypotension can complicate kyphoplasty at upper lumbar levels. Two days of severe hypotension has not been described as a complication of kyphoplasty. Although the mechanism is unknown, a transient thermal sympathectomy may be the cause.",eng,0.0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 77 consecutive patients with thoracic and lumbar spine fractures treated from 2000 to 2011; 28 patients experienced high-energy spinal trauma and 49 low-energy spinal trauma. Mean follow-up was 5 years (1-11 years). Surgical treatment was done in 15 patients with neurological deficits, and in 16 neurologically intact patients with fractures-dislocations, burst fractures and fractures with marked deformity. Non-surgical treatment was done in 46 neurologically intact patients with simple fracture configurations. Clinical and imaging examination and the Oswestry Disability Index (O.D.I.) questionnaire were obtained. RESULTS: All patients treated surgically maintained spinal alignment; patients with long fusion maintained the best alignment; however, they experienced back stiffness and moderate low back pain. Patients with combined posterior fusion and kyphoplasty experienced earlier recovery and improved sagittal correction. Mean O.D.I. was 22.4 and 14.2% at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Thirty six (78%) patients treated non-surgically were asymptomatic, 22 (48%) experienced mild residual kyphosis, 10 (22 %) developed marked deformity during their follow-up and were finally operated; mean O.D.I. was 28.6 and 12.1% at 3 and 12 months. No difference in O.D.I. was observed between patients who had surgical and non-surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive neurological deficits and/or mechanical instability of the spine are absolute indications for early surgical treatment. Younger patients with high-energy spinal trauma, unstable fractures and neurological deficits should be treated surgically in order to provide optimum conditions for neurologic recovery, early mobilization and possibly ambulation. Most cases can be adequately operated through a posterior only surgical approach; an anterior or combined approach is usually indicated for burst and thoracic spine fractures. Postoperative complications, more common infection and neurological deterioration may occur. Elderly, neurologically intact patients with low-energy, stable spinal fractures without marked spinal deformity may be successfully treated conservatively. Most of these patients will do well; however, follow-up for progressive posttraumatic deformity is required.",eng,0.0

There are few reported infectious complications requiring surgical management such as corpectomy with anterior reconstruction and posterior stabilization, although we have not seen any reports about epidural abscess in the literature. We present a patient in whom posterior epidural abscess developed after vertebroplasty in which drainage and antibiotherapy were required for treatment. METHODS: A 70-year-old female with a painful T12 osteoporotic compression fracture underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty using polymethylmethacrylate without complication. One week after vertebroplasty, however, she had fever and increased back pain. On clinical examination, soft tissue abscess formation was determined at the vertebroplasty site. This was drained surgically and antibiotic treatment was started. At follow-up, she had progressive neurological deterioration (paraparetic) on the 18th day after abscess drainage. MRI of the thoracolombar spine revealed posterior spinal epidural abscess at the T11/12 level. Partial laminectomy and drainage were performed. She had complete neurological recovery in the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: An epidural abscess, which is an unusual complication of vertebroplasty, represents a medical and surgical emergency. Treatment is generally urgent surgical drainage combined with antibiotics. The patient should be evaluated in detail for systemic infectious disease and comorbid conditions before the vertebroplasty procedure.",eng,1.0

MRI and particularly the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence are very sensitive for detecting vertebral edema as a result of fresh fractures or micro-fractures. Therefore, it has a great therapeutic relevance in differentiating vertebral deformities seen by conventional X-ray and CT scans. Although an MRI scan is expensive, to my knowledge no study has evaluated the benefits of preoperative MRI in evaluating a therapeutic plan for kyphoplasty. This is a prospective study evaluating the benefit of a preoperative MRI scan regarding changes of kyphoplasty therapy. Twenty-eight patients were included in this study. Twenty-four patients were treated by balloon kyphoplasty, in a total of 40 vertebral bodies. The mean age was 73 years. All patients suffered from OVCFs. As a first step, all patients got a CT scan. The individual therapeutic plan was then defined by the patients' history, complaints and the results of the CT scan. As far as all criteria for kyphoplasty were fulfilled, an MRI examination including the STIR sequences was performed preoperatively. The number of times a change was made in therapy as a result from the additional information from the MRI was then evaluated. By performing a preoperatively MRI examination, the therapy plan was changed in 16 out of 28 (57%) patients. Eight patients underwent additional levels of kyphoplasty at the same procedure. In five patients, lesions were found to be old fractures and therefore were not treated operatively. Two of these patients received no kyphoplasty at all. Another patient only a part of the originally intended levels was treated. The other two cases received a kyphoplasty at different vertebral levels, as these vertebral bodies showed signs of an acute fracture in the MRI scan. Additionally, an incidental diagnosis of carcinoma of the kidney was made in two patients. Kyphoplasty was deferred and they were referred for further evaluation. One patient was found to have an aortic aneurysm. Kyphoplasty was performed and after that the patient was referred in order to treat the aneurysm. This study confirms the diagnostic benefits of an MRI scan before performing a kyphoplasty. For 16 out of 28 patients, the therapeutic plan was changed because of the information obtained by preoperative MRI. Preoperative MRI helped to generate the correct surgical strategy, by demonstrating the correct location of injury and by detecting concomitant diseases.",eng,0.0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the years 2002 and 2003 5 patients with incomplete burst fractures (AO type A3.1) of the thoracolumbar spine were included in this study (4 men, 1 woman, average age: 62.6 years, follow-up rate: 100 %). All 5 were treated by kyphoplasty and additional dorsal bisegmental instrumentation. Unlike today, dorsal instrumentation was done without cement augmentation. Inclusion criteria were age above 60 years, an adequate trauma, and a fracture between thoracic body 11 and lumbar body 3. Data acquisition was performed prospectively before and after the operation, after 3, 6, 12, 18 months, and after 5 years, including visual analogue scale (VAS) spine score, spinal function score, X-ray examination or in cases of complaints or limited assessability a CT examination, and SF 36 score after 5 years. As comparison group, we used 4 patients, suffering the same fracture type with a similar fracture location (1 man, 3 women, average age: 67.3 years), who were treated with kyphoplasty alone during the same time period. RESULTS: No clinically relevant intra- and postoperative complications were registered in our study group. The operative bisegmental kyphotic reduction was slightly higher in our study group. Afterwards the correction loss was 9.8 degrees in our study group, exceeding the reduction by 3.6 degrees , whereas the comparison group suffered from a correction loss of 11.8 degrees , exceeding the operative reduction by 8.5 degrees , respectively. These differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, no statistically significant differences were registered with respect of physical component summary (PSC), mental component summary (MSC) score and VAS spine score. Both groups had comparable PSC and MSC scores to a norm group of the same age. CONCLUSION: After 5 years the therapy concept seems to be of low risk and not being associated with major complications. The PCS and MCS scores are comparable to a norm group of the same age. The correction loss exceeded the operative reduction marginally but turned out to be slightly lower compared to that of an isolated kyphoplasty.",ger,0.0

Josten,2016.0,[Delayed indications for additive ventral treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures : What correction loss is to be expected],10.1007/s00113-015-0056-1,"INTRODUCTION: There is a general consensus that unstable vertebral body fractures of the thoracolumbar junction with a B type fracture or a high load shear index need to be surgically stabilized, primarily by a dorsal approach. The authors believe that there are indications for an additional ventral spondylodesis in cases of reduction loss or a relevant intervertebral disc lesion in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 6 weeks after dorsal stabilization. However, in cases of unstable vertebral fractures it remains unclear if a delayed anterior spondylodesis will lead to unacceptable loss of initial reduction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 59 patients were included in this study during 2013 and 2014. All patients suffered from a traumatic vertebral fracture of the thoracolumbar junction and were initially treated with a dorsal short segment stabilization. All vertebral body fractures had a load shear index of at least 5 or were B type fractures. An x-ray control was carried out after 2 and 6 weeks and MRI was additionally performed after 6 weeks. An additional ventral spondylodesis was recommended in patients showing a reduction loss of at least 5 degrees and in patients with relevant intervertebral disc lesions. The extent of the reduction loss was analyzed. Other parameters of interest were the fracture level, fracture classification, patient age and surgical technique (e.g. implant, index screw, laminectomy and cement augmentation). RESULTS: The patient collective consisted of 23 women and 36 men (average age 51 years +/- 17 years). The mean reduction loss was 5.1 degrees (+/- 5.2 degrees ) after a mean follow-up of 60 days (+/- 56 days). The reduction loss was significantly higher when polyaxial implants were used compared to monoaxial dorsal fixators (10.8 degrees versus 4.0 degrees , p < 0.001). There was a significantly higher reduction loss in those patients who received a laminectomy (11.3 degrees versus 4.3 degrees , p = 0.01) but there were no significant differences if an index screw was used (4.5 degrees versus 5.3 degrees ). Additionally, there was a significantly lower reduction in the subgroup of patients 60 years or older who were stabilized using cement-augmented screws (3.9 degrees versus 11.3 degrees , p = 0.02). The mean reduction loss was 2.8 degrees (+/- 2.5 degrees ) in patients treated with a monoaxial implant, cement-augmented if 60 years or older and without laminectomy (n = 39). There was no significant correlation between reduction loss and the other parameters of interest, such as fracture morphology with classification according to the working group on questions of osteosynthesis (AO) and McCormack or fracture level. CONCLUSION: Delayed indications for an additional ventral spondylodesis in patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures and initial dorsal stabilization will cause no relevant reduction loss if monoaxial implants are used and laminectomy can be avoided. Additionally, cement augmentation of the pedicle screws seems to be beneficial in patients 60 years of age or older.",ger,0.0

Journal Article,J. M. Spivak; M. G. Johnson,2005.0,Percutaneous treatment of vertebral body pathology,", ","Percutaneous vertebral body injection procedures currently are used to stabilize and reinforce weakened or fractured bone resulting from metastatic disease and severe osteoporosis. Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can reinforce the structure of a vertebral body and provide pain relief, but the procedures have technical differences. Kyphoplasty improves vertebral height to varying degrees in nearly three quarters of patients. Kyphosis is improved more effectively when the procedure is performed within 3 months from the onset of fracture pain. To date, it is unknown whether vertebroplasty with preprocedure postural reduction can provide similar improvement of deformity. Complications are relatively infrequent with both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Cement leakage from the vertebral body is more likely with vertebroplasty than with kyphoplasty. Leakage is more common in the treatment of pathologic fractures resulting from metastatic disease. Clinical complications caused by cement leakage and neural compression are infrequent. Specific indications for these injection procedures need to be more clearly refined. Long-term outcomes, including the fate of the injected material and the effect on adjacent vertebrae, have yet to be determined.",eng,0.0

In the meantime, repeated reports on high rates of adjacent vertebral fractures (ASF) after BKP of vertebral insufficiency fractures were published. The causes for ASF and their risk factors are still under debate. The purpose of this study was to report the incidence and potential risk factors of ASF within the SSR dataset. METHODS: The SSR data points are collected perioperatively and during follow-ups, with surgeon- and patient-based information. All patients documented with a monosegmental osteoporotic vertebral insufficiency fracture between March 2005 and May 2012 were included in the study. The incidence of ASF, significant associations with co-variates (patient age, gender, fracture location, cement volume, preoperative segmental kyphosis, extent of kyphosis correction, and individual co-morbidities) and influence on quality of life (EQ-5D) and back pain (VAS) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 375 patients with a mean follow-up of 3.6 months was included. ASF were found in 9.9 % (n = 37) and occurred on average 2.8 months postoperatively. Preoperative segmental kyphosis >30 degrees (p = 0.026), and rheumatoid arthritis (p = 0.038) and cardiovascular disease (p = 0.047) were significantly associated with ASF. Furthermore, patients with ASF had significantly higher back pain at the final follow-up (p = 0.001). No further significant associations between the studied co-variates and ASF were seen in the adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that patients with a preoperative segmental kyphosis >30 degrees or patients with co-morbidities like rheumatoid arthritis and a cardiovascular disease are at high risk of ASF within 6 months after the index surgery. In case of an ASF event, back pain levels are significantly increased. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",eng,0.0

While no statistically significant between-group differences for new or progressed fracture risk at 12 and 24 months were observed, we observed a consistent trend towards higher risk of any type of fracture in the group undergoing VP. Our analysis was underpowered, and further adequately powered studies are needed to be able to draw firm conclusions about further vertebral risk with vertebroplasty. PURPOSE: This study seeks to assess the effect of VP on the risk of further radiologically apparent vertebral fracture within two years of the procedure. METHODS: We conducted a randomised placebo-controlled trial of VP in people with acute osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to VP (n = 38) or placebo (n = 40). Cement volume and leakage were recorded for the VP group. Plain thoracolumbar radiographs were taken at baseline, 12 and 24 months. Two independent radiologists assessed these for new and progressed fractures at the same, adjacent and non-adjacent levels. RESULTS: At 12 and 24 months, radiographs were available for 45 (58 %) and 47 (60 %) participants, respectively. There were no between-group differences for new or progressed fractures: 32 and 40 in the VP group after 12 and 24 months compared with 21 and 33 in the placebo group (hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 3.94). Similar results were seen when considering only adjacent (HR (95 % CI) 2.30 (0.57 to 9.29)) and non-adjacent (HR (95 % CI) 1.45 (0.55 to 3.81) levels. In all comparisons, there was a consistent trend towards higher risk of any type of fracture in the group undergoing VP. Within the VP group, fracture risk was unrelated to total (HR (95 % CI) 0.91 (0.71 to 1.17)) or relative (HR (95 % CI) 1.31 (0.15 to 11.48)) cement volume or cement leakage (HR (95 % CI) 1.20 (0.63 to 2.31)). CONCLUSION: For patients undergoing VP, our study did not demonstrate significant increases in subsequent fracture risk beyond that experienced by those with vertebral fractures who did not undergo the procedure. However, because of the non-significant numerical increases observed, studies with adequate power are needed to draw definite conclusions about fracture risk.",eng,1.0

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of combined individual patient level data. SETTING: Two multicentred randomised controlled trials of vertebroplasty; one based in Australia, the other in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 209 participants (Australian trial n = 78, US trial n = 131) with at least one radiographically confirmed vertebral compression fracture. 57 (27%) participants had pain of recent onset (vertebroplasty n = 25, placebo n = 32) and 99 (47%) had severe pain at baseline (vertebroplasty n = 50, placebo n = 49). INTERVENTION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty versus a placebo procedure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Scores for pain (0-10 scale) and function (modified, 23 item Roland-Morris disability questionnaire) at one month.

At one month those in the vertebroplasty group were more likely to be using opioids. CONCLUSIONS: Individual patient data meta-analysis from two blinded trials of vertebroplasty, powered for subgroup analyses, failed to show an advantage of vertebroplasty over placebo for participants with recent onset fracture or severe pain.

OBJECTIVE: To study vertebral strength in relation to cement augmentation technique after vertebroplasty and to assess the influence of the biomechanical compression model on postoperative results. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures, the role of vertebroplasty has been well established. Biomechanical compression models thus far used, compressing vertebrae by only 25% of their initial height, did not show a correlation between cement augmentation volumes and postoperative compression strength. In these studies, even very small volumes of cement seem effective. However, these models may not realistically simulate clinically relevant osteoporotic wedge fractures. We hypothesize that, in clinically relevant osteoporotic wedge fractures, postoperative vertebral body strength is strongly dependent on endplate-to-endplate cement augmentation. METHODS: Twenty-five intact osteoporotic cadaver vertebrae were obtained (10 lumbar, 15 thoracic). In 21 vertebrae, anterior wedge fractures (AO type A1.2) were created by controlled external force, with preset height reduction by 35%. After height reconstruction, 9 vertebrae were augmented endplate-to-endplate and 12 vertebrae were partially augmented with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Another 4 vertebrae were compressed by only 25%. Posttreatment strength and stiffness of the vertebrae were determined by a compression test identical to the pretreatment compression protocol. RESULTS: In the 35% compression group, posttreatment strength was significantly decreased in vertebrae that were partially augmented with cement compared with the endplate-to-endplate augmented group (767 +/- 257 N vs. 1141 +/- 325 N, P < 0.01). Postoperative strength amounted 106% +/- 27% of preoperative strength values in the endplate-to-endplate augmented vertebrae, compared with 65% +/- 18% in the partially augmented vertebrae (P < 0.001). In the 25% compression group, results in height restored and augmented vertebrae were similar to the nontreated vertebrae. CONCLUSIONS: Endplate-to-endplate PMMA augmentation restores the biomechanical properties of vertebrae in clinically relevant anterior wedge fractures. Our preliminary data suggest that biomechanical models with only 25% compressive deformation unlikely form a good model to assess the mechanical effects of cement augmentation in osteoporotic fractures.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,J. Steinmann; C. T. Tingey; G. Cruz; Q. Dai,2005.0,Biomechanical comparison of unipedicular versus bipedicular kyphoplasty,", ","STUDY DESIGN: A cadaveric study comparing the biomechanics of unipedicular versus bipedicular kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to compare unipedicular kyphoplasty to bipedicular kyphoplasty in restoring strength, stiffness, and height to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and to study the degree of unilateral wedging when using a unipedicular versus bipedicular approach to kyphoplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a common ailment of the elderly that can lead to chronic pain and deformity. Recently developed treatments known as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty provide pain relief by percutaneously augmenting the fractured vertebral body with polymethyl methacrylate via a transpedicular approach. Vertebroplasty via a unipedicular approach has been shown to provide comparable restoration of vertebral body stiffness when compared to a bipedicular approach. The anticipated benefits of a unipedicular approach include reduction in patient risk, operative time, radiation exposure, and cost. No studies have evaluated the efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two fresh-frozen human cadaveric spines (T3-L5) were disarticulated, and the vertebral bodies (n = 30) were compressed using an Instron 8521 machine, recording load versus displacement. The fractured vertebral bodies then underwent kyphoplasty via either a unipedicular or bipedicular approach. The augmented vertebral bodies were then recompressed. The strength, stiffness, and height restoration of the groups were compared. Following recompression, the risk for lateral wedging was evaluated by comparing lateral height measurements. RESULTS: Following fracture and subsequent kyphoplasty augmentation, the mean strength of the bipedicular group was 1.40 kN (+/- 0.38) versus 1.57 kN (+/- 0.55) in the unipedicular group. Average stiffness in the bipedicular group was 0.4387 kN/mm (+/- 0.2095) compared to 0.6880 kN/mm (+/- 0.3179) in the unipedicular group. Postcompression vertebral body height was restored to 96% of prefracture height in the bipedicular group and 94% of prefracture height in the unipedicular group. The mean absolute value of the difference in height between right and left side of the vertebral bodies was 1.06 mm (+/- 1.01) in the bipedicular group, whereas the unipedicular group had a mean of 1.78 mm (+/- 1.84). Statistical analysis using 1-way analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in any of the outcome measurements between the unipedicular and bipedicular groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Unipedicular kyphoplasty is comparable to bipedicular kyphoplasty in the restoration of vertebral body strength, stiffness, and height in experimentally induced vertebral compression fractures. There was no greater risk for lateral wedging in the unipedicular group compared to the bipedicular group. Given the advantages of a unipedicular approach with respect to vertebral pedicle cannulation risk, operative time, radiation exposure, and cost, this study would support the use of a unipedicular approach to kyphoplasty in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures.",eng,0.0

Malamis,2016.0,Percutaneous Minimally Invasive Techniques in the Treatment of Spinal Metastases,10.1007/s11864-016-0433-1,"OPINION STATEMENT: Spinal metastases are a common and morbid condition in America. Of the 1.6 million new cases of cancer estimated to be diagnosed in the USA in 2015, approximately 5-10 % will develop spinal metastases. This number is expected to increase as the life expectancy of cancer patients increases. Patients with osteolytic spinal metastases experience severe and often debilitating pain, which significantly reduces quality of life. Due to the morbidity of open surgery, particularly in oncologic patients, the treatment paradigm has shifted towards minimally invasive therapy. The advent and evolution of percutaneous treatments of spinal metastases has shown progressive success in reducing pain, improving function, and providing mechanical stability. There are various currently available interventions including vertebroplasty, vertebral augmentation, and coblation and radiofrequency ablation systems. For more complex spinal metastases, combined treatments including vertebral augmentation in conjunction with radiofrequency ablation, external beam radiation, and the novel treatment of intraoperative radiotherapy are also available. Ultimately, the goal of treatment in this patient population is palliative with the intention of improving the remaining quality of life. There is no established algorithm or specific technique that has proved best for the many variations of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), so treatment tends to be dependent on the operator and/or based on institution preference or bias. Each technique provides its own unique value in the various types of metastatic VCFs encountered, and understanding the uses, advantages, and safety profile of each specific treatment is imperative in providing the best patient care. Percutaneous treatment of metastatic spinal disease is an excellent alternative to medical and surgical management in carefully selected patients. We believe that a multidisciplinary approach and combination therapy allows for optimal pain reduction and improvement of function.",eng,1.0

Rees,2014.0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty and percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis,10.3310/hta18170,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure in which bone cement is injected into a fractured vertebra. Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a variation of this approach, in which an inflatable balloon tamp is placed in the collapsed vertebra prior to cement injection. OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate and appraise the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PVP and percutaneous BKP in reducing pain and disability in people with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) in England and Wales. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was carried out. Ten databases including MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from inception to November 2011, and supplemented by hand-searching relevant articles and contact with an expert. Studies met the inclusion criteria if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with painful osteoporotic VCFs with a group receiving PVP or BKP. In addition, lead authors of identified RCTs were contacted for unpublished data. REVIEW METHODS: Primary outcomes were health-related quality of life; back-specific functional status/mobility; pain/analgesic use; vertebral body height and angular deformity; incidence of new vertebral fractures and progression of treated fracture. A manufacturer provided academic-in-confidence observational data indicating that vertebral augmentation may be associated with a beneficial mortality effect, and that, potentially, BKP was more efficacious than PVP. These data were formally critiqued. A mathematical model was constructed to explore the cost-effectiveness of BKP, PVP and operative placebo with local anaesthesia (OPLA) compared with optimal pain management (OPM). Six scenario analyses were conducted that assessed combinations of assumptions on mortality (differential beneficial effects for BKP and PVP; equal beneficial effects for BKP and PVP; and no effect assumed) and derivation of utility data (either mapped from visual analogue scale pain score data produced by a network meta-analysis or using direct European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions data from the trials). Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted on each of the six scenarios. This report contains reference to confidential information provided as part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence appraisal process. This information has been removed from the report and the results, discussions and conclusions of the report do not include the confidential information. These sections are clearly marked in the report. RESULTS: A total of nine RCTs were identified and included in the review of clinical effectiveness. This body of literature was of variable quality, with the two double-blind, OPLA-controlled trials being at the least risk of bias. The most significant methodological issue among the remaining trials was lack of blinding for both study participants and outcome assessors. Broadly speaking, the literature suggests that both PVP and BKP provide substantially greater benefits than OPM in open-label trials. However, in double-blinded trials PVP was shown to have no more benefit than local anaesthetic; no trials of BKP compared with local anaesthesia have been conducted. A formal analysis of observational mortality data undertaken within this report concluded that it was not possible to say with certainty if there is a difference in mortality between patients undergoing BKP and PVP compared with OPM. Results from the cost-effectiveness analyses were varied, with all of BKP, PVP and OPLA appearing the most cost-effective treatment dependent on the assumptions made regarding mortality effects, utility, hospitalisation costs and OPLA costs. LIMITATIONS: Data on key parameters were uncertain and/or potentially confounded, making definitive conclusions difficult to make. CONCLUSION: For people with painful osteoporotic VCFs refractory to analgesic treatment, PVP and BKP perform significantly better in unblinded trials than OPM in terms of improving quality of life and reducing pain and disability. However, there is as yet no convincing evidence that either procedure performs better than OPLA. The uncertainty in the evidence base means that no definitive conclusion on the cost-effectiveness of PVP or BKP can be provided. Further research should focus on establishing whether or not BKP and PVP have a mortality advantage compared with OPLA and on whether or not these provide any utility gain compared with OPLA.

Cooper,2010.0,Cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty in patients with symptomatic vertebral compression fractures in a UK setting,10.1007/s00198-009-1096-6,"SUMMARY: Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a procedure used to treat vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). We developed a cost-effectiveness model to evaluate BKP in United Kingsdom patients with hospitalised VCFs and estimated the cost-effectiveness of BKP compared to non-surgical management. The results indicate that BKP provides a cost-effective alternative for treating these patients. INTRODUCTION: VCFs of osteoporotic patients are associated with chronic pain, a reduction in health-related quality of life (QoL) and high healthcare costs. BKP is a minimally invasive procedure that has resulted in pain relief, vertebral body height-restoration, decreased kyphosis and improved physical functioning in patients with symptomatic VCFs. BKP was shown to improve health-related QoL in a 12-month interim analysis of a randomised phase-III trial. METHODS: The objectives of this study were to develop a Markov cost-effectiveness model to evaluate BKP in patients with painful hospitalised VCFs and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of BKP compared with non-surgical management in a UK setting. It was assumed that QoL-benefits found at 12 months linearly approached zero during another 2 years, and that patients receiving BKP warranted six fewer hospital bed days compared with patients given non-surgical management. RESULTS: The procedure was associated with quality-adjusted life-years (QALY)-gains of 0.17 and cost/QALY-gains at 8,800 pound sterling. The results were sensitive to assumptions about avoided length of hospital-stay and persistence of kyphoplasty-related QoL-benefits. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the results indicate that BKP provides a cost-effective alternative for treating patients with hospitalised VCFs in a UK-setting.",eng,0.0

Tseng,2013.0,Comparison of the therapeutic effect of teriparatide with that of combined vertebroplasty with antiresorptive agents for the treatment of new-onset adjacent vertebral compression fracture after percutaneous vertebroplasty,10.1097/BSD.0b013e31823f6298,"STUDY DESIGN: Comparing a prospective group of 32 patients, who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and who were treated with teriparatide for at least 18 months after a new-onset adjacent vertebral compression fracture (VCF), and compared it with a retrospective group of 33 patients, who received antiresorptive agents combined with repeated PVPs for post-PVP new-onset adjacent VCFs. OBJECTIVE: This comparative study aimed to assess the immediate and mid-term efficacy and safety of teriparatide for treating new adjacent VCFs after vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty may provoke fractures in adjacent, nonaugmented vertebrae. Subsequent VCFs can occur much sooner and more frequently after PVPs. Antiresorptive agents do not effectively prevent new-onset VCFs or prompt pain relief. Treatment with teriparatide is effective and rapid in increasing spinal bone mineral density (BMD) and in decreasing vertebral fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis. METHODS: Relevant clinical data were compared between a prospective group of patients who received teriparatide and a retrospective group of patients who received antiresorptive agents and repeated PVPs for new-onset adjacent VCFs after PVP. RESULTS: Data in prospective group, including visual analogue scale scores and BMD were compared with those in a retrospective group. In group A, only 1 new-onset VCF occurred during the mean follow-up period of 22.56 months. In group B, 5 patients (6 vertebrae) developed new-onset VCFs after the second PVP, and 2 of these 5 patients had additional new VCFs after the third PVP. Teriparatide significantly reduced the risk of new VCFs after vertebroplasty (odds ratio=0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-1.64). The increase of lumbar spine BMD was 26.32% after 18 months of treatment with teriparatide and 4.62% after 18 months of treatment with antiresorptive agents. In addition, at the 18-month follow-up, mean visual analogue scale scores had decreased from 8.03+/-1.97-1.37+/-0.52 in the teriparatide group and from 7.91+/-1.95-4.23+/-1.21 in the antiresorptive group. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of new-onset adjacent VCF after PVPs, the therapeutic effects of teriparatide is better than that of the combined vertebroplasty and an antiresorptive agent in fracture prevention, BMD change, and sustained pain relief.",eng,1.0

Whether raloxifen treatment after vertebroplasty can reduce mortality is unclear in this group. To compare the effect of raloxifene and no osteoporosis treatment on the risk of mortality after vertebroplasty, we designed this study. METHODS: This was a retrospective study (January 2001 to December 2007). Follow-up for each participant was calculated as the time from inclusion in the study to the time of death, or to December 31(st), 2013, whichever occurred first. All of the patients underwent baseline bone density studies, and age and body mass index (kg/m(2)) were recorded. All associated medical diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and liver and renal disease were recorded. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine patients with vertebral fractures were enrolled, of whom 51 used raloxifene and 98 patients did not receive any anti-osteoporotic therapy. At the end of the follow-up period, 62 patients had died and 87 were still alive. The treated patients had a lower mortality rate than those who did not receive treatment (P = 0.001, HR = 3.845, 95% CI 1.884-7.845). The most common cause of mortality was sepsis, and those who received raloxifene had a lower rate of sepsis compared to those who did not receive treatment (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Effective treatment with raloxifene may had a lower mortality rate in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis-related vertebral fractures after vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

Anterior decompression and fusion alone for the treatment of vertebral collapse is not easy for patients with comorbid medical problems and severe bone fragility. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of one-stage posterior instrumentation surgery for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurological deficits. A consecutive series of 21 patients who sustained osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurological deficits were managed with posterior decompression and short-segmental pedicle screw instrumentation augmented with ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWP) cables with or without vertebroplasty using calcium phosphate cement. The mean follow-up was 42 months. All patients showed neurologic recovery. Segmental kyphotic angle at the instrumented level was significantly improved from an average preoperative kyphosis of 22.8-14.7 at a final follow-up. Spinal canal occupation was significantly reduced from an average before surgery of 40.4-19.1% at the final follow-up. Two patients experienced loosening of pedicle screws and three patients developed subsequent vertebral compression fractures within adjacent segments. However, these patients were effectively treated in a conservative fashion without any additional surgery.

Surgical intervention is usually recommended in osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurologic deficits. However, very few reports on surgical interventions exist. PURPOSE: To compare surgical results of anterior and posterior procedures for treating osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral collapse with sustained neurologic deficits. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective comparative study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Fifty patients who sustained osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral collapse with neurologic deficits were treated either by anterior decompression and strut graft (n=32) or by posterior decompression and pedicle screw fixation with vertebroplasty (n=18). OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of complications, sagittal Cobb angle, spinal canal encroachment, and Japanese Orthopedic Association score. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the results of a consecutive series of patients undergoing anterior decompression and strut graft or posterior decompression and pedicle screw fixation with vertebroplasty for osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral collapse with neurologic deficits. Operative notes, clinical charts, and radiographs were analyzed. RESULTS: Operative time was similar between the groups, but intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in the posterior group. All patients showed neurologic recovery. No significant difference was observed in the neurologic improvement, kyphosis correction angle, and loss of correction. Perioperative respiratory complications were found in 11 patients (34%) in the anterior group. In the anterior group, early posterior reinforcement was required in patients with very low bone density below 0.60 g/cm(2) and/or in those with three segments of instrumentation for two vertebral collapses. Posterior group patients did not undergo additional surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior reconstruction for osteoporotic vertebral collapse is significant because anterior elements, particularly those at the thoracolumbar junction, play a major role in load bearing. However, difficulties arise when anterior reconstruction is performed in cases with very low bone density and in those with multiple vertebral collapse.",eng,1.0

Sawada,2008.0,Diffusion-weighted imaging for predicting new compression fractures following percutaneous vertebroplasty,10.1080/02841850801886109,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a technique that structurally stabilizes a fractured vertebral body. However, some patients return to the hospital due to recurrent back pain following PVP, and such pain is sometimes caused by new compression fractures. PURPOSE: To investigate whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of adjacent vertebral bodies as assessed by diffusion-weighted imaging before PVP could predict the onset of new compression fractures following PVP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 25 patients with osteoporotic compression fractures who underwent PVP were enrolled in this study. ADC was measured for 49 vertebral bodies immediately above and below each vertebral body injected with bone cement before and after PVP. By measuring ADC for each adjacent vertebral body, ADC was compared between vertebral bodies with a new compression fracture within 1 month and those without new compression fractures. In addition, the mean ADC of adjacent vertebral bodies per patient was calculated. RESULTS: Mean preoperative ADC for the six adjacent vertebral bodies with new compression fractures was 0.55 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (range 0.36-1.01 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s), and for the 43 adjacent vertebral bodies without new compression fractures 0.20 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (range 0-0.98 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) (P < 0.001). Mean preoperative ADC for the six patients with new compression fractures was 0.55 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (range 0.21-1.01 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s), and that for the 19 patients without new compression fractures 0.17 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s (range 0.01-0.43 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) (P < 0.001).

Several authors reported that fixation of pedicle screws in severely osteoporotic bone could be improved by inserting polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) into the hole before inserting the screw. However, pedicle screws were not designed to be used with PMMA. PURPOSE: To report a patient with vertebral collapse who were treated using a novel-concept, pedicle nail using with PMMA. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: The patient was a 74-year-old female who experienced back pain after some heavy lifting 3 months before. She was laid up for 2 months because of the back pain and weakness of her lower legs. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging showed vertebral collapse and neural severe compression from the posterior wall of vertebra T12. The pedicle nail consists of an outer sheath with evenly spaced holes and an internal, removable, threaded component. The outer sheath and the internal component were connected before insertion. The pedicle nail attaches to and is bound by the PMMA through the holes of the outer sheath. We performed a T11-L1 posterior fusion and laminectomy using the pedicle nail, and we used a hydroxyapatite block to perform a transpedicular vertebroplasty of T12. RESULTS: Bone union was observed on a lateral radiograph without pedicle nail loosening. CONCLUSIONS: The authors speculate that posterior spinal fusion and vertebroplasty using the pedicle nail will be a reasonable choice for delayed paraplegia after osteoporotic vertebral fracture.",eng,0.0

The aim of this study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of a single balloon cross-midline expansion via unipedicular approach in kyphoplasty for OVCFs. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with painful OVCFs (61 vertebrae) were enrolled in this research. Unilateral transpedicular puncture was performed under the fluoroscopy monitoring of an oblique angle down the pedicle. A single balloon was introduced through unipedicular approach. The final balloon position was in the midline of the vertebral body with the balloon cross-midline expansion and bone cement filled. Clinical outcomes were determined by comparison of the preoperative and postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI). Radiographic assessment included restoration of vertebral height and correction of kyphosis. Follow-up was conducted for 6 - 12 months (mean 9.2 months). RESULTS: Thirty-six consecutive patients with 61 vertebrae were successfully operated on with a mean operation time of 37.4 minutes per vertebra. All patients had dramatic pain relief and functional recovery within 96 hours after the procedure with no surgery or device-related complications. VAS score improved from 7.27 +/- 1.02 preoperatively to 2.71 +/- 0.75 postoperatively (P < 0.01). ODI score was decreased from (71.14 +/- 10.94)% preoperatively to (26.56 +/- 6.35)% postoperatively. The average loss of anterior body height was (14.33 +/- 2.76) mm before procedure and (10.03 +/- 1.83) mm after procedure (P < 0.01), while the average loss of middle body height was (10.15 +/- 2.70) mm before procedure and (5.89 +/- 1.83) mm after procedure (P < 0.01). The kyphotic deformity was corrected from (23.43 +/- 5.00) degree to (16.16 +/- 2.77) degree (P < 0.01). The pain relief and functional recovery were substantial and maintained to the last follow-up without any re-collapse or adjacent level fracture.

Li,2014.0,Analysis of risk factors of subsequent fractures after vertebroplasty,10.1007/s00586-013-3110-0,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors related to the development of subsequent fractures after vertebroplasty. METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted to review 175 patients with a 1-year follow-up who underwent vertebroplasty for first-time and single-level osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Subsequent fractures were diagnosed as recurrent intractable back pain, post-operatively correlated with MR image. Clinical parameters, such as age, gender, baseline VAS-score, lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) T-score, history of use of steroids, bisphosphonate therapy, symptom-free interval, the amount of bone cement injected, vacuum clefts, leakage of cement into the disk space, treated level and the changes of spinal geometry were recorded. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, subsequent fractures developed in 37 (21.1 %) of 175 patients. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between the patients with subsequent fractures and the patients without subsequent fractures in regard to their BMD T-score, and treated vertebrae location. Average BMD T-score was -3.4 +/- 1.5 in patients with subsequent fractures and -2.9 +/- 1.6 in patients without subsequent fractures. The percentage of subsequent fractures was 13.9 % (10 of 72) for treated vertebrae located in non-thoracolumbar junction, and 26.2 % (27 of 103) in the thoracolumbar junction. CONCLUSION: The most important risk factors affecting subsequent fractures after vertebroplasty were osteoporosis and treated level at the thoracolumbar junction.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,G. Sun; L. J. Wang; P. Jin; X. W. Liu; M. Li,2013.0,Vertebroplasty for treatment of osteolytic metastases at C2 using an anterolateral approach,", ","BACKGROUND: The clinical management of osteolytic metastases involving C2 is unique, because it is challenging to approach these lesions. Symptoms may vary from local pain to progressive neurological deficit. Surgery or radiotherapy have been the treatments of choice for several years; however, surgery may not bean option for patients with multiple metastases and poor general medical status, and radiotherapy carries the risk of vertebral collapse and consequent neural compression due to delayed bone reconstruction. Through different approaches, vertebroplasty has been introduced into clinical practice as an alternative to traditional surgical and radiotherapy treatments of osteolytic metastases at C2. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vertebroplasty with an anterolateral approach for osteolytic metastases at C2 under fluoroscopic guidance. STUDY DESIGN: Vertebroplasty in 13 patients with osteolytic metastases at C2 and its clinical effects were evaluated. SETTING: This study was conducted in an interventional therapy group at a medical center in a major Chinese city. METHODS: Thirteen consecutive patients were treated with vertebroplasty via an anterolateral approach. The researchers followed up with the patients for 3 to 12 months, with an average of 9.2 months. The clinical effects were evaluated with the visual analog scale (VAS) pre-operatively and at 3 days, one month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-operatively. RESULTS: Thirteen consecutive patients were successfully treated with a satisfying resolution of painful symptoms. Extraosseous cement leakages were found in 5 cases without any clinical complications. VAS scores decreased from 7.6 +/- 0.9 pre-operatively to 2.1 +/- 1.9 by the 3-day post-operative time point, and were 1.8 +/- 1.7 at one month, 1.7 +/- 1.8 at 3 months, 0.9 +/- 0.8 at 6 months, and 0.6 +/- 0.5 at 12 months after the procedure. There was a significant difference between the mean pre-operative baseline score and the mean score at all of the post-operative follow-up points (P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: This was an observational study with a relatively small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty via an anterolateral approach is an effective technique to treat osteolytic metastases involving C2. It is a valuable, minimally invasive, and efficient method that allows quick and lasting resolution of painful symptoms.",eng,1.0

Zhong,2013.0,Novel biodegradable electrospun nanofibrous P(DLLA-CL) balloons for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures,10.1016/j.nano.2012.12.003,"UNLABELLED: Significant interest has been expressed by the spinal surgeon community for the use of calcium phosphate cement (CPC) in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), but the water-induced collapsibility and poor mechanical properties limit its clinical use. Here we fabricated novel electrospun nanofibrous P(DLLA-CL) balloons (ENPBs) using the nanotechnique of electrospinning. The ENPBs could separate the cements from the surrounding environment, and therefore can prevent the water-induced collapsibility of CPC and eliminate cement leakage. The ENPBs filling with CPC had enough load-bearing ability to restore the height of the fractured vertebral body and had no obvious effects on the initial strength and stiffness of natural bones. Further, the ENPBs had good biodegradability and cell proliferation ability. Calcium can be released from ENPBs filling with CPC. All these results strongly demonstrate ENPBs can be potentially used as CPC filling containers that keep the advantages and eliminate the disadvantages of CPC. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) is a promising modality in vertebral compression fracture treatment, but its water-induced collapsibility limits clinical applications. This team of investigators fabricated novel nanofibrous balloons using electrospinning, which enabled the separation of CPC from its surrounding environment, and therefore prevented water-induced collapsibility of CPC and eliminated cement leakage while maintaining all the advantages of CPC treatment.",eng,0.0

METHODS: From January 2009 to January 2012,18 patients with thoracolumbar fractures without neurological symptoms were treated with short-segment transpedicular fixation and vertebroplasty via paraspinal intermuscular approach. There were 11 males and 7 females, aged from 52 to 76 years old with an average of 62.2 years. The duration from injuries to surgery ranged from 8 h to 7 d with an average of 4.2 d. According to the Denis fracture classification, 12 cases got compression fractures and 6 cases got burst fractures. LOCATION: 6 vertebra with T12, 9 with L1, 6 with L2, and 3 with L3. Anterior vertebral body height, the sagittal Cobb angle, the sagittal index (SI), condition of internal fixation failure and recurrent kyphosis were observed. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 12-28 months with an average of 16.5 months. Operation time was from 80 to 130 min with a mean of 95 min and bleeding volume during operation ranged from 100 to 180 ml with a mean of 145 ml. Anterior vertebral body height ratios preoperation, 3 days after operation and final follow-up was 54.3 +/- 2.8, 90.9 +/- 1.5, 88.6 +/- 1.7, respectively; sagittal Cobb angle was (27.8 +/- 2.5) degrees, (5.3 +/- 0.8) degrees, (6.3 +/- 1.4) degrees, respectively; sagittal index was 52.3 +/- 3.8, 89.2 +/- 5.2, 86.4 +/- 4.5, respectively. Data obtained 3 days after operation obviously improved than preoperation, and there was no statistically significant difference between 3 days after operation and last follow-up. No internal fixation failure, neurological complications and recurrent kyphosis were found. CONCLUSION: Treatment of thoracolumbar fractures with short-segment transpediclar screw fixation and vertebroplasty via paraspinal intermuscular approach can retain the posterior ligament complex and restore the mechanical strength of the anterocentral column,which proved an ideal method for preventing the failure of internal fixation and reduction of post-traumatic segmental kyphosis.",chi,0.0

Li,2016.0,Comparison of unilateral and bilateral percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1186/s13018-016-0479-6,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the safety and effectiveness of unilateral percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) compared with that of bilateral treatment. METHODS: The multiple databases including PubMed, Springer, EMBASE, OVID, and China Journal Full-text Database were adopted to search for relevant studies in English or Chinese, and full-text articles involving comparison of unilateral and bilateral PVP surgery were reviewed. Review Manager 5.0 was adopted to estimate the effects of the results among selected articles. Forest plots, sensitivity analysis, and bias analysis for the articles included were also conducted. RESULTS: Finally, 1043 patients were included in the 14 studies, which eventually satisfied the eligibility criteria, and unilateral and bilateral surgeries were 550 and 493, respectively. The meta-analysis suggested that there was no significant difference of VAS score, ODI score, and cement leakage rate (MD = 0.12, 95%CI [-0.03, 0.26], P = 0.11; MD = -1.28, 95%CI [-3.59, 1.04], P = 0.28; RR = 0.89, 95%CI [0.61, 1.29], P = 0.52). The surgery time of unilateral PVP is much less than that of bilateral PVP (MD = -16.67, 95%CI [-19.22, -14.12], P < 0.00001). Patients with bilateral PVP surgery have been injected more cement than patients with unilateral PVP surgery (MD = -1.55, 95%CI [-1.94, -1.16], P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Both punctures provide excellent pain relief and improvement of life quality. We still encourage the use of the unipedicular approach as the preferred surgical technique for treatment of OVCFs due to less operation time, limited X-ray exposure, and minimal cement introduction and extravasation.",eng,0.0

Yang,2016.0,Can Unilateral Kyphoplasty Replace Bilateral Kyphoplasty in Treatment of Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fractures? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,", ","BACKGROUND: Kyphoplasty has been proven to be an efficient method to relieve patient suffering from osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Because of its technological superiority, unilateral kyphoplasty consumes less operative time and bone cement than traditional bilateral kyphoplasty. However, there is controversy about which method is most efficient in the treatment of OVCFs. Thus, an overall analysis should be performed to shed light on the facts corroborating both procedures. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of unipedicular kyphoplasty versus bipedicular kyphoplasty in treating OVCFs. STUDY DESIGN: Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials focusing on comparing unilateral versus bilateral balloon kyphoplasty in treatment of OVCFs. The exclusion criteria contained infection, neoplastic etiology, traumatic fracture, neural compression, neurological deficit, spinal stenosis, previous surgery at the involved vertebral body, long-term use of steroids, and kyphoplasty with other invasive or semi-invasive intervention treatment. Retrospective studies, reviews, technology introductions, and biochemical trials were also excluded. SETTINGS: The PubMed MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE were systematic searched. Only randomized controlled trials published up to June 2015 comparing unilateral kyphoplasty with bilateral kyphoplasty in treatment of OVCFs were identified. METHODS: Two researchers independently screeded the works for inclusion and data extraction. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the methodological quality and evidence synthesis. RESULTS: Six articles with 563 patients were enrolled in this study. Results showed that the unilateral approach required less surgical time (MD, -23.19; 95% CI, [-27.08, -19.31]; P < 0.00001) and cement consumption (MD, -2.07; 95% CI, [-2.23, -1.91]; P < 0.00001), as well as a reduced cement leakage ratio (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, [0.35, 0.99]; P < 0.05) and improved short-term general health (MD, 1.48; 95% CI, [0.02, 2.93], P < 0.05). No significant difference was found in the visual analog scale score (short-term and long-term), Oswestry Disability Index score (mid-term and long-term) kyphotic angle reduction, restoration rate of anterior vertebral height, vertebral height loss rate, postoperative adjacent-level fractures, or in other assessments of 36-Item Short Form Health Survey parameters (short-term and long-term). LIMITATIONS: Only 6 studies were included, so that the sample size was still relatively small and publication bias could not be revealed in this study. Observation time of some data was inconsistent. All of these problems could influence the reliability of the results. CONCLUSION: Both unilateral kyphoplasty and bilateral kyphoplasty are safe and effective treatments for OVCFs. However, when operative time, cement volume, cement leakage, short-term general health, radiation dose, and hospitalization costs are taken into consideration, unilateral kyphoplasty may be the better choice. Yet, more high-quality RCTs with long-term follow-up are still required to make the final conclusion.Key words: Kyphoplasty, unilateral approach, bilateral approach, osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, meta-analysis.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To describe a rare cluster phenomenon of spontaneous vertebral refractures in a patient with glucocorticosteroid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) subsequent to percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for the management of initial vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PVP has become the popular strategy for stabilizing osteoporotic VCFs and obtaining rapid pain alleviation and earlier restoration of mobility in both patients with primary osteoporosis and patients with glucocorticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. However, current data are insufficient to recommend routine use of PVP for VCFs caused by GIOP as recent retrospective studies indicate that the risk of vertebral refractures is much higher in patients with GIOP than those with primary osteoporosis. METHODS: We reported a 63-year-old Chinese female with GIOP as well as pulmonary infection who underwent PVP for the management of initial VCFs, experienced the cluster phenomenon of spontaneous vertebral refractures. RESULTS: Within a 4-month period, she underwent a total of 6 PVP operations with 13 cement-augmented vertebral bodies from T5-L5. Eleven refractures after the initial PVP procedures included 3 remote-level fractures, 4 adjacent-level fractures, 1 pincher body fracture, and 3 fractures in previously augmented bodies. The average interval between each PVP operation was 23.6 days. CONCLUSION: The use of PVP as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of VCFs in patients with GIOP is still controversial. As seen in our case, even when the management decisions were made in consideration of the patient's pulmonary infection, the outcome was disastrous with the cluster phenomenon of vertebral refractures. Current findings suggest a compelling need for high-quality studies investigating cement augmentation procedures in patients with VCF with GIOP.",eng,1.0

METHODS: The treated vertebrae bodies were divided into four groups: group A, non-posterior vertebral wall defect; group B, posterior vertebral wall with cribriform defects; group C, posterior vertebral wall with local fragmentation defects; group D, posterior vertebral wall with severe defects. The injected volume of bone cement, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), cement leakage and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: The injected volume of bone cement for group A was significantly higher than posterior wall defect group (including group B, C, and D). No significant differences about the injected volume of bone cement among the posterior wall defect groups. The incidence of bone cement leakage for group A was not significantly different as compared to posterior vertebral wall defect group. However, there were significant differences with respect to the incidence of bone cement leakage among the posterior wall defect groups. In four groups the postoperative VAS pain scores and KPS were statistical different as comparison to the preoperative values. No statistical difference with respect to the VAS pain scores and KPS was observed at any time point between the non-posterior wall defect group and posterior wall defect group. CONCLUSION: PVP can be an effective treatment for metastatic spinal tumors in patients with posterior wall deficiency; however, care should be taken to control the distribution of the bone cement due to the relatively high risk of cement leakage.",eng,1.0

METHODS: In the study, 570 cases who received PVP or PKP as treatments of VCF from January 2010 to December 2013 were retrospective reviewed, of which 42 were GIOP and 21 were followed up as GIOP group, and the other 528 were primary osteoporosis and 391 were followed up, of which 84 were selected as Control group based on age and gender. The fracture location, ratio of single segment fracture and multiple segments fracture in the two groups were compared. In the final follow up, the reoperation rates for vertebral refractures by the Kaplan-Meier method in the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The follow up periods were (24.0+/- 13.1) months in GIOP group and (25.8+/-14.4) months in control group(P>0.05). In GIOP group, there were 11 cases with one-segment fracture, 2 with two-segments fracture, 3 with three-segments fracture, 2 with four-segments fracture, 2 with five-segments fracture and 1 with eight-segments fracture. In Control group, there were 67 cases with one-segment fracture, 12 with two-segments fracture, 3 with three-segment fracture, and 2 with four-segments fracture. The ratio of single segment fracture in GIOP group was significantly lower than that in Control group(52.4% vs. 79.8%,P=0.01). There were 50 fracture segments in GIOP group and 109 fracture segments in Control group. The ratios of fracture segments located in thoracic segments(T1-T10), thoracolumbar segments(T11-L1)and lumbar segments(L2-L5)were 18%, 46% and 36% in GIOP group and 11.9%, 58.7% and 29.4% in Control group (P>0.05). The refracture rate in GIOP group was higher than that in control group (23.8% vs. 6.0%). The survival rate was lower in GIOP group than that in control group (P<0.01).

Journal Article,K. Sun; M. A. Liebschner,2004.0,Biomechanics of prophylactic vertebral reinforcement,", ","STUDY DESIGN: The effects of bone cement placement, volume, and bone density on the degree of biomechanical reinforcement on cadaveric vertebral bodies were studied using experimentally calibrated detailed finite element models. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of prophylactic vertebroplasty on intact vertebral bodies with respect to biomechanical recovery and fracture risk reduction. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is a potentially effective fracture prevention treatment, but the risk of complications due to cement leakage must be minimized. Therefore, the least amount of bone cement required to improve vertebral strengths to low fracture risk levels need to be determined. METHODS: Six different polymethyl methacrylate volumes--1, 2.5, 3.5, 5, 7.5 and 9 cm--were virtually implanted into previously validated vertebral body finite element models, following bipedicular and posterolateral vertebroplasty approaches. Stiffness and fracture load of the treated and untreated vertebral body models under uniaxial compression were determined. RESULTS: Greater augmentation effects were observed for vertebral bodies with average quantitative computed tomography densities below 0.1 g/cm injected with polymethyl methacrylate volumes higher than 20% compared to lower injection volumes and higher bone densities, as well as for the bipedicular approach versus posterolateral. Vertebral bodies at high risk of fracture required at least 20% fill of polymethyl methacrylate to improve the mechanical integrity of vertebral bodies to low fracture risk levels, whereas 5% to 15% polymethyl methacrylate volumes were needed for the medium-risk vertebral bodies. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic vertebroplasty can be effective in reducing fracture risk. However, for the polymethyl methacrylate volume (20%) required for the successful reinforcement of high-risk vertebral bodies, the risk of complications will be as high as that for current vertebroplasty procedure for fracture repair. Therefore, alternative materials have to be investigated for prophylactic vertebroplasty. Furthermore, bipedicular vertebroplasty is the recommended approach due to its higher strengthening effect and easier surgical access than the posterolateral case.",eng,1.0
Journal Article,K. Sun; M. A. Liebschner,2004.0,Evolution of vertebroplasty: a biomechanical perspective,", ","This paper is a collection of computational, finite element studies on vertebroplasty performed in our laboratory, which attempts to provide new biomechanical evidence and a fresh perspective into how the procedure can be implemented more effectively toward the goal of preventing osteoporosis-related fractures. The percutaneous application of a bone cement to vertebral defects associated with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture has proven clinical successful in alleviating back pain. When the biomechanical efficacy of the procedure was examined, however, vertebroplasty was found to be limited in its ability to provide sufficient augmentation to prevent further fractures without risking complications arising from cement extravasations. The procedure may instead be more efficient biomechanically as a prophylactic treatment, to mechanically reinforce osteoporotic vertebrae at risk for fracture. Patient selection for such intervention may be reliably achieved with the more accurate fracture risk assessments based on vertebral strength, predicted using geometrically detailed, specimen-specific finite element models, rather than on bone density alone. Optimal cement volume, placement, and material properties were also recommended. The future of vertebroplasty involving biodegradable augmentation material laced with osteogenic agents that upon release will stimulate new bone growth and increase bone mass was proposed.",eng,0.0

From June 2010 to August 2013, 98 cases of OVCFs were included in our study. Forty-six patients underwent high-viscosity PVP and 52 patients underwent low-viscosity PKP. The occurrence of cement leakage was observed. Pain relief and functional activity were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), respectively. Restoration of the vertebral body height and angle of kyphosis were assessed by comparing preoperative and postoperative measurements of the anterior heights, middle heights and the kyphotic angle of the fractured vertebra. Nine out of the 54 vertebra bodies and 11 out of the 60 vertebra bodies were observed to have cement leakage in the high-viscosity PVP and low-viscosity PKP groups, respectively. The rate of cement leakage, correction of anterior vertebral height and kyphotic angles showed no significant differences between the two groups (P>0.05). Low-viscosity PKP had significant advantage in terms of the restoration of middle vertebral height as compared with the high-viscosity PVP (P<0.05). Both groups showed significant improvements in pain relief and functional capacity status after surgery (P<0.05). It was concluded that high-viscosity PVP and low-viscosity PKP have similar clinical effects in terms of the rate of cement leakage, restoration of the anterior vertebral body height, changes of kyphotic angles, functional activity, and pain relief.

We evaluated the correlation between extent of polymethylmethacrylate cement and occurrence of post-vertebroplasty fractures in patients with osteoporosis. METHODS: Totally 162 adjacent vertebral bodies with no fracture at the time of vertebroplasty and the distribution of cement in corresponding treated vertebral bodies of 98 patients were included for the evaluation. Length of follow-up after vertebroplasty was 734 +/- 314 days (range, 366-1838 days). Based on proximity of bone cement to the adjacent vertebral body, cement extent was classified as disc level (the closest), endplate level, or trabecula level (the farthest). RESULTS: Forty-one adjacent vertebrae had post-vertebroplasty fracture occurring 2-1038 days after vertebroplasty. The percentages of adjacent vertebral bodies having post-vertebroplasty fracture about cement extent were: disc level, 44; endplate level, 29; and trabecula level, 7.

Yang,2017.0,Percutaneous Balloon Kyphoplasty in Treatment of Painful Osteoporotic Occult Vertebral Fracture: A Retrospective Study of 89 Cases,", ","BACKGROUND The definition of a vertebral fracture is usually based on the presence of a deformation of the vertebral body and this can be misleading in the presence of a fracture without radiologic collapse with the definition of occult osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OOVFs). STIR sequence of MRI images showing hyperintensity signal was the most confirmative screening examination used to determine the presence of painful OOVFs. To date, clinical management of OOVFs has been rarely discussed. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 2011 and 2013, 89 patients suffering from painful OOVFs underwent 142 percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PKP) procedures. Outcome data (mean variation of anterior and middle vertebral body height, visual analog scale [VAS] scores, Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] scores, and SF-36 scores) were recorded preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 1 month, 6 months, and 2 year after treatment, to evaluate the results. RESULTS We successfully treated 89 patients (142 vertebral bodies) with PKP. Cement leakages were observed in 12 (8.45%) treated vertebral bodies and there were 5 new adjacent vertebral fractures during the follow-up period. The mean variation of anterior and middle vertebral body height changed from 96.5+/-3.4% preoperatively to 97.2+/-2.5% postoperatively (p>0.05) and from 96.3+/-2.8% preoperatively to 97.9+/-3.1% postoperatively (p>0.05), respectively. The mean VAS scores were reduced significantly from pre-surgery to post-surgery (8.3+/-1.2 to 2.9+/-0.7; p<0.05), as was the ODI score (76.4+/-12.5 to 26.7+/-5.6; p<0.05). The SF-36 scores, including Bodily Pain (BF), Vitality (VT), Physical Function (PF), and Social Functioning (SF), all showed notable improvement (P<0.05). These variations were maintained during the 2-year follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS PKP is a safe and effective method in the treatment of painful OOVFs.",eng,0.0

Journal Article,S. P. Suresh; R. W. Whitehouse,2005.0,Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty,", ","Vertebral compression fractures are common in elderly populations and in particular in postmenopausal women as a consequence of osteoporosis. Percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are minimally invasive procedures that are increasingly used to treat persistent or severe acute pain from these fractures. Vertebroplasty works by augmenting the weak osteopenic vertebrae with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement and thus preventing further microfractures and associated pain. The aim of kyphoplasty is pain relief combined with restoration of vertebral body height and reduction in kyphosis. This is achieved by 'expanding' the fractured vertebra with a balloon and then filling of the resultant cavity with PMMA cement. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are undertaken under local and general anaesthesia, respectively. Both procedures have a very low complication rate if properly performed by well trained clinicians using appropriate cement and technique and highquality imaging. Patient selection and the selection of the level at which the percutaneous vertebroplasty is to be done are of utmost importance for maximal therapeutic benefit. Additional trials are required to establish conclusively the effectiveness of both procedures compared with conservative medical therapy and each other.",eng,0.0

A cost-effectiveness model was constructed and used for analysis. Balloon kyphoplasty may be cost-effective compared to relevant alternatives. INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) for the treatment of patients hospitalised with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) compared to percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and nonsurgical management (NSM) in the UK. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was developed to evaluate treatment with BKP, NSM and PVP in patients with symptomatic OVCF. Data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with acute OVCF were derived from the FREE and VERTOS II randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and normalised to the NSM arm in the FREE trial. Estimated differences in mortality among the treatments and costs for NSM were obtained from the literature whereas procedure costs for BKP and PVP were obtained from three National Health Service hospitals. It was assumed that BKP and PVP reduced hospital length of stay by 6 days compared to NSM. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at Great Britain Pound Sterling (GBP) 2,706 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and GBP 15,982 per QALY compared to NSM and PVP, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of BKP vs. NSM was robust when mortality and HRQoL benefits with BKP were varied. The cost-effectiveness of BKP compared to PVP was particularly sensitive to changes in the mortality benefit. CONCLUSION: BKP may be a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of patients hospitalised with acute OVCF in the UK compared to NSM and PVP. Additional RCT data on the benefits of BKP and PVP compared to simulated sham surgery and further data on the mortality benefits with BKP compared to NSM and PVP would reduce uncertainty.",eng,0.0

The purpose of this study was to determine whether intervertebral disk extravasation is related to adjacent fracture formation in low-volume cement-filling vertebroplasty. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 308 patients having vertebroplasty was undertaken. Anteroposterior and lateral procedural fluoroscopy radiographs were analyzed for mild, moderate, or severe disk extravasation. Symptomatic refracture location relative to the presence or absence of extravasation was analyzed on follow-up fluoroscopy radiographs. RESULTS: Of the 308 patients in the study, 81 patients had disk extravasation at a total of 85 vertebral levels; 40 levels had mild extravasation, 38 levels had moderate extravasation, and 7 had severe extravasation. Of the 40 levels with mild extravasation, 6 new adjacent fractures occurred next to the disk leakage. Of the 38 with moderate extravasation, 6 new adjacent fractures occurred. Of the 7 levels of severe extravasation, only one new adjacent fracture occurred. Hence, a total of 13 adjacent fractures occurred next to disk extravasation; 13 nonadjacent fractures also occurred in the patients with disk extravasation. In the patients without disk extravasation, 28 adjacent and 24 nonadjacent subsequent fractures occurred. The average available cement volumes injected into vertebral bodies causing disk leakage ranged from 4.78 to 5.60 mL. CONCLUSIONS: With low-volume cement-filling percutaneous vertebroplasty, we cannot conclude (level of significance alpha = .05) that for patients who have a new fracture there is significance between the location of the fracture and the occurrence of disk extravasation.",eng,1.0

The purpose of this study was to analyze symptomatic refractures after vertebroplasty in patients on oral steroid therapy. We hypothesized that the higher refracture rate of patients on oral glucocorticoid therapy after percutaneous vertebroplasty is due not to an inadequacy of the procedure but rather to a naturally higher predisposition of these patients to refracture compared with patients with primary osteoporosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all osteoporosis patients having initial vertebroplasty from August 1999 to August 2003. The follow-up period was limited to 1 year after initial vertebroplasty session, with the last follow-up date ending in August 2004. Data were collected on 387 osteoporosis patients. RESULTS: Of the patients with primary osteoporosis, 20.6% patients refractured whereas 37.8% of the patients with steroid-induced osteoporosis had symptomatic refractures within 1 year of initial vertebroplasty. Relative risk of refracture within 1 year for the patients with steroid-induced osteoporosis was 1.84 compared with the patients with primary osteoporosis. In addition, the patients with steroid-induced osteoporosis were more likely to refracture after their second treatment session (within 1 year of initial vertebroplasty) than those with primary osteoporosis. CONCLUSION: Patients presenting on oral steroid therapy at their initial vertebroplasty are almost twice more likely to have symptomatic refractures than primary osteoporosis patients within 1 year of initial vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

METHODS: The amount of radiation administered to 30 patients during 41 procedures in a controlled prospective trial over 6 months was assessed, comparing radiation exposure to the right and left hands in two neurosurgeons. Effective skin doses were evaluated using thermoluminescent finger dosimeters (ring dosimeters). The ratios of finger dosimeter exposure were compared between the glove-protected and unprotected left hands of two surgeons and both unprotected right hands. In addition, dose-area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy times were recorded in all patients. The mean treatment-effective dose to the surgeons' hands was 0.49 +/- 0.4 mSv in the glove-protected left hand and 1.81 +/- 1.31 mSv in the unprotected left hand (p < 0.05). The mean effective hand doses were 0.59 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the glove-protected surgeon and 0.62 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the control surgeon. The total corresponding fluoroscopy time was 38.55 minutes for the protected surgeon and 41.23 minutes for the unprotected one (p > 0.05). Lead glove shielding resulted in a radiation dose reduction of 75%. The total DAP for all procedures was 256,496 mGy/cm2 and 221,408 mGy/cm2 (p > 0.05) for the protected and unprotected surgeons, respectively.

It is widely accepted that new compression fractures tend to occur adjacent to the vertebral bodies, typically within a month after PVP. To determine the risk factors among several potential predictors for de novo VFs following PVP in patients with osteoporosis. METHODS: We retrospectively screened the clinical results of 88 patients who had been treated by PVP. Fifteen cases were excluded due to non-union. Of the remaining 73 patients, 19 (26.0%) later returned with pain due to a new vertebral compression fracture. One patient with a non-adjacent fracture and 2 patients with adjacent factures occurring 3 months later were excluded from the study. The 9 male patients were excluded to avoid gender bias. Ultimately, we divided the 61 remaining postmenopausal female patients (mean age: 78.9 years) into the collapse group (14 patients) who had experienced adjacent vertebral collapse after PVP and the non-collapse group (47 patients) who had not. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for new VFs after PVP. RESULTS: All 14 cases of adjacent VF occurred within the first month after surgery. The collapse group had significantly advanced age, higher urinary N-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen, and lower lumbar and hip bone mineral density (BMD) scores as compared with the non-collapse group. The odds ratios for age, lumbar, total hip, femoral neck, and trochanteric BMD were 4.5, 8.2, 4.5, 7.2, and 9.6, respectively. Positive likelihood ratios suggested that age more than 85 years, lumbar BMD less than 0.700 [-2.6SD], total hip BMD less than 0.700 [-1.8SD], neck BMD less than 0.600 [-2.1], and trochanter BMD less than 0.600 conferred an elevated risk of adjacent VF.

We performed a procedure for the treatment of fresh thoracolumbar burst fractures by combining percutaneous short pedicle screw fixation and vertebroplasty with transpedicular intracorporeal hydroxyapatite blocks grafting. METHODS: Patients with type A3 fresh thoracolumbar burst fractures with no or mild neurological symptoms were treated using temporary posterior fixation without fusion. Consecutive 21 patients were studied, with a mean age of 45.4 years (range 23-73) and a mean follow-up period of 21.9 months (range 15-25). We evaluated operative time, estimated blood loss, low back pain on a visual analogue scale, change in the kyphotic angle, correction loss, bone union, and complications. RESULTS: The average operative time was 95.7 min (range 69-143), and the average blood loss was 38.6 mL (range 10-130). The average correction angle was 9.6 degrees . There were slight correction losses of height of the vertebral bodies. Bone union was obtained in all patients, with no instrumentation failures. Our procedure resulted in no surgery-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of type A3 fresh thoracolumbar burst fractures, this method is less invasive and can preserve the adjacent healthy mobile segment. Our treatment is an optional therapeutic strategy for patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures and is a good option particularly for young adult patients.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To report our early clinical experience using C-arm cone beam computed tomography (C-arm CBCT) with fluoroscopic overlay for needle guidance during vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: C-arm CBCT is advanced three-dimensional (3-D) imaging technology that is currently available on state-of-the-art flat panel based angiography systems. The imaging information provided by C-arm CBCT allows for the acquisition and reconstruction of CT-like"" images in flat panel based angiography/interventional suites. As part of the evolution of this technology, enhancements allowing the overlay of cross-sectional imaging information can now be integrated with real time fluoroscopy. We report our early clinical experience with C-arm CBCT with fluoroscopic overlay for needle guidance during vertebroplasty. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 10 consecutive oncology patients who underwent vertebroplasty of 13 vertebral levels using C-arm CBCT with fluoroscopic overlay for needle guidance from November 2007 to December 2008. Procedural data including vertebral level, approach (transpedicular vs. extrapedicular), access (bilateral vs. unilateral) and complications were recorded. Technical success with the overlay technology was assessed based on accuracy which consisted of 4 measured parameters: distance from target to needle tip, distance from planned path to needle tip, distance from midline to needle tip, and distance from the anterior 1/3 of the vertebral body to needle tip. Success within each parameter required that the distance between the needle tip and parameter being evaluated be no more than 5 mm on multiplanar CBCT or fluoroscopy. RESULTS: Imaging data for 12 vertebral levels was available for review. All vertebral levels were treated using unilateral access and 9 levels were treated with an extrapedicular approach. Technical success rates were 92% for both distance from planned path and distance from midline to final needle tip, 100% when distance from needle tip to the anterior 1/3 border of the vertebral body was measured, and 75% when distance from target to needle tip was measured. There were no major complications. Minor complications consisted of 3 cases (25%) of cement extravasation. CONCLUSION: C-arm CBCT with needle path overlay for fluoroscopic guided vertebroplasty is feasible and allows for reliable unilateral therapy of both lumbar and thoracic vertebral bodies. Extrapedicular approaches were performed safely and with good accuracy of reaching the targets.""",eng,0.0
Journal Article,J. Tamayo-Orozco; P. Arzac-Palumbo; H. Peon-Vidales; R. Mota-Bolfeta; F. Fuentes,1997.0,Vertebral fractures associated with osteoporosis: patient management,", ","With the growing interest in new treatments aimed at preventing bone loss and conserving bone mass, insufficient attention has been given to symptomatic treatment of patients with vertebral fractures. Patients often believe that the pain and impaired mobility associated with these fractures are permanent and that little can be done to help. This is a serious misconception. Prompt intervention using a multidisciplinary approach can hasten recovery from pain; improve mobility, flexibility, and speed of movement; and restore independence. Individualized care is needed because clinical features and degree of physical disability vary widely. Asymptomatic patients with vertebral fractures require evaluation and a management plan aimed at maintaining bone mass, improving functional status of the affected region, and preventing pain and new fractures. For patients with acute or chronic pain, treatment of pain and functional limitations is the first priority, followed by functional rehabilitation and preservation of bone mass. A multidisciplinary approach to long-term care is recommended and includes lifestyle re-education, physical therapy, physical fitness training, neurologic and orthopedic evaluation, and, for some patients, use of an orthosis. After 4-6 weeks, those patients for whom pain is persistent require detailed study to detect neurologic, myofascial, or orthopedic complications that can lead to chronic impairment of mobility. Vertebroplasty, surgery using different modalities, new exercise programs, and lifestyle modifications, together with more potent and effective medications to improve bone quality, are options to be used in the individual patient.

Walsh,2016.0,Effects of cement augmentation on the mechanical stability of multilevel spine after vertebral compression fracture,10.21037/jss.2016.06.05,"BACKGROUND: Studies on the effects of cement augmentation or vertebroplasty on multi-level spine after vertebral compression fractures are lacking. This paper seeks to establish a 3-vertebrae ovine model to determine the impact of compression fracture on spine biomechanics, and to discover if cement augmentation can restore mechanical stability to fractured spine. METHODS: Five lumbar spine segments (L1-L3) were obtained from 5-year-old female Merino sheep. Standardized wedge-compression fractures were generated in each L2 vertebra, and then augmented with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) cement mixed with 30% barium sulphate powder. Biomechanical pure moment testing in axial rotation (AR), flexion/extension (FE) and lateral bending (LB) was carried out in the intact, fractured and repaired states. Range of motion (ROM) and neutral zone (NZ) parameters were compared, and plain radiographs taken at every stage. RESULTS: Except for a significant increase in ROM between the intact and fractured states in AR between L1 and L2 (P<0.05), there were no other significant differences in ROM or NZ between the other groups. There was a trend towards an increase in ROM and NZ in all directions after fracture, but this did not reach significance. Normal biomechanics was only minimally restored after augmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that cement augmentation could not restore mechanical stability of fractured spine. Model-specific factors may have had a role in these findings. Caution should be exercised when applying these results to humans.",eng,1.0

Song,2015.0,A prospective study of percutaneous vertebroplasty for chronic painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture,", ","BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for patients with chronic painful osteoporotic compression fractures has not been extensively studied. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the efficacy of PVP for patients with chronic painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients with chronic painful osteoporotic VCFs for >/=3 months underwent PVP. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia. The outcomes were pain relief at one week, one month, three months, six months and one year, as measured by visual analogue scale, Oswestry Disability Index, Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores. RESULTS: The PVP procedures were technically successful and well tolerated in all patients. Sixty-two patients underwent PVP on 92 vertebrae in 73 procedures three to five days after referral, and no 30-day mortality was observed. Compared with baseline scores, improvement in visual analogue scale, Oswestry Disability Index, QUALEFFO and Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire scores was significantly greater after PVP at one week (P<0.001), one month (P<0.001), three months (P<0.001), six months (P<0.001) and one year (P<0.001), and the number of patients using drugs for pain treatment was significantly reduced. Five new fractures were reported in five of 62 patients treated with PVP during follow-up. CONCLUSION: PVP is effective in patients with chronic painful osteoporotic VCFs. Pain relief after PVP was immediate, was sustained for one year and may be an important factor for reducing persistent pain.",eng,1.0

Pain relief in malignant vertebral compression fractures is key to achieving a better quality of life in patients under palliative care. The gold standard for pain relief is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. Nonresponsive cases are then treated with radiotherapy, which may require 2-4 weeks to take effect and in most cases does not provide complete pain relief.

This article reports the clinical outcome of a series of 54 cases of osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebrae compression fractures treated by percutaneous kyphoplasty. Fifty-four patients with confirmed osteoporosis and at least 1 level of thoracolumbar vertebrae compression fracture were retrospectively selected. Pre- and postoperative and last follow-up clinical evaluation and radiological data were analyzed, including change of visual analog scale (VAS), reduced use of painkillers, locomotor activity, Cobb's angle, and average vertebral body height. Mean follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 6-36 months). In all cases, percutaneous kyphoplasty treatment was successful, significantly increasing vertebral body height, diminishing kyphosis in the fractured vertebrae, and decreasing painkiller use. In all patients, percutaneous kyphoplasty partially or completely relieved back pain. No new deformity was found within the follow-up period, nor were any other complications. The cement leakage rate was 3.86% (8 of 207 vertebrae) with percutaneous kyphoplasty, but no neurological or other complaints were received. Percutaneous kyphoplasty is a simple and safe procedure in managing osteoporotic vertebrae compression fractures.

METHODS: Twenty-three OVCFs patients with contraindications to MRI, diagnosed and treated in our hospital between December 2007 and November 2010, were enrolled in this retrospective study. There were 18 females and five males, aged from 57 to 87 years, with a mean age of 69.5 years. All patients underwent X-ray, CT scans examinations and bone scan to determine painful vertebrae. After the painful vertebra was defined, percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) was performed. Efficacy of PKP was assessed with visual analog (VAS) pain scale and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) preoperatively, postoperatively and during final follow-up assessments. RESULTS: The painful vertebrae shown on radiological films did not accord with those found based on bone scan imaging, with a high rate of incongruent findings (27.3%, 9/33). Radiological films showed 33 vertebrae with fractures, but only 26 vertebrae (22 patients) were selected as painful vertebrae for PKP based on bone scan imaging. There were statistically significant differences in mean VAS and ODI between the preoperative and the postoperative assessments; no significant differences were observed between postoperative and final follow-up assessments.

PURPOSE: To retrospectively investigate changes in respiratory function after PVP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 41 patients (mean age 72.0 years, range 59-86 years; 39 women, two men) who had undergone PVP for vertebral compression fractures (37 thoracic vertebral bodies [Th6-Th12] and 50 lumbar vertebral bodies [L1-L5]) caused by osteoporosis visited our hospital for follow-up consultation between January and June 2005. At this follow-up consultation, respiratory function testing, including percent forced vital capacity (FVC%) and percent forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)%), was performed. We retrospectively compared these values with those taken before PVP using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: FVC% was 85.2+/-30.3% before PVP and 91.5+/-16.8% at follow-up (mean 10 months after PVP), which represented a significant difference (P<0.003). No significant difference in FEV(1)% was detected. Regarding the number of treatment levels, that is, single vertebroplasty versus multiple vertebroplasty, no significant difference in improvement of FVC% was confirmed (P=0.1).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred ninety-four patients (168 women and 26 men; mean age, 73.3 years; range, 44-89 years) with 500 VCFs (T5-L5) were enrolled in this study. Evaluation at each follow-up time point (1 day, 1 month, 4 months, 1 year, and then once yearly) included pain response by using a pain visual analog scale (VAS) and frontal and lateral radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae regardless of the symptoms. RESULTS: The mean volume of cement injected was 3.3 mL (range, 0.5-12 mL) per level. Cement leakage was seen at 213 levels (42.6%). The mean follow-up time was 31 months (range, 1-97 months).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ninety-eight patients (87 women, 11 men; mean age, 74 years; age range, 60-90 years) with compression fractures of 75 thoracic (Th7-Th12) and 89 lumbar (L1-L5) vertebrae were enrolled in this study. Percentage vital capacity (VC%), percentage forced vital capacity (FVC%), and percentage forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV1) were measured using a spirometer before, 1 day after, and 1 month after percutaneous vertebroplasty. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate whether any significant differences in VC%, FVC%, or %FEV1 values existed between before, 1 day after, and 1 month after percutaneous vertebroplasty. RESULTS: The VC% and FVC% values had improved significantly by 1 month after percutaneous vertebroplasty compared with before percutaneous vertebroplasty (p<0.01). No significant difference was noted between values before and 1 day after percutaneous vertebroplasty. Likewise, no significant difference was identified in %FEV1 before percutaneous vertebroplasty and either 1 day or 1 month after percutaneous vertebroplasty. The mean degree of improvement in VC% values after percutaneous vertebroplasty for patients with one vertebra treated, which we refer to as the single-vertebroplasty"" group, and for patients with two or more vertebrae treated, or ""multiple-vertebroplasty"" group, was 1.1%+/-7% (SD) and 6.3%+/-8%, respectively, representing a significant difference between groups (p=0.01).

Patients were divided into three groups according to the proportion of the vertebra in which the bone marrow edema pattern was observed on sagittal MR images: group 1, 50% or more of the vertebra; group 2, less than 50%; group 3, no edema pattern observed. By using Wilcoxon rank sum test, Fisher exact test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test, groups were examined for differences in treatment efficacy, which was defined as the difference between preprocedural and postprocedural pain as assessed by means of visual analog scale (VAS) score at 1-3 days after PVP. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were assigned to group 1, 14 to group 2, and 22 to group 3.

In the patients with DISH, even a trivial vertebral fracture may actually turn out to be a three-column injury because mechanical stress is applied to the fracture site due to the lever arm effect. Under these circumstances, even a prolonged strict immobilization often results in failure. Recently, elderly people increasingly wish to maintain physical abilities. We present three patients aged over 90 years with DISH sustaining lower thoracic vertebral fracture after minor trauma. Long fusion involving three vertebral levels above and below the fracture site was performed with pedicle screw system, and vertebroplasty was carried out by transpedicular filling with hydroxyapatite blocks. The patients' activities of daily living were maintained close to the pre-injury level 1 year and 9 months, 2 years and 3 months, and 1 year after surgery, respectively. Many reports have recommended surgery over conservative treatments at vertebral fracture complicating DISH; however, there has been no report of vertebral fracture in patients aged over 90 years with DISH. Satisfactory results were obtained by surgical treatment in our three patients despite their age. We recommend posterior fusion with vertebroplasty just after injury for vertebral fracture in the elderly patients of advanced age with DISH to extend their healthy lifespan.",eng,0.0

Nowadays, radiotherapy for vertebral hemangiomas (VHs) is widely accepted as primary treatment for painful lesions. Nevertheless, the role of surgery is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel algorithm of treatment about VHs. This is a case report of an extensive VH and a review of the literature. A case of vertebral fracture during radiotherapy at a total dose of 30 Gy given in 10 fractions (treatment time 2 weeks) using a linear accelerator at 15 MV high-energy photons for extensive VH is reported. Using PubMed database, a review of the literature is done. The authors have no study funding sources. The authors have no conflicting financial interests. In the literature, good results in terms of pain and neurological deficits are reported. No cases of vertebral fractures are described. However, there is no consensus regarding the treatment for VHs. Radiotherapy is widely utilized in VHs determining pain. Surgery for VHs determining neurological deficit is also widely accepted. Perhaps, regarding the width of the lesion, no indications are given. We consider it important to make an evaluation before initiating the treatment for the risk of pathologic vertebral fracture, since in radiotherapy, there is no convention regarding structural changes determined in VHs. We propose a new algorithm of treatment. We recommend radiotherapy only for small lesions in which vertebral stability is not concerned. Kyphoplasty can be proposed for asymptomatic patients in which VHs are small and in patients affected by VHs determining pain without spinal canal invasion in which the VH is small. In patients affected by pain without spinal canal invasion but in which the VH is wide or presented with spinal canal invasion and in patients affected by neurological deficits, we propose surgery.",eng,0.0

Twelve burst type fractures were generated in porcine three-vertebra segments. The specimens were randomly split into two groups (n=6), imaged using microCT and tested under axial loading. The two groups of fractured specimens underwent a vertebroplasty procedure, one group was augmented with CaP cement designed and developed at Queen's University Belfast. The other group was augmented with PMMA cement (WHW Plastics, Hull, UK). The specimens were imaged and re-tested . An intact single vertebra specimen group (n=12) was also imaged and tested under axial loading. A significant decrease (p<0.01) was found between the stiffness of the fractured and intact groups, demonstrating that the fractures generated were sufficiently severe, to adversely affect mechanical behaviour. Significant increase (p<0.01) in failure load was found for the specimen group augmented with the PMMA cement compared to the pre-augmentation group, conversely, no significant increase (p<0.01) was found in the failure load of the specimens augmented with CaP cement, this is attributed to the significantly (p<0.05) lower volume of CaP cement that was successfully injected into the fracture, compared to the PMMA cement. The effect of the percentage of cement fracture fill, cement modulus on the specimen stiffness and ultimate failure load could be investigated further by using the methods developed within this study to test a more injectable CaP cement.",eng,0.0

Traumatic fractures (n = 17) were generated in a series of porcine vertebrae using a drop-weight method. The fractured vertebrae were imaged using muCT and tested under axial compression. Twelve of the fractured vertebrae were randomly selected to undergo a vertebroplasty procedure using either a PMMA (n = 6) or a CaP cement variation (n = 6). The specimens were imaged using muCT and re-tested. Finite element models of the fractured and augmented vertebrae were generated from the muCT data and used to compare the effect of fracture void fill with augmented specimen stiffness. Significant increases (p < 0.05) in failure load were found for both of the augmented specimen groups compared to the fractured group. The experimental and computational results indicated that neither the CaP cement nor PMMA cement could completely restore the vertebral mechanical behavior to the intact level. The effectiveness of the procedure appeared to be more influenced by the volume of fracture filled rather than by the mechanical properties of the cement itself.",eng,1.0

Patients can sustain additional symptomatic VCFs that may require additional surgical intervention. PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence and predictors of patients who sustain additional symptomatic VCFs that were treated with kyphoplasty. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of patients who previously underwent kyphoplasty for VCFs and had additional VCFs that were treated with kyphoplasty. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 256 patients underwent kyphoplasty for VCFs from 2000 to 2007 at a single medical center. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measure of interest was the need for an additional kyphoplasty procedure for a symptomatic VCF. METHODS: Risk factors such as age, sex, smoking status, and steroid use were assessed, as well as bisphosphonate use. Sagittal spinal alignment via Cobb angles for thoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbar regions was assessed. RESULTS: About 22.2% of the patients had an additional symptomatic VCF that was treated with a kyphoplasty procedure. Steroid use was the only significant risk factor for predicting patients with additional symptomatic VCFs who underwent additional kyphoplasty. The average time to the second VCF was 33 days. Adjacent-level VCFs were most common in the thoracic and thoracolumbar spine. Bisphosphonate use was not shown to be protective of preventing additional VCFs during this follow-up period. CONCLUSION: This is the first single-center review of a large cohort of patients who underwent additional-level kyphoplasty for symptomatic VCFs after an index kyphoplasty procedure. Our results suggest that patients with a VCF who use chronic oral steroids should be carefully monitored for the presence of additional symptomatic VCFs that may need surgical intervention. Patients with prior thoracic VCFs who have additional back pain should be reevaluated for a possible adjacent-level fracture.",eng,0.0

Detailed searches of a number of electronic databases were performed from March to April 2006. Citation searches of included studies were undertaken and no language restrictions were applied. All controlled and uncontrolled studies were included with the exception of case reports. Prognostic factors responsible for pain relief and cement leakage were examined using meta-regression. Combined with previous evidence, a total of eight comparative studies (three against conventional medical therapy and five against vertebroplasty) and 35 case series were identified. The majority of studies were undertaken in older women with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with long-term pain that was refractory to medical treatment. In direct comparison to conventional medical management, patients undergoing BKP experienced superior improvements in pain, functionality, vertebral height and kyphotic angle at least up to 3-years postprocedure. Reductions in pain with BKP appeared to be greatest in patients with newer fractures. Uncontrolled studies suggest gains in health-related quality of life at 6 and 12-months following BKP. Although associated with a finite level of cement leakage, serious adverse events appear to be rare. Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures appear to be associated with a higher level of cement leakage following BKP than non-osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. In conclusion, there are now prospective studies of low bias, with follow-up of 12 months or more, which demonstrate balloon kyphoplasty to be more effective than medical management of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures and as least as effective as vertebroplasty. Results from ongoing RCTs will provide further information in the near future.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures, and to examine the prognostic factors that predict outcome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A previous systematic review of vertebroplasty by Levine et al in 2000 identified seven case series studies and no controlled studies. METHODS: A number of electronic databases were searched through March 1, 2004. Citation searches of included studies were undertaken and contact was made with experts in the field. No language restrictions were applied. All controlled and uncontrolled studies were included with the exception of case reports. Prognostic factors responsible for pain relief and cement leakage were examined using meta-regression. RESULTS: The following studies were included: balloon kyphoplasty (three nonrandomized comparative studies against conventional medical therapy and 13 case series), vertebroplasty (one nonrandomized comparative study against conventional medical care and 57 cases series), balloon kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty (one nonrandomized comparative study). The majority of studies were undertaken in older women with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with long-term pain that was refractory to medical treatment. At this time, there is no good quality direct comparative evidence of balloon kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty. From indirect comparison of case series evidence, the procedures appear to provide similar gains in pain relief while for balloon kyphoplasty there is better documentation of gains in patient functionality and quality of life. The level of cement leakage and number of reported adverse events (pulmonary emboli and neurologic injury) in balloon kyphoplasty was significantly lower than for vertebroplasty. These findings were confirmed by meta-regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There is Level III evidence to support balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty as effective therapies in the management of patients with symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures refractory to conventional medical therapy. Although there was a good ratio of benefit to harm for both procedures, balloon kyphoplasty appears to offer the better adverse event profile. These conclusions need to be updated on the basis of the findings of ongoing randomized controlled trials.",eng,0.0

Zouari,2012.0,[Percutaneous vertebroplasty for pain relief in patients with osteoporotic spine fractures],", ","BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is an interventional radiology technique where pathological vertebral bodies are filled with acrylic cement. This method is used to strengthen the vertebral body and reduce pain in certain diseases involving the vertebrae such as osteoporosis. AIM: To evaluated PVP in symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fractures after failure of conservative management. METHODS: Between November 2008 to December 2009, PVP was performed for osteoporotic vertebral fractures i 12 consecutive patients in a single institution. Medium term (3 days and 15 days post PVP) and long term follow up (1 month and 3 months post PVP) consisted in the evaluation of residual or secondary pain using Huskisson's visual analogue scale. RESULTS: A total of 20 vertebrae were treated. Mean follow up was 80 days (30-90 days). Significant symptomatic improvement (p=0.002) was noted with pre PVP pain score of 7.4 (+/-1.6 ), 3 days post PVP score of 4.1 (+/-2.1), 15 days post PVP score of 1.8 (+/-1.1), 1 month post PVP score of 1.22 (+/-1.06) and 3 months post score of 1.4 (+/-1.14).

Serban,2012.0,Traumatic spinal fracture treated by vertebroplasty: a case report,10.1186/1752-1947-6-390,"UNLABELLED: INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment for lumbar burst fractures is complex and typically involves either a retroperitoneal corpectomy and/or a posterior pedicle screw fixation. We describe the case of a patient with a lumbar burst fracture who was cured via a less invasive approach that has not been previously reported as standalone treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: This 25-year-old Caucasian man presented with excruciating axial low back pain exacerbated by any attempt to elevate the head of the bed after a motor vehicle accident. Computed tomography demonstrated a burst L4 fracture without spinal canal compromise. The patient underwent a bilateral vertebroplasty with an injectable polymer that mimics cortical bone. Postoperatively, the patient was progressively mobilized in a thoracolumbar spinal orthosis brace without any recurrence of pain. Postoperative computed tomography showed no loss of height in the L4 vertebral body. At one-year postoperatively, the patient was symptom free and the computed tomography scan showed good fracture healing. CONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal corpectomy and/or posterior multi-segment fixation for lumbar burst fractures without neural compression in young patients are associated with loss of mobility and potential future adjacent level disease. Our limited vertebroplasty intervention with close postoperative clinical monitoring has not been previously described as standalone treatment, and it offers the advantages of less operative morbidity and maintenance of lumbar mobility in selected patients.",eng,1.0

We performed a biomechanical study of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (Corinplast 3) using three different mixtures of PMMA, monomer, and contrast: group I, 2:1; group II, 3:2; group III, 3:2:1 ratio of powder/monomer/iodinated contrast (Omnipaque). In vitro biomechanical testing of ultimate compressive strength was carried out in all samples. Following the conclusion of a proper bone cement mixture regimen drawn from the in vitro study, PVP was performed in 125 patients: 58 with cancer, 12 with hemangioma, and 54 with osteoporotic fracture. The ultimate compressive strength in group III was decreased by 38% compared to groups II and I. Proper fluoroscopic visualization was achieved in all PVP procedures using this mixture. There were no major complications associated with injection of the cement mixture. Complete (CR) and partial response (PR) was obtained in 64% and 32.8%, respectively. No further vertebral collapse occurred during follow-up. The regimen using iodinated contrast for cement visualization during PVP provides a simple and convenient new method for mixing. Although the biomechanical strength is altered by the contrast medium added, it seems insignificant in clinical practice based on the authors' limited experience.",eng,1.0

Our purpose was to evaluate its effect on the kyphosis angle, wedge angle, and height of the fractured vertebral body. METHODS: We reviewed digital radiographs of 73 vertebral bodies in 53 patients before and after vertebroplasty. We measured the spinal kyphosis angle and the wedge angle of the fractured vertebral body. Ratios of the height of the anterior border, center, and posterior borders of the collapsed vertebra to the height at the posterior border of an adjacent normal vertebral body were measured. Gain from vertebroplasty and the restoration percentage (gain divided by loss) were calculated for each parameter. RESULTS: The kyphosis angle, wedge angle, anterior height, center height, and posterior height significantly improved after vertebroplasty. The mean reduction in the kyphosis angle was 4.3 degrees, and the wedge-angle reduction was 7.4 degrees. The mean wedge-angle reduction in fractured vertebral bodies containing gas was 10.2 degrees. Restoration percentages for the kyphosis angle and wedge angle were 19% and 44%, respectively. Gain in the height of the fractured vertebral bodies was 16.7% for the anterior border, 14% for the center, and 7% for the posterior border. Restoration percentages for the height of the vertebral body were 29% for the anterior border and 27% for the center. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty increases the height of the fractured vertebra and reduces the wedge and kyphosis angles. These effects are most remarkable in fractured vertebra containing gas.",eng,0.0

The objective of the present study was to analyze evolution according to severity of initial kyphosis and quality of fracture reduction. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A single-center prospective study included cases of single compression fracture of the thoracolumbar hinge managed by Kyphon Balloon Kyphoplasty with polymethylmethacrylate bone cement. Radiology focused on traumatic vertebral kyphosis (VK), disc angulation (DA) and disc height index (DHI) in the adjacent discs. Linear regression assessed the correlation between superior disc height index (SupDHI) and postoperative VK on the one hand and correction gain on the other, using the Student t test for matched pairs and Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Fifty-two young patients were included, with mean follow-up of 18.6 months. VK fell from 13.9 degrees preoperatively to 8.2 degrees at last follow-up. DHI found significant superior disc subsidence (P=0.0001) and non-significant inferior disc subsidence (P=0.116). DA showed significantly reduced superior disc lordosis (P=4*10(-5)). SupDHI correlated with VK correction (r=0.32). Preoperative VK did not correlate with radiologic degeneration of the adjacent discs. CONCLUSION: Correction of traumatic vertebral deformity avoids subsidence and loss of mechanical function in the superior adjacent disc. The underlying disc compensates for residual deformity. Balloon kyphoplasty is useful in compression fracture, providing significant reduction of traumatic vertebral deformity while conserving free and healthy adjacent discs.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of percutaneous techniques for these indications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included patients who underwent standalone balloon kyphoplasty surgery or combined with percutaneous posterior osteosynthesis in cases of associated distraction. The fractures were classified according to the Magerl classification. The patients were evaluated clinically (visual analog scale [VAS], the Oswestry Disability Index, and autonomy) and radiologically (vertebral kyphosis and height variations of the vertebral body) for 12 months. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were included. The mean age at the time of the surgery was 45.4 years (range, 19-72 years). The main indications were A.1 fractures of L1. We noted 22% cement leakages, none having a clinical impact. In the overall series, the VAS at the lesional level improved from 5.5 (range, 3-8) preoperatively to 0.6 (range, 1-3) at 12 months. In all, 95% of the workers resumed their occupation. Traumatic kyphosis improved from 13.3 degrees (range, 5-23 degrees ) before the surgery to 8.3 degrees (range, 1-20 degrees ). DISCUSSION: The complication rate was low. The radiological results are comparable to those reported in the literature for other series with percutaneous surgery. Only the loss of the correction observed in the group undergoing standalone kyphoplasty with calcium phosphate cement led us to propose another type of treatment for these indications.

They were initially developed for tumoral and osteoporotic lesions; indications were later extended to traumatology for the treatment of pure compression fracture. They are an interesting alternative to conventional procedures, which are often very demanding. The benefit of these minimally invasive techniques has been demonstrated in terms of alleviation of pain, functional improvement and reduction in both morbidity and costs for society. The principle of kyphoplasty is to restore vertebral body anatomy gently and progressively by inflating balloons and then reinforcing the anterior column of the vertebra with cement. In vertebroplasty, cement is introduced directly under pressure, without prior balloon inflation. Both techniques can be associated to minimally invasive osteosynthesis in certain indications. In our own practice, we preferably use acrylic cement, for its biomechanical properties and resistance to compression stress. We use calcium phosphate cement in young patients, but only associated to percutaneous osteosynthesis due to the risk of secondary correction loss. The evolution of these techniques depends on improving personnel radioprotection and developing new systems of vertebral expansion.",eng,0.0

The technique was developed to prevent the loss of reduction after deflation of the balloon and to reduce the complication rate associated with cement leakage. METHODS: The amount of kyphosis correction, improvement of vertebral body height and quantitative cement leakage rate by applying CT-based quantitative volumetry after VBS were measured in 27 patients (55 vertebra) and compared with a control group (29 patients, 61 vertebrae), which was treated with conventional vertebroplasty. RESULTS: After VBS, a significant improvement was seen in vertebral height, compared to conventional vertebroplasty. The mean improvement in segmental kyphosis and vertebral kyphosis were 5.8 degrees (p < 0.05) and 3.5 degrees (p < 0.05), respectively. In the VBS group, the mean injected volume of cement per vertebral body was 7.33 cm(3) (3.34-10.19 cm(3)). The average amount of cement outside the vertebrae was 0.28 cm(3) (0.01-1.64 cm(3)), which was 1.36% of the applied total cement volume. In the vertebroplasty group, the applied mean volume of the cement per level was 2.7 cm(3) (1-5.8 cm(3)) and the average amount of cement outside the vertebrae was 0.15 cm(3) (0.01-1.8 cm(3)), which was 11.5% (0.2-60%) of the applied total volume of cement.

METHODS: Prospective assessment of short-term (<or=6 weeks), medium-term (6 months) and long-term (29 months) outcomes of vertebroplasty, followed by a retrospective long-term follow-up of patients treated with vertebroplasty compared with conservative therapy. Outcomes measured were visual analogue scale pain scores, analgesic use, disability scores using the Roland Morris Disability questionnaire and a number of new VCFs. RESULTS: In 27 patients with acute VCFs followed prospectively, vertebroplasty resulted in significant reductions in pain levels (56-mm reduction on a 100-mm scale) and disability scores (11.8-point reduction on a 24-point scale) at all follow-up points up to a mean of 29 months compared with pre-vertebroplasty levels (P < 0.001). Analgesic use was significantly less intense in the short and medium term after vertebroplasty (P < 0.005). In 25 patients who had vertebroplasty for VCF, a sustained reduction in all outcomes was demonstrated at a mean follow-up of 30 months, with less pain, significantly lower disability scores (P < 0.05) and less analgesic use (P < 0.05) compared with nine conservatively treated subjects. During the follow-up period, six new VCFs occurred in 4/25 vertebroplasty patients compared with four new VCFs in 2/9 control subjects.

Visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) were used to evaluate pain, quality of life, and performance status before the procedure and at 3 days and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after the procedure. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all patients. Minimal follow-up time was 3 months. Mean VAS scores declined significantly from 7.4 +/- 1.1 before the procedure to 2.5 +/- 0.9 by day 3 after the procedure and were 2.1 +/- 1.1 at 1 month, 2.0 +/- 1.1 at 3 months, 1.9 +/- 1.1 at 6 months, 1.8 +/- 0.9 at 12 months, and 1.7 +/- 0.7 at 18 months after the procedure (P < .001). ODI and KPS scores also changed after the procedure, with significant differences between baseline scores and at each follow-up examination (P < .001). Extraosseous cement leakage occurred in 15 cases without causing any clinical complications. CONCLUSIONS: PVP is a safe and effective treatment for painful osteoblastic spinal metastases. It can relieve pain, reduce disability, and improve function.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted for 653 vertebrae in 356 patients undergoing vertebroplasty at our hospital from May 2007 to January 2011. 251 cases had 438 vertebrae with painful OVCF while 105 cases had 215 vertebrae with VM. Pre-operative computed tomography (CT) was performed to determine the presence of cortical defects or osteolysis and within 3 days after PVP to observe the distribution of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in vertebrae and whether leakage occurred. Volume of PMMA injected into each vertebral body and types of cement leakage were compared between the OVCF and VM groups by Z test or chi(2). The correlation between cortical defects and cement leakages around vertebrae was assessed with Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The successful rate of PVP was 100%. The mean volume of PMMA injected into each vertebra was (5.0 +/- 2.0) ml and (4.0 +/- 1.7) ml in the OVCF and VM groups respectively (P < 0.05). Asymptomatic PMMA leakage was demonstrated by CT in 93 vertebrae (21.2%) in the OVCF group and in 53 vertebrae (28.8%) in the VM group respectively (P < 0.05). Cement leakages into disk were found in 58 vertebrae in the OVCF group and 16 vertebrae in the VM group respectively (P = 0.025). Cement leakages into paravertebral vein were found in 12 vertebrae in the OVCF group and 26 vertebrae in the VM group respectively (P < 0.0001). Correlation was found between cortical defects and cement leakage into paravertebral soft tissues in the OVCF group (r = 0.14) or in the VM group (r = 0.27), between end-plate defects and cement leakage into disk in the OVCF group (r = 0.29) or in the VM group (r = 0.31). CONCLUSION: As a common occurrence in vertebroplasty, cement extravasation is well-tolerated in most patients. It occurs more frequently in the patients with VM than those with OVCF, especially in cases of leakage into paravertebral vein. Cement leakage into disc or paravertebral soft tissue is predisposed in vertebrae with end plate, cortical defects or osteolysis.",chi,0.0

In this study, we show that a Minimally Invasive Pedicle Screw System allows both. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one patients (131 fractures) with fractures between Th 3 and L 5 were treated. The most common fracture type was A3. We treated 52 females and 69 men with a mean age of 56.7 years. In 72% of the cases, the procedure was performed by two experienced spine surgeons. Postoperatively, all patients were examined using a CT-scan. In 61 patients, an anterior stabilization was additionally performed in 33 patients, vertebroplasty or cyphoplasty was performed. Fifteen patients underwent laminectomy. RESULTS: No patient postoperatively developed any additional neurological compromise. In total, 682 screws were placed. In the postoperative CT-scan, we found 16 screws (2.2%) in suboptimal position, 8 with medial and 8 with lateral deviation.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the strength and stiffness of osteoporotic vertebral bodies subjected to compression fractures and 1) not augmented, 2) augmented with unipedicular injection of cement, or 3) augmented with bipedicular injection of cement. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a relatively new method of managing osteoporotic compression fractures, but it lacks biomechanical confirmation. METHODS: Fresh vertebral bodies (L2-L5) were harvested from 10 osteoporotic spines (T scores range, -3.7 to -8.8) and compressed in a materials testing machine to determine intact strength and stiffness. They were then repaired using a transpedicular injection of cement (unipedicular or bipedicular), or they were unaugmented and recrushed. RESULTS: Results suggest that unipedicular and bipedicular cement injection restored vertebral body stiffness to intact values, whereas unaugmented vertebral bodies were significantly more compliant than either injected or intact vertebral bodies. Vertebral bodies injected with cement (both bipedicular and unipedicular) were significantly stronger than the intact vertebral bodies, whereas unaugmented vertebral bodies were significantly weaker. There was no significant difference in loss in vertebral body height between any of the augmentation groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that unipedicular and bipedicular injection of cement, as used during percutaneous vertebroplasty, increases acute strength and restores stiffness of vertebral bodies with compression fractures.",eng,1.0

The mechanism for pain relief following kyphoplasty is not entirely understood, and the restoration of a portion of the lost vertebral height is a subject of debate. We retrospectively reviewed radiographic imaging, pain relief, analgesic intake and functional outcomes in 67 consecutive patients who underwent single- or multilevel kyphoplasty with the primary goal of quantifying the restoration of lost vertebral height.

We performed kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty with alpha-tricalcium phosphate cement (CPC) and PMMA to compare the biomechanical properties. Thirty osteoporotic vertebrae were harvested from nine embalmed cadavers. We randomized the vertebrae into four treatment groups: (1) kyphoplasty with CPC; (2) kyphoplasty with PMMA; (3) vertebroplasty with CPC; and (4) vertebroplasty with PMMA. Prior to injecting the cement, all vertebrae were compressed to determine their initial strength and stiffness. They were then recompressed to determine their augmented strength and stiffness. Although the augmented strength was greater than the initial strength in all groups, there was no significant difference between the two bone cements for either kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. The augmented stiffness was significantly less than the initial stiffness in the kyphoplasty groups, but the difference between the two cements did not reach significance. In the vertebroplasty groups, the augmented stiffness was not significantly different from the initial stiffness.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the biomechanical properties of isolated, fractured, osteoporotic vertebral bodies after treatment by kyphoplasty with one of two cements: alpha-tri-calcium phosphate cement (Biopex-R; Mitsubishi Materials Corp., Tokyo, Japan) or polymethylmethacrylate (Simplex P; Stryker-Howmedica-Osteonics, Mahwah, NJ). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty typically use polymethylmethacrylate cements for the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures. Scant information exists regarding the use of alternative cements in kyphoplasty. METHODS: Simulated compression fractures were created in 24 vertebral bodies (T6-T9, L2-L5) harvested from three female cadavers. Vertebral bodies were assigned to one of two groups: kyphoplasty with Biopex-R or kyphoplasty with Simplex P. The kyphoplasty treatment consisted of inserting bone tamps bipedicularly into each vertebral body, inflating the tamp, and filling the created void with Biopex-R or Simplex P. Pretreatment and post-treatment heights were measured, and the repaired vertebral bodies were recompressed to determine posttreatment strength and stiffness values. Differences were checked for significance (P < 0.05) using a repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. RESULTS: Kyphoplasty with Biopex-R restored strength in the lumbar and thoracic vertebral bodies. Kyphoplasty with Simplex P displayed significantly greater posttreatment strength than initial strength in the thoracic region. Vertebral bodies augmented with either cement were significantly less stiff than their initial conditions, except for the thoracic vertebrae treated with Simplex P, in which stiffness was restored. There was no significant difference in percentage of height restored between the cement treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty with either cement restored initial strength.

Although anterior-posterior surgical stabilization offers an efficacious and durable treatment, the associated high blood loss, long durations of surgery, and prolonged hospitalization are often not tolerable for elderly patients, who are most often medically frail with multiple comorbidities. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report a case of an L2 osteoporotic burst fracture in an elderly patient with significant comorbidities treated with a minimally invasive tubular direct lateral transpsoas approach for L2 vertebrectomy and anterior cage placement. The construct was supplemented by a percutaneous pedicle screw construct and adjacent level vertebroplasty. Duration of surgery was 3.5 hours with a total of 35 mL blood loss. The patient was discharged ambulating 36 hours after surgery and reported marked improvement in pain, disability, and quality of life measures at 6 weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: L2 vertebrectomy by direct lateral transpsoas tube systems supplemented by percutaneous pedicle screws can be performed safely and may allow for anterior column decompression and reconstruction in elderly or comorbid patients not otherwise able to tolerate traditional stabilization procedures.",eng,0.0

This raises the question of pain and neurological complications, which worsen the functional and survival prognosis of this oncological population patients. The surgical treatment must be the most complete as possible: to decompress and stabilize without delaying the management of the oncological disease. Minimal invasive surgery techniques are by definition, less harmful on musculocutaneous plan than opened ones, with a comparable efficiency demonstrated in degenerative and traumatic surgery. So they seem to be applicable and appropriate to this patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We detailed different minimal invasive techniques proposed in the management of spinal metastasis. For this, we used our experience developed in degenerative and traumatic pathologies, and we also referred to many authors, establishing a literature review thanks to Pubmed, Embase. RESULTS: Thirty eight articles were selected and allowed us to describe different techniques: percutaneous methods such as vertebro-/kyphoplasty and osteosynthesis, as well as mini-opened surgery, through a posterior or anterior way. DISCUSSION: We propose a surgical approach using these minimal invasive techniques, first according to the predominant symptom (pain or neurologic failure), then characteristics of the lesions (number, topography, type...) and the deformity degree. Whatever the technique, the main goal is to stabilize and decompress, in order to maintain a good quality of life for these fragile patients, without delaying the medical management of the oncological disease.",fre,0.0

Antimyeloma therapy can lead to symptoms improvement, but these effects can take time to be perceived. Application of radiotherapy prior to peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilisation can impair stem cell collection. Percutaneous vertebroplasty has been proposed as a suitable option to rapidly relieve bone pain from vertebral fractures in MM patients, but, little is known about the effects of this procedure on subsequent PBSC mobilisation, collection and transplant. Eighteen patients (10M/8F, median age 64.5 years) with untreated MM and painful vertebral lesions underwent vertebroplasty prior to proceed to the planned transplant program at our Institution. Forty-one procedures were performed at C2-L5 levels, eight patients were treated at >/=2 levels. Ninety-five per cent of the cases obtained a complete or optimal pain control. All the patients successfully mobilised PBSC (median CD34+ cells = 10.8 x 10(6) /kg) and underwent autologous PBSC transplant; both polymorphonucleates and platelets recovery averaged 11 days. Our data seem to suggest that percutaneous vertebroplasty is useful in newly diagnosed MM patients with painful vertebral fractures as it allows rapid and durable achievement of pain control, without interfering with further treatment.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for poor short-term outcomes after vertebral augmentation procedures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebral compression fractures are the most common fractures of osteoporosis and are frequently treated with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. There is a shortage of information about risk factors for short-term, general health outcomes after vertebral augmentation in the literature. METHODS: Patients older than 65 years who underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty in 2011 and 2012 were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Patient characteristics were tested for association with 30-day adverse events, mortality, and readmission using bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 850 patients met inclusion criteria. The average age was 78.9+/-11.7 years (mean+/-standard deviation) and females made up 70.8% of the cohort. Of these patients, 9.5% had any adverse event (AAE), and 6.6% had a serious adverse event (SAE). Death occurred in 1.5% of patients, and 10.8% were readmitted within the first 30 postoperative days.On multivariate analysis, AAE and SAE were both significantly associated with American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (AAE: odds ratio [OR]=2.7, P=0.013; SAE: OR=2.5, P=0.040) and inpatient status before procedure (AAE: OR=2.7, P<0.001, SAE: OR=2.4, P=0.003). Increased postoperative mortality rate was associated with American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4 (OR=6.4, P=0.024) and the use of nongeneral anesthesia (OR=4.0, P=0.022). Readmission was associated with history of pulmonary disease (OR=2.0, P=0.005) and inpatient status before procedure (OR=1.9, P=0.005).

OBJECTIVE: To sensitize clinicians to the occurrence of perforation on the right side of the heart, with intracavity cement leakage as a potential complication after balloon kyphoplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Balloon kyphoplasty is a minimal invasive technique for symptomatic vertebral fractures. Cement leakage after kyphoplasty is a rare complication compared with vertebroplasty. METHODS: A 68-year-old female patient underwent balloon kyphoplasty after a recent third and fourth lumbar verlebral fracture was diagnosed. RESULTS: The day after balloon kyphoplasty, the patient complained of dyspnea and chest pain. Her hemodynamic status rapidly deteriorated. Acute occlusion of coronary vessels was excluded by coronary angiography. Pericardial tamponade was documented by echocardiography, and pericardial effusion was urgently drained. Computed tomographic scan revealed the presence of cement embolus inside the right ventricle due to right ventricle perforation during the kyphoplasty procedure. The cement embolus was successfully retrieved percutaneously with a snare catheter. CONCLUSION: Balloon kyphoplasty is a minimal invasive technique with low rate of complications.

A guide to correct fracture analysis,", ","The possibilities offered by kyphoplasty in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures have been widely described. Kyphoplasty is technically not very demanding, it can be easily learned and it is minimally invasive when compared to open surgical fracture treatment. Like many other simple surgical methods, it has spread rapidly and as a consequence of the above factors combined with its good reimbursement in many countries, it has experienced a widening in the indications for which it is being employed. The intial purpose of kyphoplasty was pain relief based on vertebral body stabilisation combined with restoration of vertebral body height. An increasingly uncritical use of the method can be observed and as a consequence, an increase in serious complications. During recent years, spinal surgery departments have received an increasing number of patients with serious complications following kyphoplasty, requiring major reconstructive spinal surgery.

We report our experience with inpatient vertebroplasty, with attention to rapidity of discharge and relevant clinical parameters. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the duration of hospitalization in patients admitted with primary diagnoses of back pain or vertebral fracture who were treated with vertebroplasty. We cataloged outcomes in the form of verbal pain scales (graded 0-10), in-hospital medication use (graded 0-6), and posthospitalization medication use. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postvertebroplasty. RESULTS: We identified 66 such patients who had a median total hospital stay of 6.0 days (range, 1-26 days). Median length of stay before and after vertebroplasty were 4.0 (range, 1-24 days) and 1.5 days (range, 0-7 days), respectively. Ten (15%) patients were discharged the day of vertebroplasty. By days 2 and 3, 33 (50%) and 48 (72.7%) of the 66 patients had been discharged. Patients who received vertebroplasty earlier in the course of hospitalization demonstrated greater decreases in medication strength by discharge (P = .045). There was significant improvement in all outcome measures by 1 week, with continued improvement at 1 and 6 months. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that vertebroplasty facilitates a rapid hospital discharge as well as long-term improvement in patients admitted for refractory pain.

We report the use of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) in patients undergoing vertebroplasty for painful osteoporotic compression fractures. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients treated with vertebroplasty who completed the RDQ and 2 verbal pain scales (0-10) for pain at rest and pain with activity at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year post-vertebroplasty. Changes in outcome measures were analyzed by using a paired t test and correlations were assessed with Spearman rho. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between baseline scores and independent variables. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen patients were treated at 164 vertebral levels. At baseline, RDQ scores were associated with rest and activity pain (P < .001 and P = .002, respectively) but were not associated with other independent variables. All 3 outcome scores decreased by 1 week and remained improved through maximal follow-up (P < .001). RDQ scores improved by a mean of 7.0 points at 1 week and remained improved at 1 year (P = .02). RDQ scores correlated with both rest and activity pain, but the absolute correlation was slightly better (+0.15 on average) with activity pain. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent vertebroplasty experienced relief of back pain and symptoms, as shown by improvement in verbal pain and RDQ scores. The RDQ correlates well with measures of pain, shows clinically significant improvement and is responsive to changes across time. More important, the RDQ provides an easily administered, well-validated, back pain-specific outcome measure that could be adopted to assess vertebroplasty outcomes.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,A. T. Trout; D. F. Kallmes; T. J. Kaufmann,2006.0,New fractures after vertebroplasty: adjacent fractures occur significantly sooner,", http://www.ajnr.org/content/ajnr/27/1/217.full.pdf","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whether vertebroplasty increases the risk of adjacent-level vertebral fractures remains uncertain. Biomechanical and clinical studies suggest an increased risk, but compelling data have not yet been put forth to settle this difficult issue. We believe that an analysis of the time interval between vertebroplasty and subsequent fractures may shed additional light on this debate. We specifically hypothesized that subsequent fractures would occur sooner and more frequently in the vertebrae adjacent to the treated level. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the risk and timing of subsequent fractures in patients previously treated with vertebroplasty. Multiple linear regression was used to explore factors that influence the time to new fracture following vertebroplasty. Fractures were then divided on the basis of whether they occurred adjacent or non-adjacent to the treated level. Survival analysis was used to compare time to new fracture among the 2 groups, and the relative risk of both types of fracture was calculated. RESULTS: In this study, 186 new vertebral fractures occurred in 86 (19.9%) of 432 patients. Seventy-seven (41.4%) fractures were of vertebrae adjacent to the level treated with vertebroplasty. Median times until diagnosis of new adjacent and non-adjacent level fractures were 55 days and 127 days, respectively. Time to fracture was significantly different between the 2 groups (logrank <0.0001). Distance of the new fracture from the treated level was also significantly associated with time to new fracture (P < .0001). Relative risk of adjacent level fracture was 4.62 times that for non-adjacent level fracture. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate an association between vertebroplasty and new vertebral fractures. Specifically, following vertebroplasty, patients are at increased risk of new-onset adjacent-level fractures and, when these fractures occur, they occur sooner than non-adjacent level fractures.",eng,1.0

We tested the hypothesis that after vertebroplasty for intraosseous clefts, subsequent fractures would occur earlier and more frequently than after treatment of non-cleft-containing fractures. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 362 patients treated with vertebroplasty for osteoporotic fractures. The location, frequency, and timing of subsequent fractures were compared between 2 subgroups: group 1, patients treated at fractures containing clefts, and group 2, treated patients without clefts. A vertebra-by-vertebra analysis was used to compare the relative risk and timing of subsequent fractures adjacent to vertebrae with or without clefts. RESULTS: Group 1 included 63 patients treated at 65 vertebrae and group 2 included 250 patients treated at 399 vertebrae. Group 1 demonstrated a nearly twofold increased risk of subsequent fracture (odds ratio [OR], 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-3.49, P = .037). At the vertebral level, the relative risk of subsequent fracture was 2.02 (95% CI, 1.46-2.58; P = .013) times greater adjacent to a treated cleft. Fractures adjacent to any treated level occurred significantly sooner than nonadjacent fracture (P = .0004). The presence of a cleft was not significantly associated with the timing of subsequent fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures containing clefts are at increased risk for subsequent fractures and treatment of these clefts is associated with increased rates of adjacent fracture. There is no significant difference in the timing of subsequent fractures based on the presence of a cleft.",eng,1.0

Hentz,2006.0,Vertebral endplate fractures: an indicator of the abnormal forces generated in the spine after vertebroplasty,10.1359/jbmr.060723,"UNLABELLED: Vertebroplasty alters spinal biomechanics and may lead to incident vertebral fractures. The endplate localization of prevalent and incident fractures was evaluated in 86 patients. In the absence of vertebroplasty, superior endplate fractures predominate. After the procedure, inferior endplate fractures are disproportionately common in adjacent vertebrae immediately above the treated level, potentially supporting a causative relationship between vertebroplasty and incident fractures. INTRODUCTION: To determine retrospectively whether new-onset fractures after vertebroplasty tend to cluster in the endplate immediately adjacent to the cemented vertebra. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional Review Board approval and patient consent for use the use of medical records were obtained for this study. We performed a retrospective review of patients with new (incident) vertebral fractures after vertebroplasty. The median age for these patients was 72.5 years, and 58 (67.4%) were women. Fractures were diagnosed on the basis of MRI or bone scan and were catalogued based on their location within the vertebral body (superior endplate, inferior endplate, or holo-vertebral). Chi(2) and generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses were used to compare the distribution of fracture subtypes among pre-existing (prevalent) and incident fractures. RESULTS: The patients had 313 prevalent osteoporotic vertebral fractures and were treated at 137 vertebral levels. Among prevalent fractures, superior endplate fractures predominated (57% superior, 11% inferior; p < 0.0001). After vertebroplasty, 186 incident fractures developed in these 86 patients. Seventy-seven (41%) of these incident fractures occurred adjacent to treated vertebrae. Nonadjacent, incident fractures, like prevalent fractures, occurred predominantly along superior endplate. Incident fractures immediately above treated levels, however, localized disproportionately to the inferior endplate (30% superior, 57% inferior; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There are an increased number of inferior endplate fractures of the vertebral body immediately cephalad to the treated level.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Single-center retrospective observational study of all patients managed with sacroplasty for osteoporotic sacral fractures between October 2008 and November 2009. For each patient, symptom duration, pain intensity, and analgesic consumption were recorded. Sacroplasty was performed under local analgesia, in the prone position, with computed tomography guidance. The long-axis approach was sued to introduce the needles and polymethylmethacrylate cement along the fracture line(s). Pain was evaluated on a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) 24 hours before sacroplasty then at the time of weight-bearing resumption 24 hours after the procedure. Hospital stay length before and after the procedures were recorded. RESULTS: We identified six patients (five women and one man) with a mean age of 83.2 years. All six patients presented with low back pain and four also had buttock pain. The interval from pain onset to diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 1 year. All patients reported that pain onset followed a fall. The mean VAS pain score was 8.2 before sacroplasty and decreased by 7.6 points 24 hours after the procedure (with four patients having a score of 0). Mean hospital stay length were 12 days before and 4 days after sacroplasty. All patients required opioid analgesics before sacroplasty. At discharge, analgesic requirements were a step II analgesic in one patient, acetaminophen in one patient, and no analgesics in four patients. No adverse events were recorded. DISCUSSION: The findings from our small population are consistent with a recent literature review of 15 case-series studies showing a significant analgesic effect of sacroplasty. The rapid effect of sacroplasty allows prompt ambulation, thus avoiding complications related to immobility. CONCLUSION: Sacroplasty is effective in relieving pain due to sacral insufficiency fractures.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From December 2001 to August 2008, 39 patients (17 females, 22 males; mean age, 65+/-7 years) with multiple myeloma suffering from painful spinal osteolyses underwent vertebroplasty. A total of 67 vertebrae were treated in 44 sessions under CT fluoroscopy (single-slice, 4-row CT, and 16-row CT). In the planning CT scan, osteolytic destruction (i.e., none, </=25%, </=50%, </=75%, or </=100%) was assessed regarding the vertebral cross-sectional area, the cortical border of the spinal canal, and the outer circumference. CT performed after vertebroplasty was used to detect local PMMA leaks. Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed with special respect to peri and postinterventional adverse events. Clinical outcomes were assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS) 24 hours before, 24 hours after, and 6 months after vertebroplasty. RESULTS: Overall, 37.3%, 12.0%, and 6.0% of vertebrae showed at least 50% osteolytic involvement of the cross-sectional area, spinal canal, and outer vertebral cortex, respectively. Intradiscal, intraspinal, paravertebral, and intercostovertebral/posterolateral leaks were seen in 21.6%, 35.1%, 43.3%, and 0% of vertebrae, respectively. The ratio of basivertebral to segmental venous leaks was 16.2%/40.5%. No major complications occurred. The mean VAS score decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from 6.4 at 24 hours before vertebroplasty to 3.2 at a mean follow-up of 9.0 months. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty in multiple myeloma can be performed safely under CT fluoroscopy, even with substantial destruction of the vertebral cross-sectional area or cortical bone. A high clinical success rate was achieved, regardless of whether PMMA leaks were present.",eng,1.0

"RESULTS: Painful osteoporotic VCF and osteolysis within the vertebral body due to metastases and multiple myeloma are indications for PVP. Absolute contraindications are, in particular, asymptomatic VCF, alleviation of pain by drug treatment, therapy-refractory coagulopathies, allergies to cement components, and active infections. MRI or CT is indicated before undertaking PVP to assess the fracture age, to exclude other causes of pain, and to evaluate the posterior edge of the vertebral body. High-quality mono- or biplanar fluoroscopy--preferably in combination with CT (fluoroscopy)--is necessary for PVP to minimize the risk of cement leakage. A clear reduction in pain [mean reduction of 6.1 points (VAS)] is achieved in 86-92% of the patients with PVP. Our own study treating 58 patients (mean follow-up 323+/-99 days) revealed a clear alleviation of pain in 77% [-5.7 points (VAS)].",,,,,,,0.0

STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A literature review. METHODS: No direct, randomized studies comparing vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty and standard, nonoperative care are available. RESULTS: The growing literature suggests a role for kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in the management of patients with intractable pain or progressive vertebral collapse after vertebral compression fracture. Both procedures likely offer similar rates of pain relief. Kyphoplasty, although more expensive, may allow fracture reduction. The void created with the balloon tamp allows a more viscous cement to be applied, thereby decreasing the risk of extravasation.

Chen,2016.0,Unplanned revision spinal surgery within a week: a retrospective analysis of surgical causes,10.1186/s12891-016-0891-4,"BACKGROUND: The need for revision surgery after a spinal surgery can cause a variety of problems, including reduced quality of life for the patient, additional medical expenses, and patient-physician conflicts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the causes of unplanned revision spinal surgery within a week after the initial surgery in order to identify the surgical issues most commonly associated with unplanned revision surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients at who received a spinal surgery at a regional medical center from July 2004 to April 2011 in order to identify those who required a revision surgery within one week of their initial surgery. Patients were excluded if they received a vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, or nerve block surgery, because those surgeries are one-day surgeries that do not require hospital admission. In addition, patients with a primary diagnosis of wound infection were also excluded since reoperations for infection control can be expected. RESULTS: The overall incidence of unplanned revision spinal surgery during the time period covered by this review was 1.12% (116/10,350 patients). The most common surgical causes of reoperation were screw malposition (41 patients), symptomatic epidural hematoma (27 patients), and inadequate decompression (37 patients). Screw malposition was the most common complication, with an incidence rate of 0.82%. Screw instrumentation was significantly associated with revision surgery (p = 0.023), which suggests that this procedure carried a greater risk of requiring revision. The mean time interval to reoperation for epidural hematomas was significantly shorter than the intervals for other causes of revision spinal surgery (p < 0.001), which suggests that epidural hematoma was more emergent than other complications. Also, 25.93% of patients who underwent hematoma removal experienced residual sequelae; this percentage was significantly higher than for other surgical causes of revision spinal surgery (p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that to avoid the need for reoperation, screw malposition, inadequate decompression, and epidural hematoma are the key surgical complications to be guarded against. Accordingly, adequate decompression, epidural hematoma prevention, and proper pedicle screw placement may help reduce the incidence of revision surgery.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To report a rare case of anterior spinal cord syndrome caused by a cement embolism in the anterior spinal artery after vertebroplasty.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is commonly performed for the management of pain associated with benign compression fractures, multiple myelomas, lymphomas, vertebral metastatic lesions, and hemangiomas. Here, we describe a severe complication associated with this procedure; a similar complication has not been reported previously.
METHODS: A 63-year-old woman suffered from persistent severe back pain that radiated to both sides of the chest wall 1 week before medical consultation. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of the thoracolumbar spine revealed a pathologic fracture in the body of the T9 and T10 vertebrae, with retropulsion into the spinal canal and compression of the spinal cord at the T10 level. We performed decompressive laminectomy of the T9-10 vertebrae with tumor biopsy and vertebroplasty.
RESULTS: Immediately after the operation, the patient experienced paraplegia and loss of sensitivity to pain/temperature; however, deep pressure sensation and 2-point discrimination below the umbilicus (T10 level) were preserved. Computed tomography scans showed the presence of PMMA in T9 and T10, with opacification of the paravertebral vessels, the left intercostal artery at the T10 level, and a segment of the anterior spinal artery at the T10-11 level.
CONCLUSION: We present the first report describing a case of anterior spinal cord syndrome caused by a cement embolism in the anterior spinal artery after vertebroplasty. The severity of this complication warrants that surgeons should inform patients of the same while obtaining their consent for vertebroplasty.",English,1.0

DESIGN: A population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Taiwan' s National Health Insurance claims data. PARTICIPANTS: All individuals aged >/= 60 years who were newly discharged after hospitalization for a primary VCF diagnosis. INTERVENTION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. MEASUREMENTS: Study outcomes were discharge outcome (re-hospitalization within 1 week, 1 month or 6 months, categorized by diagnosis) and the prescription of anti-osteoporosis medication for secondary fracture prevention. Potential selection bias was adjusted by using propensity score matching to select one conservatively treated patient (e.g. lumbar brace, analgesics, or physical therapy) matched to one patient receiving VK. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 9238 patients who had been discharged after hospitalization for a first-ever VCF between 2004 and 2007. During the index hospitalization, 1018 patients received VK, compared with 8,220 patients who did not receive VK. Patients receiving percutaneous procedure group had a consistently lower incidence of 7-day re-hospitalization for any of the three outcomes (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.32-0.72).

Metastasis can lead to vertebral burst fracture and consequent neurologic compromise. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) is a minimally invasive procedure aimed at restoring vertebral stability by augmentation of weakened vertebrae with bone cement. PV is associated with a complication rate of 10% in treating vertebral metastases. Tumor ablation before cement injection has been suggested to improve PV outcome in the metastatic spine. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of volumetric tumor reduction and cement augmentation in the metastatic spine and to develop a protocol for recommended cement volume to achieve sufficient restoration of intact (nonpathologic) vertebral body stability. METHODS: A biphasic parametric finite element model of an L1 spinal motion segment was developed and validated against previously collected experimental data. Using this model, 12 scenarios were simulated to represent tumor volume reductions of up to 60% and cement augmentation from 1 to 8 mL. CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of intact vertebral stability is possible in metastatic vertebrae after 30% tumor ablation and 1 to 2 mL bone cement augmentation. A protocol was developed on the basis of the findings of this study suggesting recommended cement volume for injection as a function of remaining tumor volume after ablation. These findings may motivate refined methods of prophylactic treatment of metastatic vertebrae.",eng,1.0

Whyne,2005.0,Biomechanical assessment of stability in the metastatic spine following percutaneous vertebroplasty: effects of cement distribution patterns and volume,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.07.023,"Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive, radiologically guided procedure whereby bone cement is injected into structurally weakened vertebrae to provide added biomechanical stability. In addition to treating osteoporotic vertebral fractures, this technique is also used to relieve pain by stabilizing metastatically compromised vertebrae that are at risk of pathologic burst fracture. Optimal cement distribution patterns to improve biomechanical stability to metastatically involved vertebral bodies remain unknown. This study aimed to determine the effect of cement location and volume of cement injected during percutaneous vertebroplasty on improving vertebral stability in a metastatically-compromised spinal motion segment using a parametric poroelastic finite element model. A three-dimensional parametric finite element model of a thoracic spinal motion segment was developed and analyzed using commercially available software. A total of 16 metastatic pre and post vertebroplasty scenarios were investigated using a serrated spherical representation of tumor tissue and various geometric representations of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The effect of vertebroplasty on vertebral bulge, a measure of posterior vertebral body wall motion as an indicator of burst fracture initiation, was assessed. In all cases, vertebroplasty reduced vertebral bulge, but the risk of the initiation of burst fracture was minimized with cement located posterior to the tumor, near the posterior vertebral body wall. Vertebral bulge decreased by up to 62% with 20% cement injection. These findings demonstrate that location and distribution of cement within the vertebral body has a noticeable effect on the restoration of biomechanical stability following percutaneous vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

In opposite mechanism, teriparatide directly stimulates bone formation and improves bone strength and quality faster. The therapeutic effect of teriparatide is better than that of vertebroplasty combined with an antiresorptive treatment and is a potentially useful therapy for new-onset adjacent VCFs after vertebroplasty. INTRODUCTION: Following vertebroplasty, patients are at increased risk of new-onset adjacent-level VCFs. The therapeutic effect of antiresorptive agents is too slow, and they are associated with the risk of new VCFs. Teriparatide markedly increases bone formation and strength and reduces the incidence of new-onset VCFs. This prospective cohort study compared the therapeutic effects of teriparatide with those of combined vertebroplasty and an anti-resorber for treating new-onset adjacent VCFs after vertebroplasty. METHODS: Fifty patients with adjacent VCFs were randomly assigned to two groups: teriparatide only (group A) and additional vertebroplasty combined with an antiresorptive agent (group B). Relevant clinical data of the two groups were prospectively compared. RESULTS: The 22 patients in group A were at higher risk of new VCFs than those in group B (22 patients); they were older and had more pre-existing fractures (p < 0.05). Patients treated with teriparatide had a significantly lower incidence of new-onset VCFs (odds ratio = 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-2.10). Teriparatide-mediated VCF reduction was 78.57%, which was markedly better than that of group B. The teriparatide group had a significant decrease in the visual analog scale and an increase in the Japanese Orthopedic Association low back pain score after 6 months of treatment (p < 0.05). The increase in lumbar spine BMD was marked in the teriparatide group (21.70% vs. 6.87%) after an 18-month treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of post-vertebroplasty adjacent VCFs with teriparatide (no new vertebroplasty) was more effective than that of repeated vertebroplasties combined with an anti-resorber.",eng,0.0

Patients with osteolytic metastases often suffer from intractable local and/or radicular pain. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive, radiologically guided procedure whereby bone cement is injected into structurally weakened vertebrae to provide immediate biomechanical stability. Vertebroplasty is also used to relieve pain by stabilizing metastatically compromised vertebrae that are at risk of pathological burst fracture. In this retrospective study, a total of 57 patients (78 vertebrae) with spinal metastatic tumor were treated with PMMA vertebroplasty. The mean value of the visual analogue scale (VAS) was 8.1 +/- 0.67 preoperatively, and significantly decreased to 3.8 +/- 1.9 (1-8, p < 0.015) one day after vertebroplasty.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics and associated risk factors of new-onset vertebral compression fractures after vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a well-established technique for treating osteoporotic compression fractures. Short-term results are promising, but longer-term studies have suggested a possible accelerated failure rate in the adjacent vertebral body. METHODS.: We retrospectively reviewed patients with osteoporotic compression fractures from January 2000 to June 2006. The patients received percutaneous vertebroplasty with bone cement augmentation. Long-term follow-up radiographically identified the occurrence of vertebral fracture (minimum follow-up 24 months) after an initial vertebral fracture. RESULTS: In 852 patients (1131 vertebrae), 58.8% to 63.8% of new compression fractures after vertebroplasty were adjacent compression fractures. Adjacent fractures occurred much sooner than nonadjacent fractures; (71.9 +/- 71.8 days vs. 286.8 +/- 232.8 days, P < 0.001). In patients who experienced vertebral compression fractures 2 or more times, older age, lower baseline bone mineral density (BMD), and more pre-existing vertebral compression fractures were demonstrated in this study (P < 0.005). The gender and amount of cemented polymethyl methacrylate were not statistically different between Groups A (1 vertebral compression fracture) and B (vertebral compression fracture > or =2 times). CONCLUSION: New-onset vertebral compression fractures occurred repeatedly within a few years after vertebroplasty. New-onset adjacent-level fractures occurred sooner and were more predominate than nonadjacent level fractures. The results of this study suggest that older patient age, lower baseline BMD, and more pre-existing vertebral fractures were found to be risk factors for multiple vertebral compression fractures.",eng,1.0

Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a therapeutic interventional radiology procedure which is used in the management of pain relief in such fractures. It involves the injection of bone cement [polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)] into the collapsed vertebrae under radiological guidance. This provides pain relief as well as increases the strength and stability of the vertebra. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 16 patients with 17 osteoporotic compression fractures which were treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty over an 18-month period were studied. There were all women with the exception of 1 male patient. Their ages ranged from 61 to 87 years. The fracture sites were at the thoracolumbar junction from T12 to L3 levels. The majority of cases only required a unipedicular injection, with bipedicular injections in 3 cases. All cases were performed in the angiographic suite in the radiology departments, with biplanar fluoroscopy in one hospital. PMMA was injected in a semi-solid state under radiological guidance and screening into the collapsed vertebrae. RESULTS: All cases showed good technical success with no mortality or major complications. Only 2 cases had minor complications of cement leakage into the soft tissues of the back and adjacent disc space, respectively. There was sufficient pain relief in all patients and they were well enough to be discharged within 1 to 5 days after the procedure. Patients were followed up to evaluate the degree of long-term pain relief as well as analgesic usage. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a new and minimally-invasive modality of treating pain in patients with osteoporotic compression fractures who are refractory to medical therapy. Under adequate imaging guidance, the risks of complications are minimal while the potential benefit to patients and their care-givers are significant.",eng,0.0

Retrospective clinical studies suggest that kyphoplasty, despite being a procedure with promising potential, may be related to an increased fracture risk of the adjacent untreated vertebrae.
METHODS: A bio-realistic model of a lumbar spine is introduced to determine the morbidity of cemented augmentation. The model was verified and validated for the purpose of the study and subjected to a dynamic finite element analysis. Anisotropic bone properties and solid ligamentous tissue were considered along with alpha time varying loading scenario.
FINDINGS: The yielded results merit high clinical interest. Bi-pedicular filling stimulated a symmetrically developing stress field, thus comparing favourably to uni-pedicular augmentation which resulted in a non-uniform loading of the spine segment. An enslavement of the load transfer was also found to both patient bone mineral density and reinforcement-nucleous pulpous superimposition.
INTERPRETATION: The investigation presented refined insight into the dynamic biomechanical response of a reinforced spine segment. The increase in the calculated occurring stresses was considered as non-critical in most cases, suggesting that prevalent fractures are a symptomatic condition of osteoporosis rather than a sequel of efficiently preformed kyphoplasty.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to demonstrate noninferiority of the Kiva system to balloon kyphoplasty (BK) with respect to the composite primary endpoint. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Annual incidence of osteoporotic VCFs is prevalent. Optimal treatment of VCFs should address pain, function, and deformity. Kiva is a novel implant for vertebral augmentation in the treatment of VCFs. METHODS: A total of 300 subjects with 1 or 2 painful osteoporotic VCFs were randomized to blindly receive Kiva (n = 153) or BK (n = 147). Subjects were followed through 12 months. The primary endpoint was a composite at 12 months defined as a reduction in fracture pain by at least 15 mm on the visual analogue scale, maintenance or improvement in function on the Oswestry Disability Index, and absence of device-related serious adverse events. Secondary endpoints included cement usage, extravasation, and adjacent level fracture. RESULTS: A mean improvement of 70.8 and 71.8 points in the visual analogue scale score and 38.1 and 42.2 points in the Oswestry Disability Index was noted in Kiva and BK, respectively. No device-related serious adverse events occurred. Despite significant differences in risk factors favoring the control group at baseline, the primary endpoint demonstrated noninferiority of Kiva to BK. Analysis of secondary endpoints revealed superiority with respect to cement use and site-reported extravasation and a positive trend in adjacent level fracture warranting further study. CONCLUSION: The KAST study successfully established that the Kiva system is noninferior to BK based on a composite primary endpoint assessment incorporating pain-, function-, and device-related serious adverse events for the treatment of VCFs due to osteoporosis. Kiva was shown to be noninferior to BK and revealed a positive trend in several secondary endpoints. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1.",eng,0.0

Anterior surgery provides good decompression and solid fusion, but the surgery-related risk is relatively higher than that associated with the posterior approach. In posterior surgery, the major problem after posterior correction and instrumentation is failure to support the anterior spinal column, leading to loss of correction of kyphosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of reinforcing short-segment posterior fixation with vertebroplasty and to compare the outcome with those of posterior surgery without vertebroplasty and anterior surgery, retrospectively. METHODS: The authors studied 83 patients who underwent surgical treatment for a single thoracolumbar osteoporotic vertebral collapse with neurological deficit. Twenty-eight patients treated by posterior surgery combined with vertebroplasty (Group A), 25 patients treated by posterior surgery without vertebroplasty (Group B), and 30 patients treated by anterior surgery (Group C) were followed up for a mean postoperative period of 4.4 years. Neurological outcome, visual analog scale pain score, and radiographic results were compared in the 3 groups. RESULTS: Postoperative (4-6 weeks) and follow-up neurological outcome and visual analog scale scores were not significantly different among the 3 groups. Postoperative kyphotic angle was significantly reduced in Group B compared with Group C (p = 0.007), whereas the kyphotic angle was not significantly different among the 3 groups at follow-up. The mean +/- SD loss of correction at follow-up was 4.6 degrees +/- 4.5 degrees , 8.6 degrees +/- 6.2 degrees , and 4.5 degrees +/- 5.9 degrees in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. The correction loss at follow-up in Group B was significantly higher compared with Groups A and C (p = 0.0171 and p = 0.0180, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that additional reinforcement with vertebroplasty reduces the kyphotic loss and instrumentation failure, compared with patients without the reinforcement of vertebroplasty. Vertebroplasty-augmented short-segment fixation seems to offer immediate spinal stability in patients with thoracolumbar osteoporotic vertebral collapse; the effect seems equivalent to that of anterior reconstruction.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 122 osteoporotic compression fractures in 63 patients who underwent preprocedural gadolinium-enhanced MRI and PVP was performed. Based on the extent of contrast enhancement on preprocedural MRI, each case was classified into one of two groups: group 1, which represented more than 50% of the vertebral body enhanced; and group 2, which represented less than 50% of the vertebral body enhanced. The most enhancing level was evaluated in multilevel PVP sessions. We evaluated the difference of pre- and postprocedural pain scales between groups 1 and 2 using Mann-Whitney's U-test.

Fifty-four patients were treated for osteoporosis-related fractures and 5 had malignant disease. Percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed in a conventional manner under local anesthetics and conscious sedation. Preprocedural and postprocedural blood drawing was performed 5 days to 30 minutes before percutaneous vertebroplasty and also at 30 minutes after the injection of bone cement. The difference between preprocedural and postprocedural data of Pao(2) was correlated with patients' age, number of treated vertebral bodies, presence of cement leakage, and presence of malignant neoplasm for each patient. RESULTS: Mean pre-Pao(2) and post-Pao(2) were 80.9 +/- 1.4 and 70.6 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (mean +/- SE) respectively (P = .0001). Using analysis of variance, there was a significant difference according to the number of vertebral bodies. There was a positive trend of decrease in Pao(2) according to the number of vertebral bodies during percutaneous vertebroplasty. Using multiple linear regression and after adjusting by preprocedural Pao(2) and other variables, the number of vertebral bodies was still highly significant.

OBJECTIVE: To describe an intraoperative complication occurring from abdominal aortic penetration during a vertebroplasty procedure for vertebral fractures on Th12 and L1. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive and widely performed procedure in elderly and high-risk patients, although there is a risk of life-threatening complications including aortic injury. However, little is known about the treatment of iatrogenic aortic penetration occurring during a vertebroplasty. METHODS: An 80-year-old female underwent a scheduled vertebroplasty procedure. When the needle was advanced into the L1 vertebral body, arterial blood spurted out from the needle hub and fluoroscopic imaging revealed penetration of the aorta. To minimize bleeding, we depressed blood pressure and kept the needle in place. While vital signs were maintained, we prepared for blood transfusion and circulation monitoring and consulted a cardiothoracic surgeon and a cardiologist. Contrast medium injected via the needle revealed that a hematoma had formed to shift the aortic wall beyond the needle. Circulation was stable while pressure of the needle decreased, thus the hematoma was thought to have become coagulated and the needle was cautiously withdrawn. RESULTS: After placing the patient in a supine position, aortic angiography revealed no leakage around the aorta and she was transferred to the intensive care unit. On postoperative day 1, no leakage around the aorta was confirmed on computed tomographic scans and the patient was extubated. During the 2-year follow-up period, no arterial complication was observed. CONCLUSION: Conservative treatment is optional for accidental aortic penetration during a vertebroplasty when a tamponade effect is expected. In cases with circulatory collapse, when the tamponade effect seems insufficient or a free wall rupture is suspected, prompt removal of the needle and surgical repair should be considered.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in biomechanical stability of vertebral compression fractures repaired using balloon kyphoplasty versus a titanium mesh implant. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebral compression fractures may be stabilized using an expandable balloon followed by cement injection. There are small but finite risks of endplate fracture and cement extravasation with this procedure. Alternative techniques may affect cement injection volumes, height maintenance, and biomechanical stability but require investigation. METHODS: Four male human cadaveric spines from T2 to L5 were used in this study. After determining bone mineral density, individual vertebral bodies were dissected and inspected for previous fractures or additional exclusion criteria. In the remaining vertebral bodies (n=48) anterior wedge fractures were created using a materials testing machine. Fractured vertebral bodies were systematically randomized to be repaired either with balloon kyphoplasty or with titanium mesh implant and polymethylmethacrylate bone cement, using image intensified fluoroscopy. Anterior vertebral body height (cm) was measured initially, after mechanically creating an anterior wedge fracture, after repairing the compression fracture with either technique, and after recompressing the vertebral body following a 24-hour cement polymerization period. Data for cement injection volume (mL) and height maintained following testing (cm) were compared between repair groups using a 1-way analysis of variance (P<0.05). Data for stiffness (N/mm), yield load (N), and ultimate load (N) were compared between intact bodies and repaired bodies using a 2-way analysis of variance (P<0.05). RESULTS: There was significantly less cement injected (P<0.001) and significantly greater height maintained (P<0.025) with the titanium implant group compared to the kyphoplasty group. There were no significant differences in biomechanical stability between the 2 groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The titanium implant was biomechanically equivalent to the kyphoplasty repair while necessitating less cement and providing greater height maintenance in vitro.

Journal Article,T. A. Urlings; E. van der Linden,2013.0,Elastoplasty: first experience in 12 patients,10.1007/s00270-012-0409-x,"PURPOSE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is used increasingly for pain relief in symptomatic neoplastic or osteoporotic compression fractures. However, restoration of the stiffness of the treated vertebrae might propagate secondary fracture of adjacent vertebrae. Elastoplasty might prevent these secondary fractures. We assessed retrospectively our experience with elastoplasty in 12 patients, focusing on silicone migration. METHODS: During the period from July 2011 to January 2012, all patients with an indication for vertebroplasty were treated with elastoplasty. The exclusion criterion was the presence of posterior wall defects. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were performed to evaluate the presence of perivertebral leakage and pulmonary embolism. The prevalence of leakage was compared with the results obtained for vertebroplasty with PMMA reported in the literature. Other complications during the postprocedural period were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-one vertebral bodies in 12 patients were treated with elastoplasty. Silicone pulmonary emboli were detected on the postprocedural chest CT in 60 % (6/10) of the patients. Leakage to the perivertebral venous plexus was seen in 67 % (14/21) of the treated vertebrae. One major complication occurred: severe, medication-resistant dyspnea developed in one patient with multiple peripheral silicone emboli. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary evidence suggests that VK100 silicone cement should not be used in elastoplasty because of the increased risk of silicone pulmonary embolism, when compared with the use of PMMA, which occurs worldwide. The major technical disadvantage is that the time taken for the VK100 silicone material to achieve its final strength is too long for practical application.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) with nonsurgical management (NSM) during 24 months in patients with painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Recently, several large randomized controlled trials have been conducted and reported how vertebral augmentation compares with NSM for patients with acute VCFs. Few of these trials report on the surgical aspects and radiographical vertebral deformity results. METHODS: Adults with 1 to 3 VCFs were randomized within 3 months of pain to undergo bilateral BKP (n = 149) or NSM (n = 151). Surgical parameters, subjective quality of life assessments and objective functional (timed up and go) and radiographical assessments were collected. RESULTS: Compared with NSM, the BKP group had greater improvements in SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) scores at 1 month (5.35 points; 95% CI, 3.41-7.30; P < 0.0001) and when averaged across the 24 months (overall treatment effect 2.71 points; 95% CI, 1.34-4.09; P = 0.0001). The kyphoplasty group also had greater functionality by assessing timed up and go (overall treatment effect -2.49 s; 95% CI, -0.82 to -4.15; P = 0.0036). At 24 months, the change in index fracture kyphotic angulation was statistically significantly improved in the kyphoplasty group (average 3.13 degrees of correction for kyphoplasty compared with 0.82 degrees in the control, P = 0.003). Number of baseline prevalent fractures (P = 0.0003) and treatment assignment (P = 0.004) are the most predictive variables for PCS improvement; however, in patients who underwent BKP, there may also be a link with kyphotic angulation. In BKP, the highest quart for kyphotic angulation correction had higher PCS improvement (13.4 points) than the quart having lowest correction of angulation (7.40 points, P = 0.0146 for difference). The most common adverse events temporally related to surgery (i.e., within 30 d) were back pain (20 BKP, 11 NSM) new VCF (11 BKP, 7 NSM), nausea/vomiting (12 BKP, 4 NSM), and urinary tract infection (10 BKP, 3 NSM). Several other adverse events were possibly related to patient positioning in the operating room. CONCLUSION: Compared with NSM, BKP improves patient quality of life and pain averaged during 24 months and results in better improvement of index vertebral body kyphotic angulation. Perioperative complications may be reduced with more care in patient positioning. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.",eng,0.0

http://www.ajnr.org/content/ajnr/23/6/913.full.pdf","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vertebral venography has been advocated before bone cement injection when performing percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) for benign or malignant lesions of the spine. Although venography can document sites of potential leakage during subsequent cement application, stagnant contrast agent renders the cement injection more difficult to monitor, and an allergic reaction to contrast agent remains a potential risk. We evaluated our experience with PV without prior venographic evaluation.
METHODS: Two hundred five consecutive PV procedures performed in 137 patients without pretreatment venography were evaluated for complications linked to bone cement injection. Treated lesions were 172 benign compression fractures, 27 metastases, two hemangiomas, and four multiple myelomas. PV was performed with a single-pedicle technique in 146 cases and a two-pedicle technique in 59 cases.
RESULTS: No major complication occurred in our series. Three minor complications (1.5%) were documented: One patient had a transient episode of arterial hypotension during cement injection, without cement leak; one patient had a spontaneously resolving patch of cutaneous hypoesthesia at the puncture site; and one patient had a radiculopathy four levels above the treated level, not caused by cement deposition, and successfully treated with a nerve block. None of these three minor complications were related to cement leakage.
CONCLUSION: PV can, in our experience, be performed safely without prior angiographic evaluation of the vertebral venous system.",English,1.0

OBJECTIVES: To describe a case of infected vertebroplasty and to demonstrate the importance of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the diagnosis of such infections.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Infection of the vertebroplasty site is an uncommon complication of vertebroplasty. Only 4 cases have been reported in the literature so far, and an organism could be identified in only 2 of those cases. To our knowledge, the use of PCR to diagnose infection in these cases has not been reported before.
METHODS: Vertebroplasty, laminectomy, radiology, fluid aspiration, microbial culture, and 16S RNA PCR.
RESULTS: A 73-year-old diabetic woman underwent vertebroplasty for L2 and L3 vertebral compression fractures followed by L4-L5 laminectomy for spinal stenosis. Three months later, she had an L1 fracture that was augmented with vertebroplasty. Six months later, she presented with incapacitating low back pain. There was a fluid-filled cavity surrounding the polymethylmethacrylate in the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies. The fluid had 95,000 white blood cells with 96% neutrophils, grew nothing on culture, but had 100% homology with Streptococcus agalactiae on 16S ribosomal nucleic acid analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of infected vertebroplasty with atypical radiologic findings of vertebral infection. To our knowledge, this is the third reported case where an organism could be isolated for these infections and the first time PCR has been used to diagnose such an infection.

Majernicek,2009.0,[Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty--treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures],", ","PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The surgical treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures is associated with many complications. Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are minimally invasive procedures allowing us to strengthen the vertebral body and thus stabilize it. The aim of this non-randomized study is to evaluate a group of patients treated by VP and KP procedures and to discuss related risks. MATERIAL Between September 2005 and October 2007, a total of 32 patients (37 vertebrae) were treated by the VP and KP techniques. Vertebroplasty was used in 21 and kyphoplasty in 11 patients. In this initial group, four patients were excluded from evaluation because of a tumour aetiology of the fracture. The remaining 28 patients who had an osteoporotic vertebral body fracture verified by CT scan findings were followed up and evaluated. METHODS The evaluation was based on modified Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores recorded at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Cement leakage detected by X-ray was assessed by means of the classification used by Yeom et al. and, at the same time, the occurrence of adjacent vertebral fracture, if any, was detected by 1 year after surgery. RESULTS Radiographic cement leakage was found in eight patients (21.6%), with clinical manifestation in two (5.4%). One had an incomplete motor lesion due to cement leakage into the spinal column, and the other had pulmonary embolism due to cement leakage into the mediastinum. The whole group showed marked improvement in clinical condition, as assessed by the ODI. When expressed as per cent, the average ODI was 57% pre- and 15.7 % post-operatively. All patients reported pain relief in the affected spine. The average VAS score of 8.1 pre-operatively decreased to an average of 2.6 post-operatively. There were no radiographic findings of adjacent vertebral body fracture. DISCUSSION Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are currently used to treat osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Their advantages include an immediate stabilization of the vertebra by cement solidification, possibility of percutaneous application under local anaesthesia, and early patient mobilization without any external fixation. However, when evaluating these techniques, safety of the surgical procedure should be taken into consideration. The most frequent risk is cement leakage. CONCLUSIONS Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can, under strict adherence to the operative protocol, be an effective approach to the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fracture. It permits early mobilization of the patient without the necessity of external fixation. Key words: vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, osteoporotic spine fracture, osteoporosis.",cze,0.0

We assessed the proportion of patients who developed chronic back pain and possible risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In VERTOS II, the VAS score was assessed at regular intervals until 1 year follow-up. We followed 95 conservatively treated patients until sufficient pain relief, defined as a VAS score </=3. These patients were censured at the involved follow-up interval. In addition, baseline clinical and imaging data, and class of pain medication used in patients with a VAS score </=3 at any follow-up interval were compared with those in patients with a VAS score >3 at every follow-up by using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: During 1 year of follow-up, 57 of 95 patients (60%) had sufficient pain relief with VAS scores </=3. Thirty-eight patients (40%) still had pain with VAS-scores >/=4 at the last follow-up interval of 12 months, despite the use of higher class pain medication. Statistical analysis showed no risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In the VERTOS II trial, most conservatively treated patients with acute osteoporotic compression fractures had sufficient pain relief during the first 3 months.

To assess the true incidence of PCE, we performed native chest CT during follow-up in a large proportion of patients from the VERTOS II trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: VERTOS II is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing PV with conservative therapy in 202 patients. After a mean follow-up of 22 months (median, 21 months; range, 6-42 months), 54 of 78 patients (69%) with 80 vertebrae treated with PV underwent native chest CT to detect possible PCE. The presence, location, number, and size of PCE were recorded. In addition, the presence of pulmonary parenchymal changes adjacent to PCE was noted. Possible risk factors for PCE, such as age, sex, number of treated vertebrae, cement volume per vertebra, and presence and location of perivertebral cement leakage, were evaluated. RESULTS: PCE was detected in 14 of 54 patients (26% 95% CI, 16%-39%). All patients were asymptomatic. Cement emboli were small and randomly distributed in peripheral small vessels. There were no reactive pulmonary changes. Cement leakage in the azygos vein was the only risk factor for the occurrence of PCE (OR, 43; 95% CI, 5-396).

There is some concern that cement deposits may migrate towards the lungs via the veins during follow-up. We used baseline and follow-up computed tomography (CT) to assess the incidence and extend of late cement migration in a large consecutive patient cohort.
METHODS: VERTOS II is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing PV with conservative therapy for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). Patients assigned to PV had baseline postprocedural CT scans of the treated vertebral bodies. After a mean follow-up of 22 months, 54 of 78 patients (69%) had follow-up CT. CT scans were analyzed and compared for perivertebral venous, discal, and soft tissue leakage.
RESULTS: Perivertebral cement leakage occurred in 64 of 80 treated vertebrae (80%; 95% CI, 70% to 87%). All patients remained asymptomatic. Perivertebral venous leakage was present in 56 vertebrae (88%), mostly in the anterior external venous plexus (46 of 56, 82%). Discal leakage occurred in 22 of 64 vertebrae (34%) and soft tissue leakage in two of 64 (4%). Mean injected cement volume in vertebrae with leakage was higher (4.5 versus 3.7 cm(3), p=0.04). Follow-up CT scan showed unchanged perivertebral cement leakages without late cement migration.
CONCLUSION: Perivertebral cement leaks during PV for OVCFs occurred frequently in the VERTOS II trial. Cement leakage occurred more frequently with higher injected volumes. However, all patients remained asymptomatic, and late cement migration during follow-up did not occur. Standard postprocedural CT of the treated vertebral body in PV is not necessary.",English,1.0

In this study we evaluated the pain course in conservatively treated patients with back pain and a VCF on the spine radiograph. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May 2007 and November 2008, 169 patients with back pain referred by the general practitioner for spine radiographs and with a VCF were requested to participate in this follow-up study. Base line questionnaires about visual analogue scale (VAS) score, type of treatment and use of osteoporosis medication were filled in by 82 patients. Questionnaires were repeated at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Significant pain relief was defined as a decrease in VAS score of 50% or more from baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, mean VAS score in 82 patients was 6.9 (SD 2.0). Significant pain relief at 12 months was reported by 44 patients (54%) while in 38 patients (46%) pain relief was insufficient. No predictors for pain relief could be identified. Patients with insufficient pain relief at 12 months used significantly more analgesics and in these patients physiotherapy did better than other types of therapy. CONCLUSION: More than half of conservatively treated patients with back pain and VCF had sufficient pain relief at 12 months with most pain decrease in the first 3 months. However, a substantial proportion of patients still reported disabling pain. There were no predictors for the development of chronic pain.

Frequency, outcome, and imaging findings of PMMA pulmonary embolism are poorly understood. We retrospectively assessed the frequency and outcome of PMMA embolism during PV in a large patient cohort and evaluated the relationship of the volume of injected PMMA to the occurrence of pulmonary PMMA embolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2001 and 2007, 532 osteoporotic compression fractures in 299 consecutive patients were treated with PV. PMMA embolism was defined as venous PMMA migration toward the lungs visible on biplane fluoroscopy during PV. CT was performed immediately and 1 year after PMMA migration. RESULTS: Venous PMMA migration occurred during 11 PVs in 11 patients (2.1%, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.7%). CT in 8 patients demonstrated small peripheral pulmonary PMMA emboli. All 11 patients remained asymptomatic during 1-year follow-up. Repeat CT scanning after 1 year in 6 patients demonstrated unchanged pulmonary PMMA deposits without late reactive changes. Mean injected cement volume in patients with and without PMMA embolism was not different (3.6 +/- 1.06 mL versus 3.3 +/- 1.16 mL, P = .43). Similar comparison for thoracic and thoracolumbar vertebrae yielded P values of .07 and .9. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary PMMA embolism during PV is an infrequent complication without permanent clinical sequelae. After 1 year, no pulmonary reaction was seen on CT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2003 and March 2009, 98 patients (78 women; 20 men) with a clinical and imaging suspicion of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures underwent coaxial biopsy in conjunction with PVP of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Mean age at the time of the procedure was 72.6 years. A pathologist interpreted all the biopsy samples. RESULTS: In 83 patients, the biopsy results were consistent with the presumed osteoporotic aetiology. In two patients, a malignancy was identified. Biopsy samples from 13 patients were considered insufficient or unsuitable by the pathologist for evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the number of biopsy samples considered insufficient or unsuitable, coaxial biopsy during PVP is useful in verifying the presumed aetiology of vertebral compression fractures, which is often unclear on the basis of clinical and imaging examinations. It is therefore both convenient and advisable to perform a vertebral coaxial biopsy in all patients undergoing a PVP.","eng

OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and safety of balloon vertebroplasty after posterior short-segment reduction and fixation for the treatment of traumatic burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Hardware failure and loss of reduction after posterior short-segment instrumentation are complications caused by insufficiency of anterior column support. This is due to migration of disc tissue through the endplate into the fractured vertebral body that cannot be restored with posterior instrumentation. METHODS: Patients with traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures without neurologic deficits were included. After posterior reduction and fixation, bilateral transpedicular balloon reduction of the endplate was performed, and calcium phosphate cement was injected. Preoperative and postoperative Cobb angle and central and anterior height were assessed with radiographs and MRI. RESULTS: Twenty patients underwent surgery without technical difficulties, and a substantial reduction of the endplates could be achieved with the technique. All patients recovered uneventfully, and the neurologic examination revealed no deficits. The postoperative radiographs and magnetic resonance images demonstrated a good fracture reduction and filling of the bone defect without unwarranted bone displacement. The central and anterior height of the vertebral body could be restored to 78 and 91% of the estimated intact height, respectively. Complications were cement leakage in five cases without clinical implications and one wound hematoma. CONCLUSIONS: Transpedicular balloon vertebroplasty for the direct restoration of burst fractures seems feasible in combination with posterior instrumentation. Cement leakage occurred but had no clinical consequences.",eng,0.0

The treatment of vertebral compression fractures has, for many years until the advent of vertebroplasty, consisted of bedrest and analgesics. Vertebroplasty is a percutaneous technique during which bone cement is injected in a vertebral body to provide immediate pain relief by stabilization. Inflatable bone tamps can, prior to the injection of cement, be used to create a void in the vertebral body, in which case the technique is known as balloon vertebroplasty (or kyphoplasty). The chance of extracorporal cement leakage is smaller for balloon vertebroplasty than for vertebroplasty. Some authors also claim to have gained some correction in vertebral body height or angulation. Both interventions can be used for several indications, including osteoporotic compression fractures and osteolytic lesions of the vertebral body such as myeloma, hemangioma or metastasis, and also for traumatic burst fractures in combination with pedicle screw instrumentation. Polymethyl methacrylate cement is the bone void filler that is used most frequently, although the application of calcium phosphate cements has been studied widely in vitro, in vivo and also in small-scale clinical series. The clinical results of (balloon-) vertebroplasty are favorable with 85-95% of all patients experiencing immediate and long-lasting relief of pain. Serious complications are relatively rare but include neurological deficit and pulmonary embolism. In this paper, both vertebroplasty and balloon vertebroplasty and their respective indications, techniques and results are described in relation with the application and limitations of permanent and resorbable injectable bone cements.",eng,0.0

Balloon-assisted endplate reduction (BAER) and subsequent calcium phosphate cement augmentation may prevent this event by restoring the disc space boundaries. The results of the first studies using BAER after pedicle screw fixation are encouraging, showing good fracture reduction, few complications, and minimal loss of correction at 2 years of follow-up. PURPOSE: To present the clinical and radiological outcome of 20 patients treated for traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures with pedicle screws and BAER after a minimum of 6 years follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective trial. PATIENT SAMPLE: Twenty consecutive neurologically intact adult patients with traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiological parameters (wedge/Cobb angle on plain radiographs and mid-sagittal anterior/central vertebral body height on magnetic resonance imaging scans) and patient reported parameters (EQ-5D and Oswestry Disability Index) were used. METHODS: All patients had previously undergone pedicle screw fixation and BAER with calcium phosphate cement augmentation. The posterior instrumentation was removed approximately 1.5 years after index surgery. Radiographs were obtained preoperatively, postoperatively, after removal of the pedicle screws, and at final follow-up (minimum 6 years post-trauma). Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained preoperatively, 1 month after index surgery, and 1 month after pedicle screw removal. Health questionnaires were filled out during the last outpatient visit. RESULTS: The pedicle screw instrumentation was removed uneventfully in all patients and posterolateral fusion was observed in every case. The mean wedge and Cobb angle converged to almost identical values (5.3 degrees and 5.8 degrees , respectively) and the mid-sagittal anterior and central endplates were reduced to approximately 90% and 80% of the estimated preinjury vertebral body height, respectively; this reduction was sustained at follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes showed favorable results in 79% of the patients. One patient required (posterior) reoperation due to adjacent osteoporotic vertebral body collapse after pedicle screw removal. CONCLUSIONS: Balloon-assisted endplate reduction is a safe and low-demanding adjunct to pedicle screw fixation for the treatment of traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures. It may help achieve minimal residual deformity and reduce the number of secondary (anterior) procedures. Despite these positive findings, one in five patients experienced daily discomfort and disability.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVES: To assess, in a burst fracture model, the vertebral body and adjacent disc heights, in parallel sagittal planes with 3-dimensional (3D) rotational x-ray imaging, at various phases during pedicle screw fixation and subsequent balloon vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In recent human cadaveric thoracolumbar fracture studies, it was found that vertebral body height could be restored significantly with inflatable bone tamps. However, limited quantitative data exist on the amount of fracture reduction that can be achieved and how much of the reduction will be lost after deflation and removal of the bone tamps before the cement is injected. METHODS: Twenty burst fractures were created and balloon vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement was performed after pedicle screw instrumentation. A 3D dataset was obtained during the following phases: intact, fractured, after reduction and stabilization with pedicle screws, after inflation of the balloons, after deflation and removal of the balloons, after injection of the cement. The fractured vertebral body and adjacent disc heights were measured from five reconstructed sagittal images and compared for the six phases of the procedure. Furthermore, the difference between the vertebral body height centrally and peripherally was calculated. RESULTS: The mean vertebral body height at the thoracic level was Tintact = 19.5 +/- 2.2 mm, Tfractured = 14.6 +/- 3.8 mm, Treduction = 17.3 +/- 2.2 mm, Tinflation = 20.1 +/- 2.0 mm, Tdeflation = 18.0 +/- 2.0 mm, and Tcement = 17.8 +/- 1.8 mm. The overall change in vertebral body height between these phases was significant (P < 0.001). At the lumbar level the mean vertebral body height was Tintact = 23.2 +/- 3.8 mm, Tfractured = 14.7 +/- 3.0 mm, Treduction = 18.4 +/- 2.5 mm, Tinflation = 23.2 +/- 3.5 mm, Tdeflation = 19.3 +/- 2.3 mm, and Tcement = 20.2 +/- 2.8 mm. The overall change in MCVBH between these phases was also significant (P < 0.001). The increase in vertebral body height resulted in a decrease of the adjacent disc height. No difference was found for the amount of endplate reduction in the center or at the periphery. No leakage of cement was detected in the spinal canal. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of endplate fractures, both in the center and at the periphery, seems feasible and safe with combined fracture reduction and balloon vertebroplasty. The endplate fracture reduction that was gained by inflation of the bone tamps could not be maintained after deflation.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVES: To investigate, in a burst fracture model with and without longitudinal ligament damage, the amount of ABD, PBD, and cement leakage at various phases during balloon vertebroplasty in combination with pedicle-screw instrumentation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The role of intact longitudinal ligaments in traumatic spine fractures, for prevention of bone retropulsion and subsequent reduction, has been discussed in several studies but is still up for debate. In a recent human cadaveric burst fracture study, inflatable bone tamps and calcium phosphate cement were used for the augmentation of the anterior column after pedicle-screw instrumentation. The additional balloon vertebroplasty procedure was found to be feasible and safe, but no data pertaining to unwarranted bone displacement or cement leakage during the procedure are available for burst fractures with damaged longitudinal ligaments. METHODS: Ten thoracic and 10 lumbar burst fractures, with rotation or flexion components, were created, and balloon vertebroplasty with calcium phosphate cement was performed after pedicle-screw instrumentation. Volumetric datasets (using the 3-dimensional (3D) rotational x-ray imaging technique) of the fractures were obtained during the following phases: intact, fractured, after reduction and stabilization with pedicle-screws, after inflation of the balloons, after deflation and removal of the balloons, and after injection of the cement. The amount of ABD and PBD was measured on reconstructed sagittal images and recorded together with the presence of extracorporal cement leakage. The continuity of the longitudinal ligaments was assessed after anatomic dissection. RESULTS: During the balloon vertebroplasty procedure, a significant (P < 0.05) increase of ABD (at both thoracic and lumbar level) and PBD (thoracic level) occurred after inflation of the balloons. After deflation and subsequent injection of the cement, however, the ABD and PBD returned to the preinflation levels. The absolute amount of ABD and PBD (<1 mm) during inflation was considered of little clinical importance. No differences in ABD or PBD were observed for specimens with or without continuity of the corresponding longitudinal ligament, irrespective of the level, at any of the phases during the experiment (P > 0.5 in all cases). A small amount of cement leakage was observed in the psoas compartment of one specimen with intact longitudinal ligaments. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that balloon vertebroplasty after pedicle-screw instrumentation may safely be used, in terms of bone displacement and cement leakage, in fracture types where damage to longitudinal ligaments is to be expected.",eng,1.0

Niessen,2005.0,Three-dimensional rotational X-ray imaging for spine surgery: a quantitative validation study comparing reconstructed images with corresponding anatomical sections,", ","STUDY DESIGN: A validation study was done in which reconstructed three-dimensional rotational x-ray images were quantitatively compared with corresponding anatomic sections. OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy of reconstructed images acquired on a three-dimensional rotational x-ray imaging device. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive procedures have proven quite successful as alternatives for a multitude of open treatments. An unfavorable property of this type of procedure is a lack of direct vision of the operating area. Three-dimensional rotational x-ray imaging may be able to merge the advantages of computed tomography and fluoroscopy: real-time two-dimensional projections for fast visual feedback and three-dimensional reconstructions for detailed volumetric imaging of complex anatomy. METHODS: Twenty traumatic thoracolumbar burst fractures were created and underwent pedicle screw instrumentation and balloon vertebroplasty. Subsequently, a three-dimensional dataset was obtained, and the midsagittal image was reconstructed. The specimens were sliced, and photographs were obtained. Multiple parameters on the reconstructed images and photographs were measured two times by two observers using a graphical method. The differences and standard deviations were calculated for the corresponding parameters and for the intraobserver data. RESULTS: The mean difference between the corresponding values ranged between -1.1 and 2.1 mm for all parameters. The standard deviation for the differences per parameter ranged between 1.2 and 3.2 mm. The intraobserver differences ranged from -0.8 to 1.4 mm, and the standard deviation varied between 0.4 and 2.4 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The reconstructed midsagittal images were accurate in all measured parameters. The three-dimensional rotational x-ray technique may prove to be valuable for less invasive spine surgery.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and safety of balloon vertebroplasty followed by calcium phosphate cement augmentation to prevent recurrent kyphosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Failure after short-segment pedicle-screw fixation for the treatment of vertebral fractures is probably caused by a redistribution of disc material through the fractured endplate into the vertebral body, causing a decrease in anterior column support. This lack of support can give rise to instrument breakage and recurrent kyphosis after removal of the instrumentation. Restoration of the endplate morphology could prevent these events. METHODS: Twenty-three traumatic fractures of thoracolumbar vertebrae were created. All fractures were distracted and fixated with short-segment pedicle screws and rods. Transpedicularly introduced inflatable bone tamps and subsequent injection of calcium phosphate cement were used to restore the endplates. Quantitative analyses of magnetic resonance images obtained at three time points were used to evaluate the morphology of the vertebral body and disc-space. After slicing all specimens, macroscopical examination was performed to detect leakage of cement or bone displacement in undesired directions. RESULTS: No technical problems were encountered during the study. The balloon vertebroplasty resulted in a significant (P = 0.0014) decrease of cranial endplate impression. No cement leakage or undesired bone displacement could be detected radiologically or macroscopically. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that balloon vertebroplasty may be a safe and feasible procedure for the restoration of traumatic thoracolumbar vertebral fractures.",eng,1.0

Use of interventional imaging systems in minimally invasion procedures such as kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty gives the advantage of high-resolution images, various zoom levels, different working angles, and intraprocedure image processing such as three-dimensional reconstructions to minimize complication rate. Due to the recent technological improvement of rotational angiographic units (RAU) with flat-panel detectors, the useful interventional features of CT have been combined with high-quality fluoroscopy into one single machine. Intraprocedural 3D images offer an alternative way to guide needle insertion and the safe injection of cement to avoid leakages. Case Report. We present the case of a 72-year-old female patient with insidious lumbar pain. Computed tomography revealed a wedge-shaped osteoporotic compression fracture of T10 vertebrae, which was treated successfully with the installation of vertebral stenting system and vertebroplasty with methacrylate guided with a rotational interventional imaging system. Conclusion. Rotational angiographic technology may provide a suitable place for the realization of high-quality minimally invasive spinal procedures, such as kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty, and vertebral stenting. New software programs available nowadays offer the option to make three-dimensional reconstructions with no need of CT scans with the same degree of specificity.",eng,0.0

METHODS This retrospective analysis included all patients who had been treated with 24-Gy, single-fraction, image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy for histologically confirmed solid tumor metastases over an 8-year period (2005-2013) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Charts and imaging studies were reviewed for post-SRS kyphoplasty or surgery for mechanical instability. A Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) was calculated for each patient both at the time of SRS and at the time of intervention for VCF. RESULTS Three hundred twenty-three patients who had undergone single-fraction SRS between C-1 and L-5 were included in this analysis. The cumulative incidence of VCF 5 years after SRS was 7.2% (95% CI 4.1-10.2), whereas that of death following SRS at the same time point was 82.5% (95% CI 77.5-87.4). Twenty-six patients with 36 SRS-treated levels progressed to symptomatic VCF requiring treatment with kyphoplasty (6 patients), surgery (10 patients), or both (10 patients). The median time to symptomatic VCF was 13 months. Seven patients developed VCF at 11 levels adjacent to the SRS-treated level. Fractured levels had no evidence of tumor progression. The median SINS changed from 6.5 at SRS (interquartile range [IQR] 4.3-8.8) to 11.5 at stabilization (IQR 9-13). In patients without prior stabilization at the level of SRS, there was an association between the SINS and the time to fracture. CONCLUSIONS Five years after ablative single-fraction SRS to spinal lesions, the cumulative incidence of symptomatic VCF at the treated level without tumor recurrence was 7.2%. Higher SINSs at the time of SRS correlated with earlier fractures.",eng,1.0

Pain in patients with cancer,https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1533-2500.2011.00473.x,"Pain in patients with cancer can be refractory to pharmacological treatment or intolerable side effects of pharmacological treatment may seriously disturb patients' quality of life. Specific interventional pain management techniques can be an effective alternative for those patients. The appropriate application of these interventional techniques provides better pain control, allows the reduction of analgesics and hence improves quality of life. Until recently, the majority of these techniques are considered to be a fourth consecutive step following the World Health Organization's pain treatment ladder. However, in cancer patients, earlier application of interventional pain management techniques can be recommended even before considering the use of strong opioids. Epidural and intrathecal medication administration allow the reduction of the daily oral or transdermal opioid dose, while maintaining or even improving the pain relief and reducing the side effects. Cervical cordotomy may be considered for patients suffering with unilateral pain at the level below the dermatome C5. This technique should only be applied in patients with a life expectancy of less than 1 year. Plexus coeliacus block or nervus splanchnicus block are recommended for the management of upper abdominal pain due to cancer. Pelvic pain due to cancer can be managed with plexus hypogastricus block and the saddle or lower end block may be a last resort for patients suffering with perineal pain. Back pain due to vertebral compression fractures with or without pathological tumor invasion may be managed with percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. All these interventional techniques should be a part of multidisciplinary patient program.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the setting, flowing, and biocompatibility properties of new iron-modified calcium phosphate bone cements.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are efficient procedures for the treatment of painful vertebral compression fractures. Nowadays, calcium phosphate cements are used to treat these fractures mainly due to the similar bone apatitic phase formed after setting. However, clinicians have reported great difficulties in filling the vertebral bodies due to the high pressures needed to inject these materials. Thus, new approaches are needed to improve the initial flowing properties of these cements without affecting or even improving their short-term mechanical stability and their long-term in vivo cement transformation into bone tissue.
METHODS: Cement setting times were measured by the Gillmore needles method. The evolution of the compressive strength accounted for the cement hardening process. Scanning Electron Microscopy followed the evolution of the cement microstructure with hardening. Radiograph diffraction analysis confirmed the evolution of the crystalline phases underlying the setting and the hardening processes. Injectability tests were performed by using syringes filled with bone cement and recording the evolution of the injection force needed to empty the syringe. Finally, the cytocompatibility was analyzed by culturing human epithelial cells onto the cements and evaluating both the relative cell viability and the adhesion cell density.
RESULTS: The modification of the powder phase of an alpha-tricalcium phosphate cement with iron oxide nanopar-ticles significantly enhanced, at constant liquid to powder cement mixing ratio, the resulting cement injectability by lowering the extrusion force required for cement delivery. For example, 24 wt% iron oxide addition resulted in 83% of cement injected with an extrusion force lower than 25 N. In fact, the setting and the working times of the cement pastes increased with iron oxide addition. Moreover, the new cement pastes showed improved compressive strength in agreement with the crystalline microstructure evolved during hardening. However, iron modification did not produced cytotoxic cements as compare to nonmodified cements.
CONCLUSION: It has been shown that the addition of iron oxide nanoparticles into the powder phase of an alpha-tricalcium phosphate based cement improved both, the initial injectability and maximum compressive strength of the cement without affecting their physico-chemical setting reactions and their cytocompatibility. These results could be further exploited by designing improved injectable apatitic cements with suitable mechanical properties and in vivo cement transformation ratios into bone tissue by incorporating phases creating porosity.",English,0.0

Journal Article,G. Voggenreiter,2005.0,Balloon kyphoplasty is effective in deformity correction of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures,", ","STUDY DESIGN: A prospective radiographic analysis of deformity correction during the balloon kyphoplasty procedure. OBJECTIVE: To determine the spontaneous reduction of the deformity in prone position, the subsequent deformity correction by the inflatable bone tamp, and the overall deformity correction after deposition of the cement. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Fracture mobility has been shown to contribute to fracture reduction in vertebroplasty. Spontaneous reduction has not been taken into account in recently published series of balloon kyphoplasty, but it must be considered when performing vertebral augmentation and when reporting and interpreting the significance of vertebral height restoration. METHODS: A consecutive series of 39 osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were treated in 30 patients. Lateral radiographs were taken and analyzed at six different time points: 1) Preoperative standing. During the kyphoplasty procedure, four consecutive radiographs were obtained: 2) after placing the patient in prone position on the operation table, 3) after inflation of the bone tamp (IBT), 4) after deflation and removal of the IBT, and 5) after deposition of the cement. 6) Standing lateral radiographs were taken after the procedure. All fractures were analyzed for improvement in sagittal alignment (Cobb angle, kyphotic angle, sagittal index, vertebral height), complications, and reduction of pain (VAS). RESULTS: Placement of the patient in prone position displayed a significant spontaneous reduction in deformity of 6.5 degrees +/- 4.1 degrees Cobb angle. Inflation of the IBT demonstrated a further reduction of the fracture and a significant improvement of the Cobb angle of 3.4 degrees compared with baseline prone. After deflation and removal of the IBT and placement of the cement, no significant loss of fracture reduction was seen. Postoperative measurement of the Cobb angle by means of standing radiographs demonstrated a 3.1 degrees significant loss of reduction compared with the intraoperative measurement in prone position after cement application. Cement leaks occurred in 9 of 39 vertebral fractures. All patients subjectively reported immediate relief of their typical fracture pain. The VAS score significantly improved from 8.7 +/- 1.4 before surgery to 2.3 +/- 0.9.

The study group consisted of 87 patients with 145 VCFs which were not responsive to non-operative treatment. All data were collected prospectively. Improvement of sagittal alignment (Cobb and kyphotic angles, anterior, middle and posterior height) was determined from CT scans. Pain was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS). Postoperative CT scans revealed a significant reduction of the mean kyphotic angle of 5.7 degrees (range 2-24 degrees ) and a significant reduction of pain from 7.8+/-2.4 to 2.0+/-1.5 in the VAS (improvement of pain in 95.5% of patients). An asymptomatic leakage of cement was observed in 28 out of 145 vertebrae (19.3%). The outcome of 35 patients with 51 VCFs was evaluated after a mean of 13 (range 12-70) months (CT and VAS) and there was a persisting reduction of pain and no loss of reduction. In this group of patients new symptomatic fractures were evident in 4 and clinically asymptomatic (only seen on CT) fractures were detected in 5 out of 35 patients, 7 fractures were adjacent to and 2 fractures were remote from the initially treated level. In two patients an asymptomatic moderate loss of reduction was detected. These intermediate term results indicate that kyphoplasty reduces pain and improves sagittal alignment in patients with VCF. However, in 26% of patients new fractures occurred, predominantly in adjacent levels but approximately 50% of these fractures were clinically asymptomatic.",ger,0.0

OBJECTIVE: The primary study objective was to evaluate cement leakage for a cement directed kyphoplasty system (CDKS) with anteriorly biased cement flow and vertebroplasty. The secondary study objective was to compare adjacent level fracture rates and vertebral body height for these 2 intervention methods. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cement leakage remains a significant clinical problem associated with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures. Uncontrolled cement flow in the posterior direction can result in leakage into the vertebral veins or spinal canal, leading to potentially serious clinical complications. METHODS: Seventy-seven patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were enrolled. Patients were randomized 2:1 for treatment with CDKS (49 patients, 65 levels) or vertebroplasty (28 patients, 39 levels). Cement leakage was evaluated from radiographs and computed tomographic scans. Three- and 12-month follow-ups included additional radiographs and computed tomographic scans to assess changes in vertebral body height and the incidence of new fractures. RESULTS: Treatment with CDKS significantly reduced the number of levels with leaks and the total number of leaks per level, as compared with vertebroplasty (P = 0.0132 and P = 0.0012, respectively). Significantly, fewer lateral cortical and spinal canal leaks (posterior leaks) occurred in the CDKS group (P = 0.0050, P = 0.02260, respectively). Three adjacent level fractures occurred in the vertebroplasty group, as compared with 2 in the CDKS group. Vertebral body height maintenance was equivalent. CONCLUSION: Cement directed kyphoplasty effectively reduces posterior cement leakage, reducing the risk of leakage related complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.",eng,0.0

The mean visual-analogue scale (VAS) before treatment was 8.8 points (range 6.5-9.8 points). The mean VAS score after treatment was significantly reduced to 2.6 points (range 1.5-4.1 points; p<0.01). No clinical or neurological complications were documented. Minor and asymptomatic bone-cement leakage was observed in 54% of the cases. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is an efficient and safe interventional procedure which rapidly improves the mobility and quality of life of patients with vertebral compression fractures. CT-guidance is a reasonable upgrade in the treatment procedure which reduces the amount of bone-cement leakage.",eng,1.0

Routine legal personal dosimetry repeatedly showed dosimeter doses exceeding 1 mSv/month for the only radiologist performing PVP at our hospital. Based on the nature of the procedure, this raised concern about potentially high doses to the eyes and fingers. PURPOSE: To assess radiation doses to the operator, and to evaluate possibilities for dose reduction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Measurements of scattered radiation in simulated thoracic and lumbar PVP procedures were performed using two anatomical phantoms--thorax and lower trunk--and a radiation survey meter. The standard position of the operator was determined as being 50 cm from the irradiated area of the phantom. The protection ability of lead-free gloves was evaluated during the simulations. Operator doses to fingers and eyes during 10 clinical PVP procedures performed by a single operator were measured, and the annual dose was calculated. Routine personal dosimetry was performed using thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) badges beneath the lead apron, and doses to fingers and eyes were measured with small TLD tablets. RESULTS: During simulations, the measured operator dose rate arising from lateral fluoroscopy at the thorax and lumbar level was reduced by a factor of 4-5 when the X-ray tube was moved from the operator's side of the patient to the opposite side. Wearing protective gloves reduced radiation dose to the hands by 30-40%. The mean doses arising from the 10 clinical PVP procedures to the right and left hands, using protection gloves, were 2.0 mSv and 4.8 mSv, respectively. The mean dose to the eyes was 0.23 mSv. The mean effective dose to the patients was 12 mSv. CONCLUSION: Placing the X-ray tube on the side of the patient opposite to the operator and the use of radiation protection gloves significantly reduces radiation exposure to the operator. In phantom simulations, the dose was reduced by a factor of 4-5. Knowledge of fluoroscopy equipment, radiation physics, and protection is essential in order to reduce exposure.",eng,0.0

DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study. METHOD: In a pilot-study to evaluate the short-term safety and effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty, 18 consecutive patients with a total of 33 osteoporotic thoracic or lumbar vertebral compression fractures were treated from October 2001 to June 2002 with a follow-up of 3-6 months. The indication for treatment was a symptomatic, therapy-resistant osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. Percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed under radiographic control, after previous intraossal venography, using bone cement mixed with barium sulphate. Post-procedural follow-up consisted of radiological evaluation with conventional thoracolumbar X-rays and MRI scans, and interviews of the patients. RESULTS: Percutaneous vertebroplasty was technically successful in 31 of 33 vertebral fractures (94%), and in 16 of 18 patients (89%). One patient with extreme venous contrast leakage could not be treated. Sixteen patients had less or no pain after treatment. One patient retained thoracolumbar back pain after inadequate cementations and refused further treatment. None of the patients reported aggravation of symptoms following the procedure. Contrast leakage was absent in 18 vertebrae. In 8 vertebrae there was contrast leakage to paravertebral veins. In three of these cases the leakage was so severe that embolisation was performed, with success in one case. In 13 vertebrae, cement leakage to intervertebral and paravertebral spaces and pedicular cement spurs were seen, without clinical consequences. Immediately after the procedure and during follow-up there were no clinically relevant complications. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty was a technically feasible treatment in these patients with symptomatic, therapy-resistant, osteoporotic vertebral fractures. The first short-term results were comparable with results in the literature. A prospective randomised intervention study will be needed to compare percutaneous vertebroplasty with optimal conservative treatment.",dut,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients with 102 painful symptomatic VCFs were treated with PV. All patients had baseline total spinal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Follow-up MR imaging was performed at 3, 6, and 12 months to locate new VCFs. Visual analog scales for pain and pain medication consumption were used to assess clinical outcomes. The following characteristics were compared in patients with new VCFs after PV versus patients without new VCFs: patient age, sex, presence of secondary osteoporosis, bone mineral density, number of preexisting VCFs, shape and grade of VCFs, type of bone cement used for PV, volume of injected cement, and cement leakage in intervertebral disc spaces. RESULTS: Sixteen of 66 patients had 26 new VCFs during 1 year of follow-up after PV. Most new VCFs occurred within 3 months of PV, half of new VCFs appeared in levels adjacent to treated levels, and half of the new VCFs were symptomatic. The presence of more than two preexisting VCFs was the only independent risk factor for the development of a new VCF. CONCLUSIONS: New VCFs occurred after PV in 24% of patients. Half of new VCFs occurred in levels adjacent to treated levels and half were symptomatic. The presence of more than two preexisting VCFs was the only independent risk factor for the development of a new VCF.",eng,1.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain at the treated vertebral level, analgesic use, and satisfaction with outcome were assessed in 112 patients after PV of 168 VCFs. Serial follow-up was performed at 24 hours and 3, 6, and 12 months and in a small number of patients at 1-3 years. Procedure-related complications were evaluated by physical examination and computed tomography of treated levels. RESULTS: After PV, VAS scores for pain at the individual vertebral levels treated and use of analgesic agents were significantly reduced compared with before treatment at every follow-up period. Within 24 hours after the procedure, the decreases in all scores were less compared with scores at later follow-up periods, but this was not significant. The preprocedural mean VAS score was 8.8 (range, 5-10). At follow-up, mean VAS scores ranged from 2.5 to 3.3 (range, 0-10). In the short term after PV, patients used significantly less analgesic drugs and 86% of patients were satisfied with the outcome. At midterm and long-term follow-up, patients used even less analgesic drugs and 95%-100% of patients were satisfied with the outcome of PV. Procedure-related complications with clinical consequences occurred in three patients (2.7%): one patient experienced a cardiovascular reaction, one patient had a pedicle chip fracture, and one had a rib fracture. CONCLUSION: PV of painful osteoporotic VCFs provides significant pain reduction in nearly all treated patients.",eng,1.0

METHODS: Randomization of patients in 2 groups: treatment by PV or OPM. After 2 weeks, patients from the OPM arm could change therapy to PV. Patients were evaluated 1 day and 2 weeks after treatment. Visual analog score (VAS) for pain and analgesic use were assessed before, and 1 day and 2 weeks after start of treatment. Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) and Roland-Morris Disability (RMD) questionnaire scores were assessed before and 2 weeks after start of treatment. Follow-up scores in patients requesting PV treatment after 2 weeks OPM treatment were compared with scores during their OPM period. RESULTS: Eighteen patients treated with PV compared with 16 patients treated with OPM had significantly better VAS and used less analgesics 1 day after treatment. Two weeks after treatment, the mean VAS was less but not significantly different in patients treated with OPM, whereas these patients used significantly less analgesics and had better QUALEFFO and RMD scores. Scores in the PV arm were influenced by occurrence of new VCF in 2 patients. After 2 weeks OPM, 14 patients requested PV treatment. All scores, 1 day and 2 weeks after PV, were significantly better compared with scores during conservative treatment.

To clarify significance of BME in VCF, we assessed pain response after PV in patients with VCF with full BME versus patients with VCF with absent BME. METHODS: From a cohort of patients with painful VCF selected for PV, pain response in 14 patients with absent BME in VCF was prospectively compared with pain response in 31 patients with full BME in VCF. Pain was evaluated before PV and at 1 and 3 months after PV with visual analog scores and analgesics used. Back pain in general and at treated vertebral levels was assessed. RESULTS: Pain decrease after PV at treated levels was observed in 10 (71%) patients with absent BME in VCF at both follow-up periods and in 29 (94%) patients with full BME 1 month after PV and 30 (97%) at 3 months after PV. Differences between the groups were significant (P = .04 at 1 month; P = .01 at 3 months). Pain response was not affected by other patient or imaging characteristics. General back pain after PV was comparable in both groups after PV (P = .08 at 1 month; P = .4 at 3 months). CONCLUSION: Pain decrease after PV in patients with VCF is more frequently observed when full BME is present. Because 71% of patients with VCF with absent BME responded favorably on pain, PV should not be withheld based on absence of BME alone.",eng,0.0

In this study, we prospectively assessed changes in BME with MR imaging at 3, 6, and 12 months after PV and related changes in BME with pain evolution and analgesic use over time. METHODS: BME percentage was assessed in 64 patients after PV of 89 VCF with serial MR imaging follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months. Pain was assessed before PV and at every follow-up interval by visual analog scale for pain and type of analgesic used. Relation between changes in BME and pain evolution was assessed in a subgroup of 31 patients with a single treated VCF and neither new VCF at follow-up nor pain at another untreated level. RESULTS: BME gradually decreased over time. At 1 year after PV, 29% of treated VCF still demonstrated BME. Once BME disappeared, it did not return. Pain relief was most striking the first 3 months after PV and remained constant thereafter. There was no relation between relief of pain and extent, presence, or absence of BME after PV. CONCLUSION: A gradual decrease of BME in osteoporotic VCF treated with PV is apparent during 12 months of MR imaging follow-up. Decrease of BME is unrelated to relief of pain.",eng,0.0

The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of navigated percutaneous screw fixation combined with multisegmental vertebroplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic fractures not suitable for monosegmental cement augmentation in patients with severe osteoporotic changes of the vertebral column and/or progressive kyphotic deformation. METHODS: Navigated percutaneous screw fixation and simultaneous augmentation with vertebroplasty was performed in 6 patients with lumbar and 4 patients with thoracic osteoporotic fractures. In all cases, significant vertebral body collapse, destruction of the endplates and multisegmental osteoporotic changes were radiologically confirmed. Postoperative images were obtained in all cases to analyze the position of each screw and to assess further deformity progression. Follow-up ranged between 12 and 18 months. RESULTS: There was no additional morbidity associated with screw or cement insertion. Cement leakage lateral to the vertebral body was observed in 4 cases. Mean total operation time (142 minutes) was prolonged due to intraoperative data acquisition for 15+/-6 minutes. In 2 cases a second data set had to be acquired due to poor image quality. Finally, mean intraoperative blood loss was 100ml. Clinical outcome was satisfactory in all cases. Radiological follow-up demonstrated loss of initial kyphosis correction in 8 cases. CONCLUSION: Navigated percutaneous screw fixation combined with multisegmental vertebroplasty is a technically feasible procedure. Despite the additional time needed for intraoperative data acquisition, total operation time was acceptable and intraoperative blood loss as well as muscle trauma were minimized compared to a standard open procedure. Despite good clinical outcome, the described construct failed to prevent further kyphotic deformation during the reported follow-up period.",eng,0.0

Seven thoracolumbar and lumbar embalmed human cadaveric motion segments were evaluated in axial rotation, right and left lateral bending, and flexion and extension. Stiffness was calculated at baseline and following injection of 1 mL of cement into the intervertebral disk. There was a 13.4% (P=.041) increase in stiffness in axial rotation compared with preinjection motion segments. No significant difference was observed in lateral bending or flexion and extension.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the augmentation effect and extravasation risk of posterior and lateral approaches to sacroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The biomechanical stabilizing effect of sacroplasty is unknown. METHODS: Using a sacral insufficiency fracture model, we performed sacroplasty in 15 osteoporotic cadaveric pelves. Five served as controls, and 10 were each injected with 4 mL of a polymethylmethacrylate cement (5 via a posterior approach, 5 via a lateral approach). Cement extravasation was assessed using computed tomography. Restored strength and stiffness were defined as the ratios of treatment to initial strength and to stiffness, respectively. Between-group differences in restoration parameters were checked for significance (P < 0.05) using an analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. RESULTS: We found no significant differences between groups in terms of restored strength ( approximately 61%) and stiffness ( approximately 77%). Both injection methods produced extravasation into the anterior sacrum, the posterior sacrum, the sacroiliac joint, and the neural foramens. CONCLUSION: Sacroplasty with 4 mL of cement does not restore the strength or stiffness of the sacrum in a cadaveric model, regardless of the approach used.",eng,1.0

Vertebral body fractures are the most common fractures, along with fractures around the hip joint, and fractures of the distal radius due to osteoporosis. An osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture can lead to incapacitating back pain and immobility and often requires in-hospital treatment. Vertebroplasty is an effective procedure consisting of the percutaneous injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement into vertebral bodies. Preliminary studies showed promising clinical results with this new technique. As there is a high incidence of cement leakage during the injection of the cement, we prefer to perform the procedure under computed tomography control with a fluoro-CT-option. Furthermore, we recommend that the procedure is only done in collaboration with a spine surgeon. In case of a neurological complication, immediate decompression of the spinal canal is mandatory. Vertebroplasty is a very promising, effective and safe method for the treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Based on our preliminary results, this method can be recommended for a more widespread clinical use.",ger,0.0

However, due to involvement of the posterior vertebral body wall, the risk of cement leakages is considered to be higher. This study focuses on the frequency and pattern of cement leakages in AO type A3.1 fractures compared with osteoporotic compression fractures (AO type A1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis was done of all patients (n = 138) treated by BKP for osteoporotic vertebral fractures (n = 173) between January 2007 and December 2010 in our department. Cement extravasations into three pre-defined anatomical compartments were evaluated on postoperative CT scans of the augmented vertebral bodies, with even minor cement detections beyond the vertebral body's wall being strictly inidicated as leakages. The frequency of cement leakages in relation to the fracture type was statistically analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test. Clinical and radiological follow-up was done 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: The overall cement leakage rate of BKP in 173 treated osteoporotic vertebral fractures was 30.6%. Cement extravasations were detected in 20.3% of A1.1, 30.5% of A1.2, 37.8% of A1.3, and 39.0% of A3.1 fractures, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the leakage rate between A3.1 and all A1 fractures (28.0%; p > 0.05), but between A3.1 and A1.1 fractures (p < 0.05). Intraspinal cement extravasations, being the most dangerous, were seen in 25.5% of all leakages (n = 53), whereas in relation to the total number of treated fracture types, there were only 5.1% intraspinal leakages in A1.1, 5.6% in A1.2, 10.9% in A1.3, and 9.8% in A3.1 fractures. Two of 13 patients with intraspinal leakages and 1 patient with a paraaortal anterolateral cement extravasation needed surgical revisions. Two pulmonary PMMA cement embolisms were detected, but without any clinical consequences. None of the patients with cement leakages during BKP suffered from new neurological deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Cement leakages remain a problem in BKP. Although there was no significant difference between AO type A3.1 and all A1 fractures, subgroup analysis revealed a statistically significant higher risk of cement extrusions in A3.1 compared to A1.1 fractures. None of the affected patients showed new neurological deficits due to cement extravasations. Still, balloon kyphoplasty can be considered a safe procedure, even in the treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures of AO type A3.1.",eng,0.0

Kolbow,2006.0,[CT-based analysis of cement distribution in unipedicular vertebroplasty],10.1007/s00113-006-1180-8,"BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are being increasingly used in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral body fractures. Shortening the duration of operative time and radiation exposure as well as reduction of cannulation-related risks and costs are advantages of the unipedicular technique in contrast to less homogeneous cement distribution as a possible disadvantage. Biomechanical investigations have shown similar results with respect to strength and stiffness both for uni- and bipedicular vertebroplasty. Studies evaluating cement distribution with CT scans using a unipedicular approach have not been published yet. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a prospective study on 92 vertebral body fractures (Th8-L5) in 60 patients, aged 76.8 (60-95) years, which were treated by unipedicular vertebroplasty using a para-/transpedicular approach. We evaluated needle position, injected cement volume, and cement deposition based on CT scans. The vertebral body was divided into nine segments in a frontal plane view. The needle was placed in the middle third in 85.9% (79/92), in the right in 11.9% (11/92), and in the left third in 2.2% (2/92). Complications associated with cannulation were not observed. The injectable cement volume was 4.5 (1.5-9.0) ml. RESULTS: With respect to superior, middle, and inferior parts, filling of the middle third was achieved in 94.9%, of the right third in 76.1%, and of the left third in 80.4%. Only the right- and left-sided inferior segments showed a filling rate below 75%. Positioning the needle into the right or left third resulted in comparably high filling rates of the middle third (100/83.3%) but only 50.0/54.5% of the contralateral third of the vertebral body. CONCLUSION: Unipedicular vertebroplasty using a modified approach permits a reliable placement of the needle into the middle third of the vertebral body, which is the optimal position regarding cement distribution. Unipedicular vertebroplasty allows homogeneous filling and augmentation of vertebral bodies without need for a second cannulation.",ger,0.0

Difference in numbers of new fractures in the two groups at the follow-up of 12 months was also statistically insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: PVP produced better pain relief than FB in the short term (</=1 week). However, the difference in pain-relief between these two techniques was insignificant in the long term (follow-up between 1 month and 12 months).",eng,1.0

Zhao,2014.0,Basivertebral foramen could be connected with intravertebral cleft: a potential risk factor of cement leakage in percutaneous kyphoplasty,10.1016/j.spinee.2013.09.025,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Among different types of cement leakage in percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures, leaks into the spinal canal are considered to be the most common complication. One potential structure causing this type of cement leakage is the potential connection between the basivertebral foramen and the intravertebral cleft, which is revealed clearly on magnetic resonance (MR) images, but is often ignored in the literature. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence rate of different types of cement leakage in PKP with or without intravertebral clefts and to determine whether the basivertebral foramen could be connected to the intravertebral cleft. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a retrospective assessment of the presence of an intravertebral cleft in osteoporotic vertebral bodies and the different types of cement leakage after PKP on radiographs, computed tomographic (CT) scans, and MR images. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 164 consecutive patients underwent PKP to treat 204 osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures include the occurrence of different types of cement leakage in the groups with an intravertebral cleft and without intravertebral clefts. METHODS: A total of 204 vertebrae in 164 consecutive patients who underwent PKP to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were classified into two patterns based on preoperative radiographs, CT scans, and/or MR images of the treated levels: cleft pattern (with an intravertebral cleft in the vertebral body) and trabecular pattern (without intravertebral clefts). When an intravertebral cleft was identified, the investigators examined the basivertebral foramen and looked for a communication between the two structures on three-dimensional CT scans and MR images. On direct postoperative images, the patterns of cement leakage were classified as five types: type A, through a cortical defect into the paraspinal soft tissues; type B, through the basivertebral foramen; type C, via the needle channel; type D, through a cortical defect into the disc space; and type E, via the paravertebral vein. The association of the distribution of the cement leakage and the presence of an intravertebral cleft was analyzed retrospectively. Moreover, the association of type B leakage with the communication between the basivertebral foramen and the intravertebral cleft was also assessed. RESULTS: The average interobserver kappa values for determining the type of cement leakage and the presence of intravertebral cleft were 0.916 (range, 0.792-1) and 0.935, respectively. In 41 of 204 vertebrae (19.9%), an intravertebral cleft was confirmed on preoperative images. A communication between the intravertebral cleft and the basivertebral foramen was seen in 10 vertebrae (24.4%). Cement leakage was 36.2% in the group with a trabecular pattern and 41.5% in the group with a cleft pattern (p>.05). Leaks through the basivertebral foramen (type B; N=30, 14.7%) and through cortical defects into the disc space (type D; N=14, 6.9%) were more common than other types. Twenty of 163 vertebrae with the trabecular pattern (12.3%) and 10 of 41 vertebrae with the cleft pattern (24.4%) were identified as type B leaks, which reached statistical significance (p<.05). There was no statistical difference between the trabecular pattern and the cleft pattern on other types of leaks. CONCLUSIONS: Type B leaks are more common in vertebrae with an intravertebral cleft, which supports the presence of a connection between an intravertebral cleft and the basivertebral foramen. Thus, care must be taken when PKP is performed in these patients to avoid direct cement leakage into the spinal canal through the basivertebral foramen.",eng,0.0

But high cement leakage rate caused by a low-viscosity cement and high injection pressure has limited its general use. Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) and high-viscosity cement vertebroplasty (HVCV) are 2 modifications of vertebroplasty designed to decrease cement leakage. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of HVCV compared with BKP. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of Spine Surgery, an affiliated hospital of a medical university. METHOD: One hundred seven patients suffering from painful OVCFs were randomly assigned into HVCV or BKP groups. Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), cement leakage, and vertebral height restoration were evaluated. All occurring complications and injected cement volumes were recorded. The follow-up time was one year. RESULTS: VAS and ODI scores improved in both groups, and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. More cement was used in the BKP group than in HVCV group (4.22 vs. 3.31 mL, P < 0.0001). The incidence of cement leakage in the HVCV group was lower than that of the BKP group (13.24% vs 30.56%, P < 0.05). No symptomatic cement leakages occurred in the HVCV group. In the BKP group, one patient experienced discogenic back pain related to a disc leak, and another patient had asymptomatic cement emboli in the lung related to venous leakage. The mean compression rate before the procedure was 29.98% in the HVCV group and 28.67% in the BKP group (P = 0.94). The vertebral height was improved significantly and maintained at one-year follow-up in both groups. BKP was more effective in vertebral height restoration than HVCV (44.87% vs. 23.93%, P < 0.0001). There was one case of a new adjacent vertebral fracture in the HVCV group (2%), and 4 cases of new nonadjacent vertebral fractures in the BKP group (7.84%) (P = 0.18). LIMITATIONS: A single-center and relatively small-sample size study. CONCLUSION: HVCV and BKP are safe and effective in improving quality of life and relieving pain. HVCV has a lower cement leakage rate, whereas BKP is more effective in vertebral height restoration. Subsequent fractures are not different between the 2 groups.",eng,0.0

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted for 96 consecutive patients. There were 64 females and 32 males with a mean age 67 years (range: 55 - 82). Symptomatic levels were identified by correlating their clinical presentations with the findings of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The interval between onset of symptoms and surgical intervention ranged from 2 days to 4 months. A total of 118 levels (56 thoracic, 62 lumbar) were treated in this cohort. Immediate and postoperative 3-month follow-up visits were conducted. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, preoperative and postoperative anterior, midline vertebral heights for fractured vertebrae were measured on lateral radiographs to evaluate the procedural outcomes. RESULTS: There was swift pain relief associated with evident augmentation in weight-bearing resistance. Pain decreased from 8.1 to 2.1 points. Through kyphoplasty, the anterior, midline vertebral heights of 118 fractured vertebral bodies increased up to (75.83 +/- 19.84)% and (71.23 +/- 21.45)% respectively. None of them had worsening of fracture-induced narrowing of spinal canal. No device-related major complications occurred. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous kyphoplasty through an extra-pedicular approach results in immediate clinical improvement of mobility and pain relief. It safely increases vertebral body height and quickly returns geriatric patients to higher activity levels, increased independence and better quality-of-life. And its short-term outcomes are excellent.",chi,0.0

METHODS: From July 2005 to May 2010, the clinical data of 8 patients with nonunion of osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral fractures were studied. There were 3 males and 5 females, with the mean age of 73.5 years (range, 65 - 86 years). The fracture vertebrae were 3 cases in T(12), 4 in L(1), and 1 in L(2). All cases received radiography, CT and MRI examination. All patients were treated by using Kyphoplasty. Five patients were performed bone biopsy successfully, 3 patients were failed. The curative effect was evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS), anterior vertebral height restoration at preoperative, postoperative and followed-up time. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the procedure well with immediate relief of back pain after Kyphoplasty. No severe complications were found in all patients. Three cases had the pathologic appearance of sequestrum, 2 cases were sparse cancellous bone, 3 cases were abortive to biopsy. All the patients were followed up of 22.6 months (range, 3 - 37 months), the VAS was 9.5 before operation, 2.1 at the third day postoperatively, there were significant difference between the two phase (P < 0.05), and 2.3 at last follow-up, there were no difference between postoperation and follow-up phase (P > 0.05). And the height of compressed body recovered markedly. The vertebral height had a recovery rate of 67.2% postoperatively, 64.1% and at last follow-up, there were no difference between the two phase (P > 0.05).

Percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) has recently been shown to have a curative effect on OVCF. Unfortunately, related complications arising from PKP cannot be ignored, such as cement leaks, fever, and intercostal neuralgia. This study aimed to investigate the common complications of PKP in the treatment of OVCF patients and analyze the causes and assess prevention and control measures. A total of 196 patients (204 vertebrae) underwent PKP procedures at the Department of Spine Surgery, Shenzhen Sixth People's Hospital, Guangdong, China, from June 2004 to August 2010. The data on incidence rates of the various complications were compiled. All patients were successfully operated without death, paraplegia, or pulmonary embolism. Incidence of various complications resulting from different types of bone cement leakage was 27.45 %, including 0.51 % for postoperative elevated fever, 4.08 % for intercostal neuralgia, 2.55 % for trailing of bone cement, 0.51 % for refracture at adjacent vertebrae, and 0.51 % for cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

Huang,2016.0,Sequential Transarterial Embolization Followed by Percutaneous Vertebroplasty Is Safe and Effective in Pain Management in Vertebral Metastases,", ","BACKGROUND: Vertebral metastases are the most frequent vertebral tumor. Transarterial embolization (TAE) devascularizes the tumor, resulting in tumor necrosis. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), a minimally invasive procedure, can effectively relieve tumor-related pain and improve spine stability. Unfortunately, the PVP technique is of limited use in controlling the progression of vertebral tumor, especially for paravertebral metastases. TAE combined with PVP may achieve a better control on vertebral metastases with paravertebral extension, but little information regarding the combination is available. OBJECTIVES: The present study is intended to assess the safety and effectiveness of the combination of TAE and PVP in patients suffering from vertebral metastases with paravertebral extension. STUDY DESIGN: Sequential TAE followed by PVP was used in 25 patients with symptomatic vertebral metastases. The safety and effectiveness of the sequential therapy were evaluated. SETTING: Three hospitals' clinical research centers. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted with 25 consecutive patients (11 women and 14 men; mean age 59.3 years, range 38 - 80 years) with vertebral and paravertebral metastases from March 2009 to March 2014. The patients were treated with TAE, and 5 - 7 days later with the PVP procedure. The clinical outcomes were assessed by the control of pain using visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and computed tomography (CT) imaging. X2 or Fisher exact testing was performed for univariate analysis of variables. The VAS scores between groups were compared using ONE-WAY ANOVA, with a P-value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: All the TAE and PVP procedures were successfully done. Mean VAS scores decreased after TAE (from 8.64 +/- 0.58 to 5.32 +/- 1.46, P < 0.05) and further decreased after PVP (from 5.32 +/- 1.46 to 2.36 +/- 0.54, P < 0.05), and the decrease in VAS lasted until the third month (3.08 +/- 1.52, P > 0.05) follow-up. However, VAS scores at the sixth month were statistically higher than those at the third month (4.8 +/- 1.24 versus 3.08 +/- 1.52, P < 0.05), VAS scores at the twelfth month were statistically higher than those at the sixth month (6.29 +/- 1.07 versus 4.8 +/- 1.24, P < 0.05). We found paravertebral cement leakage in 6 cases. No clinical or symptomatic complications were observed. In the follow-up, no patient showed further vertebral compression or spinal canal compromise. LIMITATIONS: This is a retrospective clinical study of a small number of patients. CONCLUSION: The sequential TAE followed by PVP is safe and effective in treating vertebral metastases with paravertebral extension.

However, there is debate over which of these 2 surgical procedures can give better short-term and long-term outcomes. A lot of studies and meta-analysis were designed to assess the advantages and drawbacks of PKP and PVP in the treatment of VCFs, but most of them didn't consider the effect of VCF levels on the treatment outcome, which can influence the results. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of PKP compared to PVP in the treatment of single level osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF). STUDY DESIGN: Studies with the following criteria were included: patients with VCFs due to osteoporosis; PKP comparing PVP; study design, RCT or prospective or retrospective comparative studies. Furthermore, the studies which reported at least one of the following outcomes: subjective pain perception, quality of life evaluation, incidence of new adjacent vertebral fracture, bone cement leakage, and post-operative kyphotic angle. Articles were excluded in our meta-analysis if they had a neoplastic etiology (i.e., metastasis or myeloma), infection, neural compression, traumatic fracture, neurological deficit, spinal stenosis, severe degenerative diseases of the spine, previous surgery at the involved vertebral body, and PKP or PVP with other invasive or semi-invasive intervention treatment. SETTING: University hospital. METHODS: A systematic search of all articles published through May 2014 was performed by Medline, EMASE, OVID, and other databases. All the articles that compared PKP with PVP on single level OVCF were identified. The evidence quality levels of the selected articles were evaluated by Grade system. Data about the clinical outcomes and complications were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Eight studies, encompassing 845 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the results indicated that there were significant differences between the 2 groups in the short-term visual analog scale (VAS) scores, the long-term Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), short- and long-term kyphosis angle, the kyphosis angle improvement, the injected cement, and the cement leakage rates. However, there were no significant differences in the long-term VAS scores, the short-term ODI scores, the short- and long-term SF-36 scores, or the adjacent-level fracture rates. LIMITATIONS: Statistical efficacy can be improved by more studies, low evidence based non-RCT articles are likely to induce various types of bias, no accurate definition of short-term and long-term outcome time points. CONCLUSION: PKP and PVP are both safe and effective surgical procedures in treating OVCF. PKP has a similar long-term pain relief, function outcome (short-term ODI scores, short-and long-term SF-36 scores), and new adjacent VCFs in comparison to PVP. PKP is superior to PVP for the injected cement volume, the short-term pain relief, the improvement of short- and long-term kyphotic angle, and lower cement leakage rate. However, PKP has a longer operation time and higher material cost than PVP. To confirm this evaluation, a large multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) should be conducted.",eng,0.0

Operative time, X-ray exposure frequency and costs were recorded. The mean operative time and X-ray exposure frequency in Group A were greater than in Group B (p<0.05). Significant improvement of the VAS score was noted in each group, and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Mean increases of anterior and middle height of the fractured vertebral body were 5.14mm and 4.14mm in Group A, respectively, and 6.22mm and 5.06mm in Group B, respectively, and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p<0.05).

METHODS: Between January, 2012 and August, 2014, a total of 324 elderly patients (381 vertebrae) received percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Of these patients, 12 patients (14 vertebrae) complained of recurrence of back pain and were confirmed to have refracture in the cemented vertebrae by imaging examination. Seven of these 12 patients (9 vertebrae), who were all female with an average refracture time of 8+/-6.7 weeks (range 2-20 weeks), received conservative treatments with analgesics, osteoporosis medication, bracing and physical therapy, and their visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and Oswestry disability index (ODI) at 7 days and 1, 3 and 12 months after the treatment were measured. RESULTS: The 7 patients were followed up for 21.3+/-11.2 months (range 13-29 months) after conservative treatments. Their VAS score and ODI decreased significantly over time after the treatment (P<0.05) and showed significant differences between the measurements at 7 days, 1 and 3 months (P<0.05) but not between 3 and 12 months (P>0.05). The average VAS score and ODI before treatments were 8.3+/-0.8 and (88.3+/-3.2)%, 3.1+/-1.2 and (56.3+/-7.7)% at 1 month, and 0.8+/-0.7 and (5.9+/-2.8)% at 3 months during the follow-up, respectively.No such complications as phlebothrombosis of the leg, decubitus, or hypostatic pneumonia occurred in these cases. CONCLUSION: Though with a relatively low incidence rate, refracture in the cemented vertebrae is one of the important causes of recurrence of back pain following percutaneous vertebroplasty. Conservative treatment is effective in relieving pain and improving the spine function in such cases without obvious complications.",chi,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To compare surgeons' radiation exposure during kyphoplasty with and without the use of a remote control injection system. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Distance from radiation sources is a critical factor for reducing radiation exposure during spine surgery. A newly designed device was used to minimize operators' radiation exposure during kyphoplasty. METHODS: Forty-four patients admitted for single-level osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture were randomly divided into 2 groups (groups A and B) and treated with kyphoplasty. The remote control injection system was used only in group B. The radiation doses to the surgeon's eyes, thyroid, chest, and right wrist were recorded with 4 unprotected radiometers simultaneously. Operation time, fluoroscopic time, cement amount, patient-reported pre- and postoperative visual analogue scale scores for pain, and complications were recorded. RESULTS: For group A, the radiation doses at the eyes, thyroid, and right wrist were 1.132 +/- 0.104 mSv, 0.647 +/- 0.049 mSv, 0.578 +/- 0.056 mSv, and 1.877 +/- 0.214 mSv, respectively; for Group B, these doses were 0.257 +/- 0.067 mSv, 0.201 +/- 0.049 mSv, 0.145 +/- 0.033 mSv, and 0.353 +/- 0.046 mSv, respectively (P < 0.05). Comparisons of the radiation doses the chief surgeon and the resident surgeon received showed that the resident surgeon received more radiation during group A procedures; during group B procedures, the surgeons received similar doses. The proportion of average fluoroscopic time devoted to the bone cement injection step for groups A and B was 64% and 63%, respectively, and the average proportion of the radiation doses that were received during the bone cement injection step was 66% for group A and 36% for group B. Compared with the preoperative visual analogue scale score, the postoperative visual analogue scale score was significantly reduced in both groups. CONCLUSION: During kyphoplasty, the use of the remote control injection system can significantly reduce surgeons' radiation exposure without affecting the efficiency of procedures.",eng,0.0

METHODS: From May 2006 to October 2007, 12 patients with severe OVCF affecting more than 2/3 of the original vertebral body height were treated by using domestic PKP and percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) tool systems. There were 3 males and 9 females, with the age of 56-82 years and a mean disease course of 4.2 months (1-49 months). Eleven thoracic vertebra and 4 lumbar vertebra suffered from severe vertebral compression fractures, which included 3 extremely severe thoracic OVCF. Four thoracic vertebra and 3 lumbar vertebra had not severe OVCF. There were 4 cases of single vertebral compression fracture, 6 cases of double fractures, and 2 cases of triple fractures. Only single side PKP and PVP were performed via extrapedicular approach in thoracic vertebra, and via transpedicular approach in lumbar spine under fluoroscopic control. Eight patients with severe thoracic compression fractures and 4 with severe lumbar fractures were treated by PKP. Four patients with relatively mild thoracic compression fractures and 3 with lumbar fractures were treated by PVP. RESULTS: The operation was successfully, 3 patients with extremely severe thoracic compression fractures received no intervention. The maximum expansion pressure of balloon was (1068 +/- 298) kPa, and the volume was (3.1 +/- 1.2) mL during operation. The average operative time of PKP was (44.9 +/- 10.6) minutes per vertebra, while the average operative time of PVP was (36.5 +/- 6.8) minutes per vertebra. The average volume of injected bone cement was (2.5 +/- 0.6) mL per thoracic vertebra, and (3.6 +/- 1.2) mL per lumbar vertebra. The mean hospitalization time were (3.7 +/- 1.6) days. Twelve cases were followed up 5-18 months (mean 8.6 months). The visual analogue scale scores were (2.35 +/- 0.61) points 2 days after operation and (2.89 +/- 1.07) points at last follow-up, there were statistically significant differences when compared with before operation (8.27 +/- 1.36) points (P < 0.01). Extravertebral leakage of the bone cement into the paravertebral tissue and/or disc occurred in 6 patients (9 vertebra) without significant symptom.

Frequently observed complications are fractures of adjacent and augmented vertebrae. In the present work, mechanisms for these fractures are presented. Fresh 4-level osteoporotic thoracic motion segments were tested. Both ends of the specimen were mounted. The lower level of the free vertebra was compressively fractured and followed by an injection of a 3.5 mL of a PMMA bone cement. Three steps of fatigue loading (5 Hz for 5 h) were incrementally and vertically applied on the specimens from 650 N to 950 N to 1150 N. Specimens of intact, compressively fractured, cement augmented and post-fatigued loading were radiographed for the measurement of deformations of the vertebra, the canal, and the foramen. At the end of fatigue loading, the vertebrae were sliced for micro morphologic analysis. The largest height loss after fatigue loading was at the posterior region of the augmented vertebra. In the augmented vertebra, fissures were found along the bone-cement interface. These fissures split the cement and the trabeculae and propagated into the vertebrae and the endplates. The compactness ratio of the trabeculae region of the adjacent cranial vertebra was higher than that for intact and adjacent caudal ones. We attribute the fracture of the augmented vertebra, following simulated VP, to the initiation of fissures along the cement-bone interface, which, in turn, may be due to uneven deformation of the vertebra. Fracture of the adjacent cranial vertebra is attributed to collapse of its trabeculae.",eng,0.0

A preliminary hypotheses is that cement injection exaggerates force transmission to the adjacent vertebral bodies, thereby predisposing those levels to future fractures. A sandwich vertebra is an intact vertebral body located between 2 previously cemented vertebrae. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the risk of adjacent-level fracture increased due to load shift after a cement injection procedure. The authors retrospectively investigated the rate of adjacent-level fracture after sandwiching compared with conservative treatment and determined the potential causative factors of sandwich vertebral fracture. Age, sex, weight, height, body mass index, follow-up period, and location of sandwich level (T10-L2 or nonT10-L2 junction) were assessed. Surgical variables, including surgical procedure (vertebroplasty or balloon kyphoplasty), surgical approach (through uni- or bilateral pedicle), volume of cement injected into the painful vertebrae, cement leakage into the intervertebral disk, cumulative number of treated levels, and pre- and postoperative kyphotic angulation of the sandwich region, were also analyzed. Nine of 42 sandwiched levels developed fatigue fractures, whereas 11 of 71 patients treated with conservative therapy sustained new vertebral fractures adjacent to the treated levels. Only preoperative kyphotic angulation was the variable positively associated with sandwich vertebral fracture at follow-up (P=.021). Although subjected to double load shifts, the sandwich vertebra was not prone to structural failure. Thus, cement augmentation protocol does not increase the incidence of adjacent vertebral fracture.",eng,1.0

Lumbar TB is a destructive form of TB. Antituberculous treatment should be started as early as possible. In some circumstances, however, surgical debridement with or without stabilization of the spine appears to be beneficial and may be recommended. Surgeries through the approach of anterior or posterior are still challenging and often involve some complications. PATIENT CONCERNS: The case is a 68-year-old female who was misdiagnosed as simple vertebral compression fracture and underwent L1 and L2 percutaneous vertebroplasty in another hospital 7 years ago. He complained of lumbosacral pain for 1 month this time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) showed intervertebral space in L1/2 was seriously damaged like TB. DIAGNOSES: Lumbar tuberculosis INTERVENTIONS:: Antitubercular drugs, mini-invasive debridement with XLIF in combination with percutaneous pedicle screwsfixation was performed. This patient was followed up for 12 months. OUTCOMES: No obvious complication occurred during the operation and the wound healed well. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI: 56 vs 22) and visual analog scale (VAS: 4 vs 0) score significantly decreased atfinal follow-up of 12 months. Obvious recovery of kyphosis angle was found postoperatively (post: 14.8 degrees vs pre: 33.5 degrees ). No recurrent infection occurred at the last follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anatomical feasibility of percutaneous kyphoplasty for lumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures via a unilateral transverse process-pedicle approach (TPA). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Kyphoplasty via a unilateral approach has been reported and good clinical results have been achieved. However, because of the lack of an anatomical study, these approaches have yet to be popularized. METHODS: A total of 150 lumbar vertebral bodies of 30 patients were simulated kyphoplasty on the computed tomographic scans through conventional transpedicle approach (CTA) and the TPA, respectively. Anatomical parameters including the distance between the entry point and the midline of the vertebral body, the puncture inclination angle, and the success rate of puncture were measured and compared. RESULTS: The distance between the entry point and the midline from L1 to L5 lumbar levels varied from 20.6 +/- 2.2 mm to 28.6 +/- 2.9 mm in the CTA group and from 23.6 +/- 2.2 mm to 33.6 +/- 2.9 mm in the TPA group. The entry point from L1 to L5 in the TPA group was 3.0 +/- 2.1 mm to 5.1 +/- 2.7 mm more lateral than that in the CTA group. The medial inclination angles from L1 to L5 were 30.2 degrees +/- 6.4 degrees to 47.7 degrees +/- 5.4 degrees in the TPA and 15.3 degrees +/- 6.0 degrees to 22.8 degrees +/- 8.7 degrees in the CTA group. The inclination angles in the TPA group were greater than that in the CTA group and the safe range of the puncture angles was also wider. The success rate was 51.7% in the CTA group and 87.7% in the TPA group. CONCLUSION: The entry point through a TPA was localized at the midline of the transverse process, 3.0 to 5.1 mm outside the lateral margin of the pedicle projection. Compared with CTA, the puncture inclination angle in the TPA approach was much larger with a wider safe puncture range. The TPA approach allowed an easy puncture to meet or surpass the midline of the lumbar vertebral body. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.",eng,0.0

METHODS: A total of 28 freshly frozen human vertebrae specimens were randomly divided into 4 groups. After the measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral height, each vertebra received an axle load by a MTS (material testing system) machine to test the initial strength and stiffness. Subsequently a simultaneous compressive fracture model was created to measure the stiffness and height of fractured vertebrae. Then the augmentation procedure was performed. Afterward the biomechanical properties and the vertebral height were similarly measured as pre-operatively. The expansion of bone filling container and the distribution of cement within vertebral body were morphologically observed by crossing the specimens in sagittal midline and also integrated with the radiographic results. RESULTS: Stiffness was significantly restored comparing with that of fractured level (P < 0.05). And the bipedicular groups had better restoration results than the unipedicular groups. The strength and height of specimens significantly increased after the augmentation procedure but without difference among groups. In axial radiographic view, the distribution of cement in vertebral body was oval or long oval-shaped in double-layer bone filling container groups while it was irregular in single-layer groups. After crossing, the double-layer version expanded well in vertebral body and could enwrap most of injected cement. There was only a little leakage near the vessel layer. But the single-layer version had a poor expansion and a large amount of cement leakage. CONCLUSION: This novel reticulate bone void filling container system with different layers may restore both the biomechanical properties and the height of fractured vertebrae. But, with the benefit of reducing cement leakage, a double-layer design can enwrap most of injected PMMA and has a brighter prospect of clinical application.",chi,0.0

Journal Article,Y. Wang; F. Huang; L. Chen; Z. Y. Ke; Z. L. Deng,2013.0,Clinical measurement of intravertebral pressure during vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty,", ","BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are emerging procedures for almost immediate pain relief when treating osteoporotic or osteolytic fractures. The main reported complication is polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) leakage, which may lead to compression of neural structures or embolism. Different authors have proposed that intravertebral pressure (IP) is an important factor determining the risk for leakage, although so far only limited information has been gathered from clinical and experimental studies. There is also a lack of understanding of the IP during conventional interventions in VP and KP in the clinic. OBJECTIVE: (1) To compare the intravertebral pressures of compressed vertebrae and adjacent normal vertebrae. (2) To measure the IP of compressed vertebrae during VP and KP. SETTING: An interventional pain management practice, a medical center, major metropolitan city, in the People's Republic of China. METHODS: Thirty-five patients (with 40 compressed vertebrae and 35 adjacent normal vertebrae) were randomly allocated for intravertebral pressure measurements. Cannulas were placed bipedicularly into the posterior third of each vertebral body. Either PMMA or a balloon was injected into the vertebral body through the right cannula. A manometer was connected to the cannula in the left pedicle, and heparin was injected to verify the pressure measurement system. RESULTS: The range (minimum-maximum), average IP, and the standard deviation of the compressed vertebrae were 0-39 mm Hg and 24.5 +/-11.3 mm Hg; and that of adjacent normal vertebrae were 3-16 mm Hg, 7.3 +/- 4.2 mm Hg. Furthermore, the average IP for Phase 1 (before PMMA injection) for VP was 23 +/-11.9 mm Hg; the maximum IP recorded during injection was 169 +/- 46.8 mm Hg and the IP for 10 minutes after injection was 33 +/-9.4 mm Hg. Meanwhile, the highest IP recorded for KP patients was 142 +/-39.6 mm Hg. The average IP for Phase 1 (before balloon inflation) was 24 +/-12.7 mmHg; Phase 2 (peak IP during the balloon inflation) was 63 +/- 25.8 mm Hg; and Phase 3 (after balloon inflation/before PMMA injection) was , and 18 +/- 10.8 mm Hg. The IP for 10 minutes after injection in KP patients was 36 +/- 8.5 mm Hg. LIMITATIONS: The flow rate was manually controlled, which is in line with clinical routine, and was kept at approximately 0.1 mL/s. Because the speed of injection was controlled by hand, an exact injection rate could not be assured, leading to some inaccuracy when comparing the IP of VP and KP patients. Each patient was injected with a different PMMA volume. Because PMMA injection was performed to a satisfactory vertebral body filling and limited by any signs of extravasation, it was difficult to maintain a constant injection volume, unlike in vitro studies. Other factors such as the damage to the vertebral shell or the degree of osteoporosis might also have affected the intravertebral pressure. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the IP of compressed vertebrae was significantly higher than that of adjacent normal vertebrae. There was a significant increase in IP during the PMMA filling in VP and KP; the IP of compressed vertebrae was not significantly reduced by the balloon inflation in KP, and no statistically significant differences in IP were found during all common stages of PMMA filling in VP and KP.",eng,0.0

We report our experience for 81 kyphoplasty procedures performed in 45 patients with thoracic and lumbar vertebral lesions caused by metastases. 4 out of the 45 patients were withdrawn at 1-year follow-up. 41 patients demonstrated good clinical result. The osteoblastic group performed a better pain relief in visual analog scale (VAS) score after the treatment than the osteoclastic group 3 days, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year after the KP. And the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores of the osteoblastic group is lower than that of the osteoclastic group just in 3 days after the KP. And there were no significant difference between the two groups of ODI scores 1 month, 3 month and 1 year after the KP. And there were no statistical differences of the radiographic parameters including VB height variation and local kyphosis angle (LKA) between the two groups. Kyphoplasty results in an effective, minimally invasive procedure for the stabilization of thoracic and lumbar metastatic vertebral lesions, including both osteoblastic and osteoclastic types, which achieves statistically significant pain relief, function improvement, preventing further local kyphotic deformity, and VB height.",eng,0.0

Mao,2014.0,Adjacent-level symptomatic fracture after percutaneous vertebral augmentation of osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture: a retrospective analysis,10.1007/s00776-014-0610-7,"BACKGROUND: Vertebral augmentation is an effective and minimally invasive procedure that is used extensively worldwide for the treatment of osteoporosis vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). New pain from adjacent vertebra fracture (AVF) after initial cement augmentation has gradually been given attention, but the exact causes of AVF are still controversial. The purpose of this study was to analyze the associated incidence, risk factors, and possible causative mechanism of symptomatic AVF, and to evaluate the intrinsic relationship between cement leakage into the disk and AVF. METHODS: Three hundred and fifty-eight patients (271 women, 87 men; mean age 70.5 +/- 9.1 years; range 42-91 years) undergoing vertebral augmentation for their single level of OVCFs were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into AVF (n = 26) and AVF-free (n = 332) groups, and the groups were compared with respect to preoperative and perioperative parameters, as well as postoperative results. Potential risk factors were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The rate of symptomatic AVF was 7.3%. The majority of symptomatic AVF, 57.7% of which developed 6 months after the procedures, were located mainly in the thoraco-lumbar vertebra. Significant differences were found between the AVF and AVF-free groups with regard to age, bone mineral density (BMD), and intravertebral clefts (p < 0.05). AVF occurred in six of 28 patients with intravertebral clefts, and five of them developed AVF within 6 months after the procedure. No statistically significant association was observed in the correlation between intradiscal cement leakage and the incidence of symptomatic AVF (p = 0.390). CONCLUSIONS: Older age, lower BMD, and intravertebral clefts are the main risk factors for symptomatic AVF after vertebral augmentation, but intradiscal cement leakage does not increase the risk of AVF. AVF occurs because of the natural progression of osteoporosis. Even distribution of bone cement in the vertebral body is important in OVCF patients with intravertebral clefts.",eng,1.0

We assessed the efficacy and safety of the procedure. METHODS: Adults with one to three acute vertebral fractures were eligible for enrolment in this randomised controlled trial at 21 sites in eight countries. We randomly assigned 300 patients by a computer-generated sequence to receive kyphoplasty treatment (n=149) or non-surgical care (n=151). The primary outcome was the difference in change from baseline to 1 month in the short-form (SF)-36 physical component summary (PCS) score (scale 0-100) between the kyphoplasty and control groups. Quality of life and other efficacy measurements and safety were assessed up to 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00211211. FINDINGS: 138 participants in the kyphoplasty group and 128 controls completed follow-up at 1 month. By use of repeated measures mixed effects modelling, all 300 randomised participants were included in the analysis. Mean SF-36 PCS score improved by 7.2 points (95% CI 5.7-8.8), from 26.0 at baseline to 33.4 at 1 month, in the kyphoplasty group, and by 2.0 points (0.4-3.6), from 25.5 to 27.4, in the non-surgical group (difference between groups 5.2 points, 2.9-7.4; p<0.0001). The frequency of adverse events did not differ between groups. There were two serious adverse events related to kyphoplasty (haematoma and urinary tract infection); other serious adverse events (such as myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism) did not occur perioperatively and were not related to procedure.

During BKP, cannulae are placed percutaneously into the vertebral body, allowing insertion of inflatable balloons. Inflating the balloons partially restores vertebral body height, compacts the bone and creates a cavity for placement of bone cement after balloon removal. Placement of the cement reduces and stabilizes the fracture. BKP differs from vertebroplasty in that it aims to restore vertebral height and reduce kyphotic deformity. Case reports and observational studies have consistently shown that BKP significantly reduces pain, increases mobility and functional capacity and improves quality of life for up to 3 years. Clinically significant adverse events have been rarely reported. These findings were confirmed in randomized and nonrandomized prospective controlled studies.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the technical feasibility and the safety of additional cement augmentation of anterior cervical implants in patients with poor bone quality because of osteoporosis or tumor infiltration. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: With an increasing number of elderly patients in spinal surgery the problem of implant dislocation after cervical instrumentation will become a more and more important problem. Whereas in the thoracolumbar area cement augmented screws have become widely accepted to ensure a rigid fixation in patients with reduced bone quality there are no data concerning an additional intravertebral cement augmentation after cervical plating. METHODS: Nine patients (4 males, 5 females, mean age 62.8 y) with newly diagnosed fractures of 1 or 2 cervical vertebrae because of tumor infiltration (6 cases) or osteoporosis (3 cases) were included in our study. A standard 1-level or 2-level cervical corpectomy with vertebral body replacement by an in situ expandable titanium cage and additional anterior plating was carried out. After this, additional cement augmentation was performed as a vertebroplasty of the anterior two thirds of the cranial and caudal adjacent vertebra by a new anterior hole. The cement should enclose the screws and stabilize the endplates of the adjacent vertebrae. Follow-up comprised clinical examinations, SF-36 questionnaire and visual analog scale 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Cervical spine radiographs were obtained 3 and 6 months after surgery and computed tomography scans 6 and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 10 months with a range of 4-18 months. There was no intraoperative cement leakage into the spinal canal. The visual analog scale decreased from 8.2 to 4.2 at 6 months, physical and mental component summaries of SF-36 increased significantly from 27.7 to 36.1 and 31.5 to 48.6 at 6 months, respectively. Loosening of screws or plates was not detected throughout the whole observation period. There was 1 subsidence of a titanium cage into an adjacent vertebra without any clinical consequences. There was no adjacent fracture during the follow-up period and other surgical interventions or revisions were not necessary in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe osteoporosis or in patients with advanced tumor disease, excellent surgical, clinical, and radiologic results are possible following our method. In our opinion, a second-step posterior approach can be avoided by this technique.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,N. B. Watts,2001.0,Osteoporotic vertebral fractures,", ","Osteoporosis is a significant public health problem. Vertebral fractures are the most common fracture in patients with osteoporosis, occurring in approximately 750,000 cases each year. The fractures may cause acute or chronic pain, reduce the quality of life, and shorten life expectancy. Several medications are available that reduce the risk of fracture. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty (balloon-inflated expansion of collapsed vertebrae followed by injection of bone cement) may reduce or relieve pain in selected patients. Although surgery is rarely necessary for the management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures, it may be indicated for other reasons. No studies have been conducted to determine if the outcome of spinal fusion is different in patients with osteoporosis and, if it is, whether management of the patient's osteoporosis will improve the outcome.",eng,0.0

Genant,2001.0,Treatment of painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures with percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty,10.1007/s001980170086,"Vertebral fracture is the most common complication of osteoporosis. It results in significant mortality and morbidity, including prolonged and intractable pain in a minority of patients. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, procedures that involve percutaneous injection of bone cement into a collapsed vertebra, have recently been introduced for treatment of osteoporotic patients who have prolonged pain (several weeks or longer) following vertebral fracture. To determine the details of the procedures and to gather information on their safety and efficacy, we performed a MEDLINE search using the terms 'vertebroplasty' and 'kyphoplasty.' We reviewed reports of these procedures in patients with osteoporosis. We supplemented the articles found with other papers known to the authors and with presentations at national meetings. Randomized trials of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have not been reported. Case reports suggest that these procedures are associated with pain relief in 67% to 100% of cases. Short-term complications, mainly the result of extravasation of cement, include increased pain and damage from heat or pressure to the spinal cord or nerve roots. Proper patient selection and good technique should minimize complications, but rarely, decompressive surgery is needed. Long-term benefits have not yet been shown, but potentially include prevention of recurrent pain at the treated level(s) with both procedures, and, with kyphoplasty, reversal of height loss and spinal deformity, an improved level of function, and avoidance of chronic pain and restriction of internal organs. Possible long-term complications, again not fully evaluated, include local acceleration of bone resorption caused by the treatment itself or by foreign-body reaction at the cement-bone interface, and increased risk of fracture in treated or adjacent vertebrae through changes in mechanical forces. Controlled trials are needed to determine both short-term and long-term safety and efficacy of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Both procedures may be useful for osteoporotic patients who have prolonged pain following acute vertebral fracture. Until there is conclusive evidence for efficacy and long-term safety, these procedures should be done only in carefully selected patients, only by experienced operators with appropriate high-quality imaging equipment, and ideally at centers that are participating in controlled trials.",eng,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2002 - 2005 69 patients (101 vertebrae) were treated with vertebroplasty (n = 82) or kyphoplasty (n = 19) using 4-slice MSCT with CT fluoroscopy as the sole guidance for the procedure. The underlying lesions were osteoporotic fractures in 78 vertebral bodies and 23 vertebral metastases. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all 101 procedures. Post-interventional CT demonstrated asymptomatic cement leakage in 51/101 vertebrae. Kyphoplasty resulted in leakage in 11/19 (57.9 %) and vertebroplasty in 40/82 (48.8 %) procedures. With p = 0.48 (Mann-Whitney Test) there was no significant difference between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty with respect to the number of cement leakage occurrences. There was one minor complication of an L5 root irritation following radiofrequency ablation and vertebroplasty of a sarcoma metastasis which subsided without treatment after 8 weeks. There was one major complication of intraspinal cement leakage during tumor vertebroplasty causing T5 root compression and requiring laminectomy for cement removal. The overall rate of major complications requiring treatment was 0.99 %. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can be safely performed using only MSCT fluoroscopy guidance. The rate of major complications is very low. There was a high rate of small asymptomatic cement leakages which may have remained undetected with conventional fluoroscopy (CF). There was no statistically significant advantage for kyphoplasty with respect to cement leakage and the technical success rate.,ger,0.0

These procedures are quickly performed with few personnel and material resources and have a low rate of complications. However, cases of neurological impairment are reported in the scientific literature. We analysed whether potentially harmful heat is radiated/conducted by the polymerisation temperature of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement in the spinal canal. METHODS: We performed vertebroplasty on 25 vertebral bodies and measured the temperature distribution during polymerisation of bone cement within the spinal canal using heat probes placed in the respective areas. The vertebral bodies were located in a circulating water bath at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: During polymerisation of the bone cement, a temperature rise was measured. The peak temperature was reached after few minutes. Temperature curves differed; a maximum temperature of up to 43.16 degrees C was detected for a few seconds only. CONCLUSION: When vertebroplasty is performed correctly, there is no temperature development that could eventually damage the spinal cord or spinal nerves.",eng,1.0

Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage has now been developed to provide initial stability before fusion; however, whether and how ACDF with PEEK cage offer better clinical results compared with ACDF with plating in management of Hangman's fracture remains unknown. This study compares the efficacy of ACDF with plating to that of ACDF with PEEK cage in management of type II/IIA Hangman's fractures (according to Levine and Edwards classification) retrospectively. METHODS: From February 2006 to March 2012, a total of 21 patients with type II/IIA Hangman's fractures combined with intervertebral disc injury underwent ACDF with PEEK cage, and 28 patients underwent ACDF with plating. Perioperative parameters were compared. The average follow-up period was 50.3 months (range 27-76 months). The clinical outcome (visual analog scale (VAS), American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scale, and clinical post-traumatic neck score (PTNC)) and radiological outcome (translation of C2, local kyphotic angle (LKA), and fusion status of C2/3) was compared retrospectively. RESULTS: The operative time and blood loss were significantly less in the ACDF with cage group compared with that in the ACDF with plating group (P < 0.05). All patients showed neurological recovery and achieved solid fusion. There were no significant differences in the clinical and radiological outcomes at final follow-up between groups, except in the LKA and the correction loss rate of LKA which were higher in the ACDF with plating group (P < 0.05). Donor-site pain occurred in two patients (10.1%) within 6 months after operation in the ACDF with plating group and none in the ACDF with cage group. All patients recovered without any adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: ACDF with PEEK cage is effective and reliable in management of type II/IIA Hangman's fractures and is more cost-effective due to shorter operative time and less blood loss requirements.",eng,0.0

METHODS: A retrospective review (from March 2003 to October 2012) was conducted on 685 consecutive patients, a total of 885 vertebrae were involved. Eighty-two cases (99 vertebrae) with bone cement leakage when less than 0.3 ml bone cement was injected to fill the fracture were given PVP procedure by unilateral multiple channels approach. 38 cases were male (45 vertebrae) and 44 cases were female (54 vertebrae). The average age was 75.4 years old (from 69 to 92). The operation time, amount of injected bone cement and complications were recorded. Rate of excellent and good outcomes was studied by measuring the cement distribution on the X-ray film. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score and Oswestry disability index (ODI) system were used to evaluate the pain relief and improvement of daily activity function respectively at preoperation and 1 hour, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after operation. RESULTS: All these ninety-nine vertebrae were treated in 82 cases with PVP of unilateral multiple channels approach. The average operation time was 33 minutes. The rate of excellent and good outcomes of cement distribution was 98.8%. The VAS score was (8.40 +/- 0.73) before surgery,and (2.50 +/- 0.43), (2.00 +/- 0.33), (1.80 +/- 0.28), (2.10 +/- 0.17) at 1 hour, 1 month,3 months and 6 months respectively after operation.

The differences of the VAS and ODI between pre-operation and post-operation had statistical significance (P<0.01). No spine or nerve injuries occurred intraoperatively. CONCLUSION: The unilateral multiple channels approach in percutaneous vertebroplasty can obviously relieve the pain and effectively improve the functional activity, provide a satisfied cement distribution in vertebral body with cement leakage after a small amount infusion.",chi,0.0

Curative or curettage surgery, such as vertebrectomy and reconstruction, is currently the main method of treatment. In certain situations however, such as a patient's poor condition, multi-level involvement, or a limited life expiration, major surgery is not recommended.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new method of open vertebroplasty (OVP) in the treatment of VB metastasis and to investigate the indications for, limitations of, and the result of this new procedure.
METHODS: Between May 2007 and May 2010, the authors treated 18 patients with VB metastasis disease by OVP. Patients consisted of 12 men and 6 women with a mean age of 53 years. All patients suffered severe back pain preoperatively (mean VAS score of 6.82). Spinal cord compression resulted in eight and isolated radicular compression occurred in three of the 18 patients. In these 18 patients, 28 vertebral levels were treated: three levels in 3 patients; two levels in 4 patients; and one level in the remaining 11 patients. OVP was used accompanied by vertebral fixation or medullary compression.
RESULTS: The mean duration of the OVP procedure was 37 min. Blood loss ranged from 50 to 150 ml. In all patients, pain improved within seven days after the intervention, and the mean VAS score decreased to 2.31. Patients who suffered from neurological dysfunction preoperatively improved in Frankel degree (the result of spinal cord decompression). Most patients reached an excellent score, according to the Modified MacNab Criteria. Postoperative radiography revealed cement leaks into pulmonary veins in one case. After OVP or PVP, all patients underwent radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: OVP has a comprehensive application in metastasis spinal column disease, being easily performed and accompanied by few complications. Importantly, this procedure allows decompression of the spinal cord and consolidation of the VB, thus stabilizing the vertebral column. Results from the clinic demonstrate that patients experience pain relief and neural function recovery following the OVP procedure.

Most frequently, osteoporotic fractures (VP, KP) and metastases (VP) are treated in highly selected patients. These methods consist of polymethylmethacrylat (PMMA) injection into the VB usually through transpedicular canulas. In KP a coaxial balloon creates a cavity within the vertebral body, thus restoring some of the original VB height before cement injection. Consistently, these methods result in favourable outcomes.

These patients need immediate restabilisation of the vertebral body to eliminate the pain generator, to prevent further crushing, and to reduce the comorbidity of prolonged immobilisation. Vertebroplasty combined with pedicular instrumentation is presented as a therapy for a selected group of such patients. Eight patients with an average age of 69.1 years experienced significant relief from disabling back pain. The ability to ambulate increased significantly. The risks associated with prolonged bed rest and hospital stay were reduced. There were only minor surgical complications. Follow-up was short because of the limited life expectancy of these severely ill patients. Disabling back pain was successfully treated and ongoing vertebral body collapse was prevented by vertebroplasty combined with pedicular instrumentation in the eight selected osteoporosis and cancer patients.",English,0.0

Simmen,2013.0,Vertebral body stenting versus kyphoplasty for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: a randomized trial,10.2106/jbjs.l.00024,"BACKGROUND: In the treatment of vertebral compression fractures, vertebral body stenting with an expandable scaffold inserted before application of the bone cement was developed to impede secondary loss of vertebral height encountered in patients treated with balloon kyphoplasty. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether there are relevant differences between balloon kyphoplasty and vertebral body stenting with regard to perioperative and postoperative findings. METHODS: In a two-armed randomized controlled trial, patients with a total of 100 fresh osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were treated with either balloon kyphoplasty or vertebral body stenting. The primary outcome was the post-interventional change in the kyphotic angle on radiographs. The secondary outcomes were the maximum pressure of the balloon tamp during inflation, radiation exposure time, perioperative complications, and cement leakage. RESULTS: The mean reduction (and standard deviation) of kyphosis (the kyphotic correction angle) was 4.5 degrees +/- 3.6 degrees after balloon kyphoplasty and 4.7 degrees +/- 4.2 degrees after vertebral body stenting (p = 0.972). The mean pressures were 24 +/- 5 bar (348 +/- 72 pounds per square inch [psi]) during vertebral body stenting and 16 +/- 6 bar (233 +/- 81 psi) during balloon kyphoplasty (p = 0.014). There were no significant differences in radiation exposure time.None of the patients underwent revision surgery, and postoperative neurologic sequelae were not observed. Cement leakage occurred at twenty-five of the 100 vertebral levels without significant differences between the two intervention arms (p = 0.230). Intraoperative material-related complications were observed at one of the fifty vertebral levels in the balloon kyphoplasty group and at nine of the fifty levels in the vertebral body stenting group. CONCLUSIONS: No beneficial effect of vertebral body stenting over balloon kyphoplasty was found among patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures with regard to kyphotic correction, cement leakage, radiation exposure time, or neurologic sequelae. Vertebral body stenting was associated with significantly higher pressures during balloon inflation and more material-related complications.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To convey the mechanism of venous air embolism (VAE) during percutaneous spinal procedures and its proper identification and management. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous spinal procedures such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are commonplace techniques employed to alleviate back pain for compression fractures. VAE is a real and likely underappreciated phenomenon that is important to recognize. METHODS: A case report is used to illustrate the clinical scenario of VAE during vertebroplasty performed for a T9 compression fracture. RESULTS: The rapid sumping of fluid and air was identified during the procedure and believed to be due to a large air/venous interface within the trabecular bone. The needle was capped and no undue harm occurred to the patient. CONCLUSION: VAE is a complication with associated morbidity and mortality from percutaneous procedures for the treatment of compression fractures. An understanding of the causes, prevention, identification, and management when it occurs will serve to improve patient care and reduce morbidity.",eng,0.0

The first purpose of the present study, therefore, was to investigate the effects of sacroplasty on pain, mobility, and activities of daily living (ADLs). A second purpose was to compare clinical outcomes of sacroplasty with those of vertebroplasty, a similar but more established procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case series of 12 patients who had a sacroplasty and a control group of 21 patients who had undergone a vertebroplasty was conducted. A 12-item questionnaire and subsequent telephone interview requested each patient to rate the intensity of pain, as well as the ability to ambulate and perform ADLs, before sacroplasty or vertebroplasty, and at the time of the interview. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in overall self-reported pain, as well as an increase in self-reported ability to ambulate and perform ADLs after sacroplasty or vertebroplasty. These improvements were equivalent, regardless of which procedure the patient received. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that the treatment of sacral insufficiency fractures with sacroplasty produces relatively long-lasting improvements in pain, mobility, and the ability to perform ADLs. These data also suggest that the clinical outcomes of sacroplasty are comparable with those of vertebroplasty, an accepted and more routinely performed procedure.",eng,1.0

Morris,2007.0,Investigating sacroplasty: technical considerations and finite element analysis of polymethylmethacrylate infusion into cadaveric sacrum,10.3174/ajnr.A0500,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sacroplasty is not as routinely performed as vertebroplasty, possibly due to technical challenges and the paucity of data regarding subsequent outcomes. The first goal of the present investigation was to describe a technique for sacroplasty that facilitates safe needle placement and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) extrusion. The second goal was to perform finite element analysis (FEA) by using a geometric model of sacral fracture to identify mechanical outcomes of sacroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sacroplasty was performed on fresh pelvis specimens (n=4) under biplane fluoroscopy. Cadavers were imaged via CT before and after sacroplasty and volume rendered to examine needle placement and PMMA extrusion. The volume-rendered CT data were then used to generate geometric models of the intact, fractured, and cement-augmented fractured sacrum for comparison by using FEA. RESULTS: CT data demonstrate that safe injection needle placement and PMMA delivery may be facilitated by orienting the needle parallel to the L5-S1 interspace and ipsilateral sacroiliac joint, then targeting the superolateral sacral ala within an area bounded by a line lateral to the posterior foraminal openings and a line superimposed on the medial edge of the sacroiliac joint. FEA revealed that simulated sacroplasty decreased maximal principal stress at the point of sacral fracture propagation by 83% and fracture gap micromotion by 48%. CONCLUSION: Sacral landmarks can be used to place PMMA safely where sacral fractures occur. FEA suggests that sacroplasty may decrease fracture-associated mechanical stress and micromotion, which may contribute to patient reports of decreased pain and increased mobility postsacroplasty.",eng,1.0

A new MRI-visible bone cement was developed through the addition of a contrast agent and either a saline solution or a hydroxyapatite (Wichlas et al., 2010). The purposes of the study were to examine the influence of the two MRI-signal-inducing cements on the biomechanical behavior of cadaveric osteoporotic vertebral bodies after vertebroplasty and to compare the performance of the cements with conventional polymethylmethacrylate cement. METHODS: Three different cements were used: standard polymethylmethacrylate cement and two modified MRI-signal-inducing cements that were mixed with either a 0.9% saline solution or a hydroxyapatite. The modulus of elasticity for the standard polymethylmethacrylate cement was 2040MPa, and the moduli for the MRI-signal-inducing cements that were mixed with a 0.9% saline solution and a hydroxyapatite were 1477 and 1225MPa, respectively. The lumbar vertebral bodies from nine osteoporotic spines (mean age=87 years, range=78-99 years) of female cadavers were examined. Three groups were formed: polymethylmethacrylate cement with saline solution (n=14), polymethylmethacrylate cement with hydroxyapatite (n=12) and polymethylmethacrylate cement (n=13). The vertebral bodies were biomechanically tested before and after vertebroplasty. Stiffness was chosen as the primary biomechanical parameter. FINDINGS: The vertebral body stiffness was nearly two-fold greater after vertebroplasty, and this increase was statistically significant for every group. All the groups had similar vertebral body stiffness value before and after the vertebroplasty. The UNIANOVA test for multivariate analysis of variance showed no influence of lumbar level, injected cement volume and initial vertebral body stiffness. INTERPRETATION: The elastic moduli of the cements appear to exert little influence on the biomechanical values when the cement is in the vertebral body. Based on the direct comparison with the classic polymethylmethacrylate cement, we believe that the implementation of such cements for MRI-guided vertebroplasties is feasible.",eng,1.0

Furthermore, we analysed clinical and radiological results 4 weeks and one year after balloon kyphoplasty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between April 2007 and December 2008, 68 patients with 77 vertebral fractures were allocated to kyphoplasty. All patients could be evaluated 4 weeks after the operation and 50 patients (74%) for the one-year follow-up. In all patients conventional radiographs of the spine were performed. Persisting or increasing pain after one week led to an MRI. Under consideration of the pain situation and the result of the MRI a balloon kyphoplasty was performed. RESULTS: In 19 patients (25.3%) a cement leakage without any neurological symptoms was observed. After the operation we did not find any neurological disturbances, infection or haematoma. 13 thoracic spine fractures (38%) and 21 lumbar spine fractures (51%) could not be detected with conventional X-rays and could be observed only with the MRI. Preoperatively the kyphosis angle was measured with 13.3 degrees , 4 weeks after the operation it was 5.2 degrees (p = 0.001) and one year after the surgical procedure 4.8 degrees . After kyphoplasty, the compression index was improved with 26% (p </= 0.001). Using the visual analogue scale there was a pain reduction of 52.3% (p </= 0.001) which was still detectable after one year. We did not find any correlation between the restored height of the vertebra and the reduction of pain. Furthermore, we did not find any correlation concerning pain reduction in the visual analogue scale irrespective of whether the fracture was detected initially with conventional X-rays or later with MRI. In 5 patients (7.3%) there were subsequent vertebral fractures without any trauma. All of these fractures were treated again operatively by a kyphoplasty. CONCLUSION: Especially in geriatric patients with osteoporosis, vertebral fractures can be underdiagnosed with conventional X-rays. Persisting or increasing pain should lead to an MRI to detect and to determine the age of the fracture. In acute fractures, patients profit very well with a significant long-term pain reduction and as a result with an increased mobility after balloon kyphoplasty.",ger,0.0

Ferguson,2016.0,The Effectiveness of Percutaneous Vertebroplasty Is Determined by the Patient-Specific Bone Condition and the Treatment Strategy,10.1371/journal.pone.0151680,"PURPOSE: Vertebral fragility fractures are often treated by injecting bone cement into the collapsed vertebral bodies (vertebroplasty). The mechanisms by which vertebroplasty induces pain relief are not completely understood yet and recent debates cast doubt over the outcome of the procedure. The controversy is intensified by inconsistent results of randomized clinical trials and biomechanical studies that have investigated the effectiveness or the change in biomechanical response due to the reinforcement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vertebroplasty, by varying the relevant treatment parameters and (a) computationally predicting the improvement of the fracture risk depending on the chosen treatment strategy, and (b) identifying the determinants of a successful treatment. METHODS: A Finite Element model with a patient-specific failure criterion and direct simulation of PMMA infiltration in four lumbar vertebrae was used to assess the condition of the bone under compressive load before and after the virtual treatment, simulating in a total of 12000 virtual treatments. RESULTS: The results showed that vertebroplasty is capable of reducing the fracture risk by magnitudes, but can also have a detrimental effect. Effectiveness was strongly influenced by interactions between local bone quality, cement volume and injection location. However, only a moderate number of the investigated treatment strategies were able to achieve the necessary improvement for preventing a fracture. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the effectiveness of vertebroplasty is sensitive to the patient's condition and the treatment strategy.",eng,0.0

The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with a single compression fracture with an intravertebral cleft have better outcome after percutaneous vertebroplasty than do patients with a compression fracture but no cleft. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to review 354 consecutive percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures on 694 compression fractures. Patients were excluded from consideration if they were treated for metastatic compression fracture or if they were treated at more than a single vertebral body level. Sixty-five patients met the inclusion criteria. Preprocedure radiographs and MR images were reviewed with specific attention to the presence or absence of intravertebral gas or fluid. Images obtained at the procedure also were reviewed for the presence or absence of an intravertebral cleft. Imaging findings were correlated with subjective pain scores immediately, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after the procedure. RESULTS: Thirty-one (48%) of the 65 patients had evidence of a fracture cleft. Twenty-seven patients had opacification of an intravertebral fracture cleft at percutaneous vertebroplasty, and four patients had an intravertebral cleft on preprocedure imaging but did not have cleft opacification. Thirty-four (52%) of the patients had no evidence of a fracture cleft and had only a trabecular pattern of opacification. Although there was a trend toward a greater failure rate in patients with a filled cleft, there was no statistically significant difference in subjective pain scores between the groups. CONCLUSION: Pain relief with vertebroplasty is similar in patients with and those without intravertebral fracture clefts. Because of the small number of unfilled fracture clefts in our population, the true incidence of post-percutaneous vertebroplasty pain in patients with an un-filled cleft remains uncertain.",eng,1.0

However there are concerns that this intervention may lead to further fractures in the adjacent vertebral segments. This study was designed to parametrically assess the influence of both treatment factors (cement volume and number of augmentations), and patient factors (bone and disc quality) on the biomechanical effects of vertebroplasty. METHODS: Specimen-specific finite element models of two experimentally-tested human three-vertebral-segments were developed from CT-scan data. Cement augmentation at one and two levels was represented in the respective models and good agreement in the predicted stiffness was found compared to the corresponding experimental specimens. Parametric variations of key variables associated with the procedure were then studied. FINDINGS: The segmental stiffness increased with disc degeneration, with increasing bone quality and to a lesser extent with increasing cement volume. Cement modulus did not have a great influence on the overall segmental stiffness and on the change in the elemental stress in the adjoining vertebrae. However, following augmentation, the stress distribution in the adjacent vertebra changed, indicating possible load redistribution effects of vertebroplasty. INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates the importance of patient factors in the outcomes of vertebroplasty and suggests that these may be one reason for the variation in clinical results.",eng,0.0

Although short-term clinical outcomes appear favourable, long-term data are not yet available and it is becoming increasingly important to understand how the underlying biomechanics of the spine are altered by the procedure. In vitro experimental studies have investigated the effect of cement augmentation on individual vertebra and short spinal segments. For individual vertebra, vertebroplasty appears to increase or return strength to the prefracture level, whereas the stiffness is not always restored. However for multiple-vertebra segments, the strength of the unit as a whole appears to decrease, with failure occurring in the non-augmented vertebrae. Both finite element (FE) and experimental studies have shown that the volume of cement injected affects the restoration of strength and stiffness. The type of cement appears to have less of an effect. Although biomechanical studies of the vertebroplasty process have indicated that the procedure has the potential to restore vertebral strength and stiffness, further work is necessary to understand fully the effects of the augmentation process on the surrounding structures if the treatment is to be fully optimized.

Following a simulated compression fracture, the model was augmented with one of three volumes of PMMA-based cement or left untreated. Upon reloading, an increase in segment stiffness was found with increasing volumes of cement. However, in all the treated models there was an increase in endplate deflection into the adjacent vertebra causing plastic failure of the surrounding trabecular bone. More damage was caused in the adjacent vertebra of the treated models than in the untreated model.

Other types of painful osteolytic bone lesions, such as osteoporotic vertebral fractures and vertebral metastasis are in the meantime more commonly treated using this method. METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: Within the last few years, this technique has become widely accepted and it is proposed for osteolytic bone lesions in areas that are more difficult to approach surgically, e.g., the pelvis and sacrum. EFFICACY: Rapid pain relief and resulting stability have conferred an important role upon osteoplasty especially in palliative tumor-treatment for patients with shortened expected life spans. In addition, combined treatment of painful osteolytic metastases with image-guided thermoablation and percutaneous cement injection has been shown to be a safe palliative modality in the therapy of nonresectable tumors.",ger,0.0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study balloon kyphoplasty was performed in 34 consecutive patients (25 females, 9 males; mean age 75 years) with 56 painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures (from T6-L5), of which 22 showed a posterior wall involvement and retropulsion on preoperative CT. The median duration of symptoms was 9.7 weeks. Symptomatic levels were identified by correlating the clinical presentation with MRI, conventional radiographs and CT including bone-densitometry. Pre- and postoperative examinations (radiographs, CT) as well as Karnofsky and visual analogy pain scores (Visual Analog Scale = VAS) were documented and compared to evaluate the success of the procedure. RESULTS: The median Karnofsky score improved from 40 % (pre-) to 70 % (post-treatment). Simultaneously, median pain scores (VAS) decreased from 64 (pre-) to 21 (post-treatment) (p < 0.001). Perioperative morbidity included one transient L2 nerve root bruise. The procedure led to a partial restoration of the height of the vertebral body by reducing the median sagittal index from 11.5(3) to 5(3). In none of our patients, the procedure led to worsening of the fracture-induced narrowing of the spinal canal. Clinically asymptomatic cement leakage occurred in 10 cases, with leakage 4 times into the paraspinal space, 3 times into the spinal canal and 3 times into the disc space. CONCLUSION: Balloon kyphoplasty is a safe and effective procedure. It is applicable even in fractures with posterior wall involvement since it is a low-pressure technique in contrast to vertebroplasty and restores vertebral body height partially. It results in immediate clinical improvement of mobility and pain relief. While short-term results are excellent, follow-up data have to be awaited for the final judgment of this method.",ger,0.0
Journal Article,H. J. Wilke,2015.0,[Biomechanical aspects of vertebral augmentation],10.1007/s00113-015-0066-z,"BACKGROUND: With increasing age, bone mass decreases and the structure of the cancellous bone in the vertebral body changes. Especially in osteoporotic patients, but also with metastases in the vertebral body, this leads to decreased strength and, thus, to an increased risk of vertebral fractures. It is expected that this problem will increase significantly because of demographic developments. To treat or to prevent such vertebral fractures, different augmentation techniques have been developed. They can mainly be divided into vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty procedures. PURPOSE: The goal of this paper is to summarize biomechanical aspects of these augmentations procedures and to present some alternative methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With vertebroplasty, the loss of bone mass is balanced by injecting bone cement which improves the failure strength of the affected vertebral body. With kyphoplasty, cavities are created and these are filled with bone cement. RESULTS: Disadvantages of vertebroplasty are uncontrollable cement extrusion and increased fracture risk in the adjacent vertebral bodies. With balloon kyphoplasty, the adjacent cancellous bone is compacted during dilation and, thus, does not allow good integration with the remaining trabeculae. In addition, this method is associated with an increased risk of fracture in the adjacent vertebrae. To counter these disadvantages, a number of new types of cement and alternative augmentation methods are being developed, with which the vertebral body may be filled or distracted. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of these new methods should be tested in appropriate experimental biomechanical studies before they are used in patients.",ger,0.0

The Kiva(R) Vertebral Compression Fracture Treatment System, a stacked coil implant made of polyetheretherketone and delivered over a guide-wire, is a novel device designed to provide height restoration and mechanical stabilization, while improving cement containment and minimizing disruption of cancellous bone. The objective of this study was to determine whether the Kiva system is as effective as balloon kyphoplasty at restoring mechanical properties in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. METHODS: Wedge fractures were created in the middle vertebra of fourteen osteoporotic three-vertebra spine segments and then repaired with either the Kiva or kyphoplasty procedure. Height, stiffness and displacement under compression of the spine segments were measured for four conditions: intact, fractured, augmented, and post-cyclic eccentric loading (50,000cycles, 200-500N, 30mm anterior lever arm). FINDINGS: No significant differences were seen between the two procedures for height restoration, stiffness at high or low loads, or displacement under compression. However, the Kiva System required an average of 66% less cement than kyphoplasty to achieve these outcomes (mean 2.6 (SD 0.4) mL v. mean 7.5 (SD 0.8) mL 0; P<0.01). Extravasations and excessive posterior cement flow were also significantly lower with Kiva (0/7 v. 4/7; P<.05). INTERPRETATION: Kiva exhibits similar biomechanical performance to balloon kyphoplasty, but may reduce the risk of extravasation through the containment mechanism of the implant design and by reducing cement volume.",eng,0.0

Potential explanations include placebo response or therapeutic response to the control procedure"". We investigated whether preliminary facet joint injection can identify those patients whose pain arises from paravertebral structures rather than the vertebral insufficiency fracture itself. METHODS: Patients referred for treatment by vertebroplasty were first offered local anaesthetic and steroid facet joint injection (FJI) at the most painful level. Those who failed to respond were offered a vertebroplasty. RESULTS: Ninety one patients referred, 16 went straight to vertebroplasty. Sixty one of 75 were initially offered FJI. Twenty one were successful; two relapsed, had further FJIs with good results; three declined treatment; 5 had temporary benefit; 1 died from unrelated causes. Of 29 who failed to respond to FJIs, 24 underwent vertebroplasty and 23 had a successful outcome. CONCLUSIONS: A third of patients technically suitable for vertebroplasty responded beneficially to FJI. In this group the pain mediator maybe one of instability and overload on the facet joints produced by adjacent wedge fracture.

This permitted a low-pressure injection and potentially reduces the risk of extravasation of cement into the spinal canal. METHODS: Prospective audit for outcome measures and complications allowed retrospective review of cases treated by coblation.

Outcome measures were recorded with a 56 % success rate, 6 % no change and 32 % with mixed but mainly positive results; 6 % died before follow-up. No complications were observed; in particular no patient suffered neurological damage and none have developed subsequent fractures at the treated levels. CONCLUSIONS: This technique makes possible cementation of patients who would otherwise be unsuitable for vertebroplasty. The modest pain and disability improvement is partly due to our stringent criteria as well as fracture complexity. Further work will assess the efficacy of the method compared with conservative measures. KEY POINTS: * Treatment of vertebral compression fractures with possible posterior wall defects is controversial. * Coblation before vertebroplasty allows a low-pressure injection into fractured vertebrae. * This technique reduces risk of extravasation of cement. * No serious complication of our coblation procedures was observed.",eng,1.0

In general, this disease of the elderly patient is characterized by severe local back pain. Pathophysiologically, bony instability triggers local pain during body movement. Serious pain immobilizes the patients and forces them to bed rest. As a result, complications like thrombosis or pneumonia occur. Invasive treatment with surgical instrumentation for vertebral stabilization is not indicated in elderly patients especially with additional diseases. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that percutaneous polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) vertebroplasty significantly reduces pain due to vertebral collapse in osteoporotic patients and improves quality of life.
METHODS: A total of 38 patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine were treated by PMMA vertebroplasty. After admission, before discharge from the hospital, six weeks, half a year and one year later patients answered the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability (OLBPD) Questionnaire for assessment of treatment related change in disability. In all patients percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed under local anesthesia.
FINDINGS: A total of 92% of patients reported a significant pain reduction immediately after treatment. Also one year after vertebroplasty pain remained significantly reduced. Vertebroplasty was highly beneficial for patients with pain related to local instability of the spine. Extravasation of PMMA beyond the vertebral margins was observed in 26% of the cases. No treatment related clinical or neurological complications were noticed.
INTERPRETATION: PMMA vertebroplasty is a useful and safe method of pain relief which rapidly regains quality of life for patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression.

Ford,2015.0,A Biomechanical Assessment of Kyphoplasty as a Stand-Alone Treatment in a Human Cadaveric Burst Fracture Model,10.1097/brs.0000000000000967,"STUDY DESIGN: In vitro biomechanics study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether kyphoplasty is an adequate stand-alone treatment for restoring biomechanical stability in the spine after experiencing high-energy vertebral burst fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Kyphoplasty in the treatment of high-energy vertebral burst fractures has been shown by previous studies to significantly improve stiffness when used in conjunction with pedicle screw instrumentation. However, it is not known whether kyphoplasty as a stand-alone treatment may be an acceptable method for restoring biomechanical stability of a spinal motion segment post-burst fracture while allowing flexibility of the motion segment through the intervertebral discs. METHODS: Young cadaveric spines (15-50 yr old; 3 males and 1 female; bone mineral density 0.27-0.31 gHA/cm) were divided into motion segments consisting of 3 intact vertebrae separated by 2 intervertebral discs (T11-L1 and L2-L4). Mechanical testing in axial, flexion/extension, lateral bending, and torsion was performed on each specimen in an intact state, after an experimentally simulated burst fracture and postkyphoplasty. Computed tomography was used to confirm the burst fractures and quantify cement placement. RESULTS: Between the intact and burst-fractured states significant decreases in stiffness were seen in all loading modes (63%-69%). Burst fracture increased the average angulation of the vertebral endplates 147% and decreased vertebral body height by an average of 40%. Postkyphoplasty, only small recoveries in stiffness were seen in axial, flexion/extension, and lateral bending (4%-12%), with no improvement in torsional stiffness. Large angular deformations (85%) and height loss (31%) remained postkyphoplasty as compared with the intact state. CONCLUSION: Lack of overall improvement in biomechanical stiffness indicates failure of kyphoplasty to sufficiently restore stability as a stand-alone treatment after high-energy burst fracture. The lack of stability can be explained by an inability to biomechanically repair the compromised intervertebral discs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.",eng,0.0

It was reported by some authors in the literature that percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) in these conditions were performed without complications. OBJECTIVE: We describe a patient with radicular pain related to compression of the dorsal root ganglion by malignant tumor which was relieved after PV. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Pain management clinic. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old man with spine metastasis involving the dorsal root ganglion of the left L4 nerve was admitted to the pain clinic with a tingling sensation and pain in both legs for 6 months. He was not able to lie on his back with his left leg extended or stand without weakness. The transforaminal epidural block had only a transient effect. The patient planned to undergo PV. He complained of severe radicular pain in his left leg approximately 5 minutes after the vertebroplasty. A left L4/5 transforaminal epidural block was performed. The next day, the patient's pain was relieved without any complications. He underwent palliative radiation therapy for multiple metastases of the thoracolumbar spine. At 5 months follow-up, he could lie on his back without recurrence of radicular pain. LIMITATIONS: This report describes a single case report. CONCLUSION: We suggest that carefully performed PV is an option for terminally ill patients with epidural and dorsal root ganglion involvement who do not respond to conservative treatment or cannot undergo radiation therapy and surgery. PV is minimally invasive compared to open surgery and may merit serious consideration in patients with limited physiologic reserves.",eng,0.0

PURPOSE: To review the most current information regarding the pathophysiology, injury pattern, treatment options, and outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Relevant articles, textbook chapters, and abstracts covering thoracolumbar spine fractures with and without neurologic deficit from 1960 to the present were reviewed. RESULTS: The thoracolumbar spine represents a unique system from a skeletal as well as neurological standpoint. The rigid rib-bearing thoracic spine articulates with the more mobile lumbar spine at the thoracolumbar junction (T10 - L2), the site of most fractures. A complete examination includes a careful neurologic examination of both motor and sensory systems. CT scans best describe bony detail while MRI is most efficient at describing soft tissues and neurological structures. The most recent classification system is that of the new Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score. The different fracture types include compression fractures, burst fractures - both stable and unstable -, flexion-distraction injuries and fracture dislocations. Their treatment, both operative and non-operative depends on the degree of bony compromise, neurological involvement, and the integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex. Minimally invasive approaches to the care of thoracolumbar injuries have become more popular, thus, the evidence regarding their efficacy is presented. Finally, the treatment of osteoporotic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine is reviewed, including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, their risks and controversies, and senile burst fractures, as well. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracolumbar spine fractures remain a significant source of potential morbidity. Advances in treatment have minimized the invasiveness of our surgery and in certain stable situations, eliminated it all together.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess radiologic features of intravertebral cleft (IVC) in nonacute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) patients, and analyze the existence of IVC impact on outcomes of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The IVC sign is regarded as vertebral instability and the cause of persisting pain. It is more likely to happen at nonacute OVCFs patients. Patients with IVC sign have different outcomes from these without IVC treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty. There were rare reports about the outcomes of patients with IVC sign treated by PKP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We divided 92 nonacute OVCFs patients (total of 113 vertebrae) into 2 groups according to the existence of IVC. Preoperative and postoperative Visual Analogue Scales, Oswestry Disability Index, kyphotic angulation (KA), and anterior vertebral height were recorded; the incidence and radiologic features of IVC were analyzed. RESULTS: The diagnostic sensitivity of IVC on plain radiograph, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were 35.4%, 89.3%, and 83.3%, respectively. The IVC group had an average correction KA of 9.14 degrees and reduction of ratio of compression of 20.09%, and the non-IVC group was 8.76 degrees and 20.23%, respectively. Cleft pattern of cement accounted for 64.6% in IVC group and 27.7% in non-IVC group. Five/7 of cement leakage in IVC group was intradiscal leakage, whereas 7/9 of cement leakage in non-IVC group was perivertebral leakage. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were more sensitivity to diagnose IVC sign than X-ray. PKP could improve pain, functional activity, KA, and anterior height of both IVC and non-IVC groups, however, there was more cleft pattern of cement and higher intradiscal cement leakage in the IVC group.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,A. M. Wu; W. F. Ni; W. Weng; Y. L. Chi; H. Z. Xu; X. Y.

Visual Analogue Score (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Kyphotic Angulation (KA), and Compression Ratio (CR) improved significantly postoperatively (p < 0.05). These values were maintained at the one year follow-up. Balloon kyphoplasty leads less often to leakage (here in only 14.3% of the patients) than vertebroplasty (in 75% according to the literature).

Surgical removal of epidural polymethylmetharylate is usually necessary to achieve good neurologic recovery. Because mobilizing the squeezed spinal cord in a compromised canal can cause further deterioration, attempts to remove epidural polymethylmetharylate in the thoracic region need special consideration. A 66-year-old man had incomplete paraparesis and radicular pain on the chest wall after percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic compression fracture of T7. Radiological studies revealed polymethylmetharylate extravasations into the right lateral aspect of spinal canal that caused marked encroachment of the thecal sac and right neuroforamina. Progressive neurologic deficit and poor responses to medical managements were observed; therefore, surgical decompression was performed 4 months later. After laminectomy and removal of facet joints and T7 pedicle on the affected side, extravasated polymethylmetharylate posterior and anterior to the thecal sac was completely removed without retracting the dura mater. Spinal stability was reconstructed by supplemental spinal instrumentation and intertransverse arthrodesis with banked cancellous allografts.

They are classified by the authors based on observations and measurements from preoperative and postoperative dynamic lateral radiographs. Compression fractures are divided into two types. Type I is a compression fracture involving the anterior column only. Type II is a fracture involving both the anterior and middle column. Each type is divided into two groups: fractures with union and those with non-union. Type II compression fractures have a higher incidence of non-union than type I (p<0.05). In both type I and II non-union groups, fractures achieve greater increase in vertebral body height after vertebroplasty than both type I and type II union group fractures (p<0.05). In both non-union groups, fractures achieved a greater reduction of kyphotic angle post-vertebroplasty than type I and II union group fractures (p<0.05).

OBJECTIVE: The study focuses on the issues concerning the diagnosis of FD and the outcome of conventional surgical techniques (resection or curettage) and vertebroplasty in the treatment of spinal FD lesions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical excision or curettage is considered the standard treatment of spinal FD, whereas vertebroplasty is also performed occasionally. METHODS: Between January 2005 and October 2010, 8 consecutive patients with spinal FD underwent conventional surgery (6 cases) or combined with vertebroplasty (2 cases). Before surgery, 4 patients underwent percutaneous computed tomography-guided biopsy, whereas 3 had incorrect histopathological diagnosis. In each of the 8 cases, the final pathological diagnosis was established after their open surgery. RESULTS: Pain relief was observed postoperatively in all patients. Three patients with neurological impairment became symptom-free after surgery. No cement extravasation was observed. Screw loosening and allograft resorption were observed in 1 case each. Signs of radiological improvement (filling of lytic lesions or thickening of the bone cortex surrounding the lesions) were not detected in any case. CONCLUSION: The radiological features of spinal FD may be atypical. The rate of correct preoperative pathological diagnosis by computed tomography-guided biopsy was low for patients with suspected spinal FD. Vertebroplasty is probably a valuable therapeutic option for spinal FD with pathological fractures. Limited decompression and stability with vertebroplasty might be recommended for patients with neurological deficits.",eng,0.0

We propose hereby an alternative, simple method to treat kyphosis due to the vertebral fracture which has brought about comparable outcomes. METHODS: Three patients with documented adjacent segment compression fractures were treated. Vertebroplasty was performed with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), either using the transpedicular route at the adjacent level or via the route of the previous transpedicular screw at the top level of the long-segment fixation construct. Outcomes were measured by the visual analogue scale of pain and the kyphotic angle of the adjacent segment. RESULTS: The maximal kyphotic angle was 30.6 degrees preoperatively and the reduction rate averaged 69.6%. The pain scale improved from the mean of 9.3 to 1.7. No further progression of compression was noted in the follow-up of more than 6 months after the vertebroplasty in these cases.

However, osteoporotic VCF can possess dynamic mobility with intravertebral cleft (IVC), which can be demonstrated on supine lateral radiographs (SuLR) and standing lateral radiographs (StLR). The purposes of this study were to: (1) evaluate the efficacy of SuLR to detect IVCs and assess the intravertebral mobility in VCFs, and (2) evaluate the short-term results of vertebroplasty in severely collapsed VCFs with IVCs. METHODS: We enrolled 37 patients with 40 symptomatic osteoporotic VCFs for vertebroplasty; 11 had severely collapsed VCFs with concurrent IVCs detected on the SuLR, the others had not-severely collapsed VCFs. A preoperative StLR, SuLR, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and postoperative StLR were taken from all patients. Radiographs were digitized to calculate vertebral body morphometrics including vertebral height ratio and Cobb's kyphotic angle. The intensity of the patient's pain was assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS) on the day before operation and 1 day, 1 month, and 4 months after operation. The patient's VAS scores and image measurement results were assessed with the paired t-test and Pearson correlation tests; Mann-Whitney U test was used for VAS subgroup comparison. Significance was defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: IVCs in patients with not-severely collapsed VCFs were detected in 21 vertebrae (72.4%) by MRI, in 15 vertebrae (51.7%) by preoperative SuLR, and in 7 vertebrae (24.1%) by preoperative StLR. Using the MRI as a gold standard to detect IVCs, SuLR exhibit a sensitivity of 0.71 as compared to StLR that yield a sensitivity of 0.33. In patients with VCFs with IVCs detected on SuLR, the average of the postoperative restoration in vertebral height ratio was significantly higher than that in those without IVCs (17.1% vs. 6.4%). There was no statistical difference in the VAS score between severely collapsed VCFs with IVCs detected on SuLR and not-severely collapsed VCFs at any follow-up time point. CONCLUSIONS: The SuLR efficiently detects an IVC in VCF, which indicates a better vertebral height correction after vertebroplasty compared to VCF without IVC. Before performing a costly MRI, SuLR can identify more IVCs than StLR in patients with severely collapsed VCFs, whom may become the candidates for vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Sixteen bovine thoracolumbar spines (T11-L1) were divided into 4 groups (A,B,C and D). After burst-fracture model was created, 12 vertebral bodies in Groups A, B and C were augmented with calcium sulfate cement (CSC), calcium phosphate cement (CPC) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement, respectively. Each anterior vertebral body height was measured with a caliper at 4 time points: intact conditions (HInt), post-fracture (HFr), post-reduction (HRe) and post-vertebroplasty (HVP). The filling volume of 3 different bone cements was also measured. Each vertebral body was compressed at 0.5 mm/s using a hinged plating system on a materials testing machine to 50% of the post-vertebroplasty height to determine strength and stiffness. Difference was checked using t test or One-way ANOVA. RESULTS: The average strike energy was 66.2 J. Vertebroplasty with different cements could sustain vertebral height. The average filling volume of bone cement in 3 groups was 4.35 ml (CSC), 3.72 ml (CPC) and 3.95 ml (PMMA), respectively, and there was no statistically significant difference among them (P larger than 0.05). Vertebroplasty with PMMA completely restored strength (116%) and stiffness (105%). CSC or CPC partly recovered vertebral strength and stiffness. However, greater strength restoration was got with CSC (1659 N) as compared with CPC (1011N, P less than 0.01). Regarding stiffness, differences between CSC (140 N/mm+/-40 N/mm)and the other two bone cements (CPC:148 N/mm+/-33 N/mm, PMMA:236 N/mm+/-97 N/mm) were not significant (P larger than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For a burst-fracture of calf spine, use of CSC for vertebroplasty yields similar vertebral stiffness as compared with PMMA or CPC. Although augmentation with CSC partly obtains the normal strength, this treatment still can be applied in thoracolumbar burst fractures with other instrumental devices in light of its bioactivation.",eng,1.0

Zeta-potential measurements indicated that the citrate anion was binding to one or more of the positively charged species causing charged repulsion between cement particles which dispersed aggregates and caused the liquefying effect of the anion. Analysis of the hydrating phases of PC indicated that the early strength producing PC phase (ettringite) developed within the first 2 h of setting following addition of the citrate anion, while this did not occur in the control cement (PC only). Within 24 h ettringite developed in PC as well as calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), the major setting phase of PC, whereas cements containing citrate did not develop this phase. The evidence suggested that in the presence of citrate the cements limited water supply appeared to be utilized for ettringite formation, producing the early strength of the citrate cements. The present study has demonstrated that it is possible to modify PC with citrate to both improve the injectability and crucially reduce the setting times of PC while improving the strength of the cement.",eng,0.0

BACKGROUND: PVP and BKP are two minimally invasive procedures for treating OVCFs, while few studies emphases attention to intra- and post-operative complications about the two procedures. METHODS: Online databases were searched for studies comparing complications of PVP and BKP for OVCFs, the randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials and cohort studies that provided related data were identified. Demographic characteristics and complications related to procedures were extracted and analysed from all of the included studies. RESULTS: Nineteen studies encompassing 1,787 patients in total, of whom 887 received PVP and 900 received BKP, met the inclusion criteria. For subsequent fractures, our meta-analysis detected no significant difference between the two procedures, both for adjacent fractures (p = 0.29) and non-adjacent fractures (p = 0.37). For cement extravasations, there was no significant difference between the two interventions if considering disc spaces extravasations only (p = 0.24), while considering total extravasations and paravertebral extravasations, the cement leakage rate in the PVP group was significantly higher than the BKP group (total: p < 0.01; paravertebral: p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The two procedures suffer from equal risk of subsequent spinal fractures; PVP has a significant higher cement leakage rate compared to BKP, mainly caused by a higher paravertebral leakage, patients with extremely poor pulmonary function or unstable haemodynamic are better candidates for BKP.",eng,0.0

METHODS: A total of 50 patients aged 30-55 years old who suffered from thoracolumbar burst fracture complicated with incomplete paralysis or without neurologic symptom received surgery by using pedicle-screw implantation, reduction and bone cement filling through the unilateral or bilateral pedicles. The bone cement injection was conducted slowly and cautiously under monitor of fluoroscopy. Spinal canal exploration or decompression was performed regularly in follow-ups by X-ray films and CT scans. RESULTS: Cement leakage occurred in 5 cases without relevant symptom, including 1 case with leak from anterior aspect, 2 cases from lateral aspect, and 2 cases through ruptured end-plate into disc space. No spinal canal leakage or introvascular leakage was detected. The following-up duration was 5 to 10 years. There was no vertebral body height loss and regional kyphosis. The gaps within fractured vertebral body prior to surgery were disappeared completely. There was also no cement-bone interface detected. In 15 out of 50 cases, there were newly-formed bone bridges between fractured vertebral body and upper or lower adjacent vertebral body. There was no hardware failure occurred up to final follow-up. CONCLUSION: Bone cement filling combined with posterior instrumentation through pedicle-screw technique is a safe, practical and effective method for treatment of non-osteoporotic thoracolumbar spinal burst fractures without severe neurologic injury. The gaps among fracture fragments can be filled evenly and completely. Therefore, instant and permanent spinal stability can be achieved with excellent long-term result.",chi,0.0

Pain scores on one day before the surgery, on one day after the surgery and at the end of the follow-up were recorded using VAS. The VAS scores were analyzed by Wilcoxon rank-sum test using SPSS 19.0. The distribution and leakage of PMMA and complications (cardiopulmonary dysfunction, dysneuria, etc.) were evaluated by CT and plain film. RESULTS: PVP in all patients was successful. The preoperative mean value of VAS and the postoperative mean value of VAS showed statistical difference (8.4 +/- 1.4 and 3.1 +/- 2.3 respectively). At the end of follow-up, the mean value of VAS was 3.4 +/- 1.9. Bone cement leakage was observed in 35 vertebrae. Among the cases with bone cement leakage, one case showed the related complication (radiating pain in left limb) and was relieved after treatment of dexamethasone and analgesia for one week; the others did not present any related complication.

OBJECTIVE: To discuss the factors related to the cement leakage in PVA procedure for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PVA is widely applied for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Cement leakage is a major complication of this procedure. The risk factors for cement leakage were controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 192 patients who underwent PVA was conducted. The following data were recorded: age, sex, bone density, number of fractured vertebrae before surgery, number of treated vertebrae, severity of the treated vertebrae, operative approach, volume of injected bone cement, preoperative vertebral compression ratio, preoperative local kyphosis angle, intraosseous clefts, preoperative vertebral cortical bone defect, and ratio and type of cement leakage. To study the correlation between each factor and cement leakage ratio, bivariate regression analysis was employed to perform univariate analysis, whereas multivariate linear regression analysis was employed to perform multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The study included 192 patients (282 treated vertebrae), and cement leakage occurred in 100 vertebrae (35.46%). The vertebrae with preoperative cortical bone defects generally exhibited higher cement leakage ratio, and the leakage is typically type C. Vertebrae with intact cortical bones before the procedure tend to experience type S leakage. Univariate analysis showed that patient age, bone density, number of fractured vertebrae before surgery, and vertebral cortical bone were associated with cement leakage ratio (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the main factors influencing bone cement leakage are bone density and vertebral cortical bone defect, with standardized partial regression coefficients of -0.085 and 0.144, respectively. CONCLUSION: High bone density and vertebral cortical bone defect are independent risk factors associated with bone cement leakage.",eng,1.0

Xu,2015.0,The Incidence of New Vertebral Fractures Following Vertebral Augmentation: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,10.1097/md.0000000000001532,"A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed that compares the relationship between percutaneous vertebral augmentation (PVA) and conservative treatments with the incidence of new vertebral fractures. Using meta-analytic techniques, this study compares PVA and conservative treatment for incidence of new vertebral fractures, particularly incidence of adjacent fractures that occur following treatment.A focus of clinicians has been on whether PVA increases the risk of new vertebral fractures. Pubmed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to retrieve literature published from the establishment of the databases until April 28, 2015. Literature of related areas was searched manually. The main outcome indicator was the incidence of new vertebral fractures at final follow-up appointment. In addition, we evaluated the incidence of new vertebral fractures in different follow-up periods and the incidence of adjacent fractures. The RevMan 5.3 software program of the Cochrane Collaboration was used to analyze the data. For dichotomous variables, the risk ratio (RR) and a confidence interval (CI) of 95% were used to express the heterogeneity of the effect size. Seven randomized controlled trial studies were selected from the literature. The studies include 871 patients, 436 of whom received PVA treatment and the rest received conservative treatment. Combined analysis of the 7 studies showed that the numbers of new vertebral fractures in the 2 groups are not significantly different. Six studies reported the numbers of new adjacent fractures. Considering the heterogeneity among the studies, 2 subgroups were formed. The 5 studies in the European group showed that the incidence of new adjacent fractures in the PVA-treated group is higher than that in the conservatively treated group, and the difference is statistically significant. The one study in the Asian group showed no significant difference between the incidences of adjacent fractures in the 2 groups. PVA treatment does not increase the incidence of new vertebral fractures. Most studies reported that PVA increases the incidence of adjacent fractures, yet it is rarely stated that both PVA and conservative treatment lead to the same incidence of adjacent fractures.",eng,0.0

Ji,2012.0,Long-term results and radiographic findings of percutanous vertebroplasties with polymethylmethacrylate for vertebral osteoporotic fractures,", ","BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) has become a popular procedure for painful vertebral osteoporotic fracture (VOF), with immediate pain relief and improved mobility; however, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) injected into the vertebral body is not absorbable and little information is available concerning the long-term results. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the long-term clinical results and radiological changes after PVPs for VOFs. METHODS: Fifty-one patients with VOFs were treated by PVPs with PMMA between 2000 and 2004. After > 7 years of follow-up, eight patients had died from causes unrelated to the intervention and 12 patients were lost to follow-up, thus leaving 31 patients available for evaluation with an average length of follow-up of 9.2 years (follow-up rate, 72.1%). Among these 31 patients, the PMMA was injected at 43 levels with a mean volume of 4.3 ml per level (range, 2 - 6 ml). The pain was assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS), and the mobility was graded as walking without difficulty (grade 1), walking with assistance (grade 2), and bedridden (grade 3). Plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT) were obtained and assessed pre-operatively, immediately post-operatively, and after 7 years of follow-up. The PMMA, vertebral height, and Cobb angle were assessed and compared. RESULTS: All of the patients experienced pain relief and improved mobility after intervention and during the follow-up period. Cement leakage was detected in post-operative CT scans in 9 of 51 patients, but without neurological compromise. For the 31 patients followed up over 7 years, the VAS decreased from 8.3 +/- 2.6 pre-operatively, to 2.1 +/- 1.6 immediately post-operatively, and 1.0 +/- 0.9 at the final follow-up evaluation, with significantly improved mobility. Additional compression fractures occurred at adjacent levels in three patients, and there were no new fractures at the augmented vertebrae. Based on a review of the radiographs, neither loose nor displaced cement was detected. The changes in vertebral height and Cobb angle were not significant. On CT scans, the cement closely contacted or infiltrated the trabecular bone. The boundary between the cement and trabecular bone was indistinct and there was no evident radiolucent gap between the cement and trabecular bone. CONCLUSIONS: At an average follow-up of 9.2 years, PVPs provided sustained pain relief and improved mobility in patients with VOFs. The PMMA injected into the vertebral body combined closely with the host trabecular bone without adverse reactions.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,C. Xu; H. X. Liu; H. Z. Xu,2014.0,Analysis of related factors on the deformity correction of balloon kyphoplasty,10.3174/ajnr.A3617,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Balloon kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive surgical approach for treating vertebral compression fractures, including osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of balloon inflation and postural reduction on balloon kyphoplasty for the deformity correction of vertebral compression fractures and to explore the correlative factors affecting the deformity correction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 72 patients (75 levels) who had undergone balloon kyphoplasty was conducted. Imaging data and clinical features were collected and analyzed. Independent-samples t test analysis was used to find the possible factors affecting deformity correction. RESULTS: Postural correction in the overextending position significantly increased anterior middle vertebral height, kyphotic angle, and Cobb angle (each P < .05). There was no significant difference in anterior, middle vertebral height, kyphotic angle, and Cobb angle between postural reduction and balloon dilation (each P > .05). The improvement on the Visual Analog Scale was notable (P < .05). Among a variety of factors, the fracture type (wedge type and biconcave type) affected both the height restoration (P = .003) and kyphotic angle reduction (P = .007). The bone cement injected volume was related to height restoration (P = .011) and kyphotic angle reduction (P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: Balloon inflation was useless for deformity correction. The deformity correction was attributed to postural reduction with cement strengthening. The most significant factors affecting deformity correction were the fracture type and bone cement injected volume.",eng,0.0

METHODS: By simulating internal fixation plus augmentation with cement, eight tridimensional, anatomically detailed finite element models of the T11-L1 functional spinal junction were developed. Two kinds of models for mimicking different severity of the fracture were established according to the Denis' classification. Augmentation with cement was conducted after reduction with posterior fixation using a universal spine system. These models assumed a three-column loading configuration as follows: compression, anteflexion, extension, lateroflexion and axial rotation. Stress of the implants and spine was evaluated. RESULTS: Data showed that for severely fractured models, augmentation apparently decreased the von Mises stresses by 50% for the rods and 40% for the screws, about 40% for the inferior endplate of T11, and 50% for the superior endplate of L1 in vertical compression and other load situations. CONCLUSION: We should only apply vertebroplasty to prevent correction loss and implants failure based on the fact that it could significantly decrease stress of the instrumentations and spine when the vertebrae are severely fractured.

We monitored and recorded the visual analgesic scale (VAS) at pre-operation and 2 days post-operation, operation time, exposure duration, bone cement injection amount and extraosseous cement leakages. RESULTS: PVP procedures were successful in both groups without serious complications. The VAS scores in both two groups at 2 days post-operation were significantly lower than VAS scores at pre-operation (p<0.05). The operation time and exposure duration in the observational group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p<0.05). However, bone cement injection amount and extraosseous cement leakages in the observing group were similar to those in control (p>0.05).

METHODS: Between March 2006 and May 2012, a retrospective analysis was made on the clinical data of 48 cases of severe osteoporotic thoracolumbar compressive fractures with more than 50% collapse of the anterior vertebral body or more than 400 of sagittal angulation, which were treated by LSF-VP in 27 cases (LSF-VP group) or percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) in 21 cases (PKP group). All patients suffered from single thoracolumbar vertebral compressive fracture at T11 to L2. There was no significant difference in gender, age, spinal segment, and T values of bone mineral density between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The effectiveness of the treatment was appraised by visual analogue scale (VAS), Cobb angle of thoracolumbar kyphosis, height of anterior/posterior vertebral body, and compressive ratio of vertebrae before and after operations. RESULTS: The LSF-VP group had longer operation time, hospitalization days, and more bone cement injection volume than the PKP group, showing significant differences (P < 0.05). Intraoperative blood loss in LSF-VP group ranged from 220 to 1,050 mL (mean, 517 mL). No pulmonaryor cerebral embolism or cerebrospinal fluid leakage was found in both groups. Asymptomatic bone cement leakage was found in 3 cases of LSF-VP group and 2 cases of PKP group. The patients were followed up for 16-78 months (mean, 41.1 months) in LSF-VP group, and 12-71 months (mean, 42.1 months) in PKP group. No fixation failure such as loosened or broken pedicle screw was found in LSF-VP group during the follow-up, and no re-fracture or adjacent vertebral body fracture was found. Two cases in PKP group at 39 and 56 months after operation respectively were found to have poor maintenance of vertebral height and loss of rectification (Cobb angle was more than 40 degrees) with recurrence of pain, which were treated by second surgery of LSF-VP; another case had compressive fracture of the adjacent segment and thoracolumbar kyphosis at 16 months after operation, which was treated by second surgery of LSF-VP. There were significant differences in the other indexes between each pair of the three time points (P < 0.05), except the Cobb angle of thoracolumbar kyphosis, and the height of posterior vertebral body between discharge and last follow-up in LSF-VP group, and except the Cobb angle of thoracolumbar kyphosis and compressive ratio of bertebrae between discharge and last follow-up in PKP group (P > 0.05). After operation, the other indexes of LSF-VP group were significantly better than those of PKP group at each time point (P < 0.05), except the VAS score and the height of posterior vertebral body at discharge (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of LSF-VP is satisfactory in treating severe osteoporotic thoracolumbar compressive fractures with kyphosis deformity. LSF-VP can acquire better rectification of kyphosis and recovery of vertebral body height than PKP.",chi,0.0

We prospectively evaluated this treatment in 45 consecutive patients with 63 VCFs treated at our hospital between September and December 2009. In all patients, long-term conservative treatment had failed to achieve pain relief, resulting in reduced changes in activities of daily living (ADL). We evaluated visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for pain before and after vertebral body perforation as well as in the chronic phase, changes in ADL, whether recipients would recommend this treatment, and complications. The mean VAS score improved from 6.9 +/- 1.9 before surgery to 3.6 +/- 2.9 immediately after surgery, and to 2.5 +/- 2.1 at 3 months. ADL was improved in 27 patients, and walking became possible in 16 of 24 patients who had been unable to walk. Nearly two-thirds of patients would strongly recommend this treatment to others. The analgesic effect of vertebral body perforation was significantly lower in patients with than in those without vertebral pseudarthrosis before surgery. Only 1 patient suffered a new fracture during the 3-month period after surgery, but there were no perioperative complications. Vertebral body perforation for painful VCFs can achieve early improvement of ADL due to the analgesic effect in carefully selected patients and is a safe treatment with a low frequency of complications.",eng,0.0

METHODS: A total of 244 patients with VCFs were treated by PVP or PKP and 192 had follow-up for at least 1 year. Clinical outcomes were determined by pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). Preoperative and postoperative radiographic assessment included measurement of posterior and anterior vertebral body height (AH and PH), as well as the kyphotic angle by the Cobb method. RESULTS: A total of 192 cases had follow-up for at least 1 year and 52 cases lost. The average amount of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement introduced per vertebra was 3.4 +/- 1.5 ml in PVP and 4.5 +/- 0.8 ml in PKP (P < 0.05). All patients subjectively reported immediate relief of their typical fracture pain, and the mean VAS decreased significantly from presurgery to postsurgery during the 1-year of follow-up.

Journal Article,L. Yan; Z. Chang; Z. Xu; T. Liu; B. He; D. Hao,2014.0,Biomechanical effects of bone cement volume on the endplates of augmented vertebral body: a three-dimensional finite element analysis,", ","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that percutaneous vertebroplasty might alter vertebral stress transfer, leading to adjacent vertebral failure. However, no three-dimensional finite element study so far accounted for the stress distributions on different cement volumes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stress distributions on the endplate under different loading conditions after augmentation with various volumes of bone cement. METHODS: L2-L3 motion segment data were obtained from CT scans of the lumbar spine from a cadaver of a young man who had no abnormal findings on roentgenograms. Three-dimensional model of L2-L3 was established using Mimics software, and finite element model of L2-L3 functional spinal unit (FSU) was established using Ansys10.0 software. For simulating percutaneous vertebral augmentation, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was deposited into the bipedicle of the L2 vertebra. The percentage of PMMA volume varied between 15% and 30%. The stress distributions on the endplate of the augmented vertebral body were calculated under three different loading conditions. RESULTS: In general, the stress level monotonically increased with bone cement volume. Under each loading condition, the stress change on the L2 superior and inferior endplates in three kinds of finite element models shows monotonic increase. Compared with the stress-increasing region of the endplate, the central part of the L2 endplate was subject to the greatest stress under three kinds of loading conditions, especially on the superior endplate and under flexion. CONCLUSIONS: The finite element models of FSU are useful to optimize the planning for vertebroplasty. The bone cement volume might have an influence on the endplate of the augmentation, especially the superior endplate. It should be noted that the optimization of bone cement volume is patient specific; the volume of the bone cement should be based on the size, body mineral density, and stiffness of the vertebrae of individual patients.",eng,1.0

In contrast, numerous complications and problems have also been reported, such as puncture difficulty, cement leakage, and adjacent vertebral fracture. INTRODUCTION: This study is to evaluate the application and clinical outcomes of unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral PKP in the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF). METHODS: A total of 56 cases with two levels thoracolumbar OVCF were randomly assigned for treatment with unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral PKP. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed mainly with regard to clinical and radiologic outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated with mainly the use of a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain. Radiologic outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of radiation dose and bone cement distribution. RESULTS: The operation was completed successfully in 56 cases. In the unilateral level, the operation time, the volume of the injected cement, and radiation dose were significantly less than bilateral level. All patients had significantly improvement on VAS score after the procedures, compared with their preoperative period. In the bilateral level, 7 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and radiological outcomes for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures using unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PKP is a widely used vertebral augmentation procedure for treating painful vertebral compression fractures. A percutaneous bilateral approach is typically used to access the vertebral body. Many previous studies have reported excellent clinical results with PKP. In contrast, numerous complications and problems have also been reported, such as puncture difficulty, cement leakage, and adjacent vertebral fracture. METHODS: This prospective study included 316 patients with single-level lumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, 224 females and 92 males with a mean age of 71.5 years. Randomized patients underwent PKP using 2 different puncture techniques. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed mainly with regard to clinical and radiological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly using the visual analogue scale for pain and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire for health status. Radiological outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of radiation dose, bone cement distribution, vertebral body height, and kyphotic angle. RESULTS: Patients were followed up from 12 to 28 months, with an average of 16.8 months. One hundred fifty-eight patients were treated with unilateral method and 151 patients were treated with bilateral method. In the unilateral group, the volume of the injected cement and radiation dose were significantly less than that in the bilateral group. All patients in both groups had significantly less pain after the procedures, compared with their preoperative period pain. No statistically significant differences were observed when visual analogue scale and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey were compared between the groups. Both unilateral and bilateral groups showed insignificant decrease in the kyphotic angle during the follow-ups. The kyphotic angle in the unilateral group improved more significantly than in the bilateral group. In the bilateral group, 16 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up.

A prospective cohort study,10.1007/s00198-014-2972-2,"UNLABELLED: Some patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures still suffer from back pain after percutaneous vertebroplasty. We have found that osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with thoracolumbar fascia injury are common and that thoracolumbar fascia injury may account for the residual pain after percutaneous vertebroplasty. PURPOSE: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are successfully treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). However, some patients still suffer from back pain after the procedure. We hypothesized that there is a relationship between thoracolumbar (TL) fascia injury and residual postoperative pain. METHODS: This prospective study included 133 elderly patients (age range 55 - 92 years) with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures treated with PVP from February 2010 to March 2012 in our hospital. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of TL fascia injury. A visual analog scale (VAS) and the Chinese modified Oswestry Disability Index were used to evaluate the pain before and after PVP. RESULTS: The mean VAS score and the Chinese modified Oswestry Disability Index in the patients with TL fascia injury were reduced from 9.11 +/- 0.76 to 6.4 +/- 1.1 and 73.93 +/- 1.46% to 44.6 +/- 3.1%, respectively, and in the patients without TL fascia injury from 9.26 +/- 0.82 to 8.0 +/- 1.3 and 73.96 +/- 1.38% to 51.7 +/- 1.8%, respectively. Pain and disability were reduced more in patients without TL fascia injury than in those with TL fascia injury (both p < 0.05).

METHODS: A total of 222 patients underwent operations from January 2008 to October 2012. One-level fractures numbered 169 (86.7%) cases and two-level fractures numbered 26 (13.3%). A total of 221 vertebral levels were analyzed consequently. Vertebral height, compression ratio, and segmental Cobb's angle were measured in preoperative and postoperative lateral X-rays. RESULTS: The compression ratio was the most influential parameter among three variables. Adjusted postoperative compression ratio was not significantly different between two operation groups. Bone cement leakage rates did not differ (p < 0.05). Bone cement distribution was spongy type in the majority of the vertebroplasty with bone filler device (94.5%), but only in 42.0% of the kyphoplasty. High bone densitometry readings and long period from diagnosis to operation were significant risk factors for bone cement leakage. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty with a bone filler device could achieve equivalent compression reduction and bone cement leakage rate, as well as greater sponge-type bone cement distribution, which were advantages over balloon kyphoplasty.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we determine whether percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) offers extra benefits to aged patients with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) over conservative therapy (CV). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: OVCFs are common in the aged population with osteoporosis. While the optimal treatment of aged patients with acute OVCFs remains controversial, PVP, a minimally invasive procedure, is a treatment option to be considered. METHODS: Patients aged at 70 years or above with acute OVCF and severe pain from minor or mild trauma were assigned randomly to PVP and CV groups. The primary outcome was pain relief as measured by VAS score in 1-year follow-up period. The second outcome was quality of life assessed with ODI and Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO). Patient satisfaction surveys were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 135 patients were enrolled, and 107 (56 in PVP group; 51 in CV group) completed 1-year follow-up. In PVP group, the vertebroplasty procedure was performed at a mean of 8.4 +/- 4.6 days (range, 2-21 days) after onset. Vertebroplasty resulted in much greater pain relief than did conservative treatment at postoperative day 1 (P < 0.0001). At every time point of follow-up, pain relief and quality of life were significantly improved in PVP group than in CV group at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year (all P < 0.0001). The final follow-up surveys indicated that patients in PVP group were significantly more satisfied with given treatment (P < 0.0001). In addition, lower rate of complications was observed in PVP group (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In aged patients with acute OVCF and severe pain, early vertebroplasty yielded faster, better pain relief and improved functional outcomes, which were maintained for 1 year. Furthermore, it showed fewer complications than conservative treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2.",eng,1.0

This study used modified techniques to avoid cement extravasation and dislodgment and investigated the feasibility and efficacy of kyphoplasty for treatment of Kummell's disease. Between May 2006 and May 2008, 21 consecutive patients with Kummell's disease underwent kyphoplasty with modified techniques. Each patient was assessed preoperatively with standard examinations and imaged with dynamic radiographs, 3-dimensional computed tomography scans, and magnetic resonance imaging. A visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index were used to measure pain and disability pre- and postoperatively and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. One patient had cement leakage into the disk space but no clinical symptoms. There were no cases of cement dislodgment at follow-up. Comparison of the pre- vs postoperative VAS scores revealed significant differences (P<.05), whereas VAS scores at 6- vs 12-month follow-up were similar. The Oswestry Disability Index scores varied from 62.3%+/-15.1% preoperatively to 35.2%+/-12.1% postoperatively (P<.05). This improvement in scores was still present at 6- and 12-month follow-up. At 6- and 12-month follow-up, maintenance of height restoration and kyphotic deformity correction was found. Kyphoplasty may be a relatively safe and effective method for treatment of Kummell's disease when modified techniques are used to prevent cement leakage and dislodgment.",eng,0.0

Studies on the comparison of the 2 approaches are relative limited and a wide variation exists in the patient population, study design, and results. These factors make it difficult for workers in this field to know the exact value of the 2 approaches. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the clinical outcomes and complications of kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty for painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF). STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases were searched for all the relevant original articles published from January 1987 to September 2012 comparing kyphoplasty with vertebroplasty for painful OVCF. The following outcomes were mainly evaluated: visual analog scale (VAS), vertebral height, kyphosis angle, new vertebral fractures, and cement leakage. RESULTS: A total of 15 articles fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. The baseline characteristics such as sex, age, and number of prevalent fractures were comparable for both groups (P > .05). VAS score for the kyphoplasty group was significantly more than that for the vertebroplasty group at 1-3 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery (P < .05). Vertebral height in the kyphoplasty group was significantly higher than the vertebroplasty group at 3 months, 6 months, and 2 years (P < 0.05).

This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of nonunion of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Twenty-one patients with nonunion of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were treated with balloon kyphoplasty. The criteria for diagnosis of nonunion osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures included the following: (1) history of pain for at least 6 months at the fracture site; (2) low T1- and high T2-signal on magnetic resonance images; (3) widening of fracture line on routine radiographs; and (4) movement of the endplate and changes of anterior vertebral heights on hyperextension radiographs. All patients were followed for 9 to 33 months postoperatively (mean 25 months). Statistically significant improvements in the mean postoperative anterior and middle vertebral body heights were observed compared with preoperative values. There was also statistically significant improvement in the mean values for Cobb's angle, pain (visual analog scale), and the Oswestry Disability Index at the postoperative assessment compared with the preoperative assessment.

The level of evidence was classified as good, fair, and limited (or poor) based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of 159 cases were enrolled. The methodological quality of the articles was determined as moderate. We did not find any significant difference between unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasty on pain relief, in either short-term or long-term follow-up (P = 0.65 and P = 0.69, respectively). The rate of adjacent vertebral fracture was not statistically different with a P value of 0.88 and 95% CI (confidence intervals) of 0.25-3.26. Cement leakage was comparable between unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasty (P = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46-4.26). The loss of vertebral height in long-term follow-up was not different (P = 0.10, 95% CI = -0.39-4.54). Operation time and cement dosage were considerably less for unilateral kyphoplasty (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). LIMITATIONS: Only 4 RCTs and 159 patients were included in this systematic review. Publication bias also existed among the studies included. CONCLUSIONS: Both unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasty are effective in alleviating the back pain caused by OVCF. Two approaches have the same degree of safety. More RCTs are needed to examine the efficacy and adverse reactions of the 2 approaches.""",eng,0.0

This finite element study was to examine whether short segment pedicle screw fixation (PSF) with kyphoplasty may decrease the fracture risk of the treated and adjacent non-treated vertebrae after kyphoplasty for OVCFs. By simulating cement augmentation with or without short segment pedicle screw fixation (PSF), two tridimensional, anatomically detailed finite element models of the T10-L2 functional spinal junction were developed. The insertion of pedicle screws into the intact vertebra apparently decreased the stress distribution of the treated vertebra in vertical compression and other load situations. The stress distribution in the bone structures of the intact vertebra adjacent to the intact-screwed vertebra was much less than that in the one adjacent to the treated vertebra. The insertion of pedicle screws into the intact vertebra greatly decreased the maximum displacement of the cortical bones and cancellous bones of the vertebrae. Our results indicated that short segment PSF with kyphoplasty may decrease the fracture risk of the treated and adjacent non-treated vertebrae in the management of OVCFs.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Based on the principles and methods of the Cochrane systematic reviews, the records of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese Bio-medicine database, China Journal Full-text Database, VIP database, and Wanfang database were reviewed until October 2014. The randomized controlled trials on unilateral and bilateral approaches to percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP)/percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were included. The risk of bias of included trials was assessed based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version. The RevMan Software 5.0 was used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen randomized controlled trials with a total of 850 patients were included. Risk of bias in the included studies was inevitable. There was no statistically significant difference in visual analog scale, vertebral height, kyphotic angular, and quality of life. The main operative complications were bone cement leakage and adjacent vertebral fracture, without difference between the two groups.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) for treating patients with symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) adjacent to lumbar instrumented circumferential fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few studies have investigated adjacent VCFs and their management after spinal fusion surgery for degenerative lumbar disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2005 to July 2011, a total of 23 patients with lumbar instrumented circumferential fusion suffered from adjacent symptomatic osteoporotic VCFs. All of these patients received PV using polymethylmethacrylate bone cement augmentation in our institute. Radiography and magnetic resonance imaging were used for imaging studies. The visual analog scale and modified Brodsky criteria were used to compare clinical outcomes before and after surgery. The minimum follow-up period was 18 months (range, 18-45 mo). RESULTS: One level PV was performed in 18 patients and 2 levels were performed in 5 patients. The patients' visual analog scale scores improved by an average of 54.3 points after the procedure. Twenty patients returned to their preinjury activities of daily living. Lumbar lordosis was increased from 28.9 degrees before PV to 36.2 degrees after PV. The average restoration of the fractured vertebral body height was 14.0%. No surgery-related complications occurred except asymptomatic cement leakage in 4 patients.

Chung,2008.0,Revision strategies for complications and failure of vertebroplasties,10.1007/s00586-008-0680-3,"Percutaneous vertebroplasty is widely discussed in the management of osteoporotic spinal compression fracture, but few reports are available concerning salvage procedures after failure of this technique. We studied 22 percutaneous vertebroplasty patients who required revision surgery upon presentation of new symptoms postoperatively. The indications for revision surgery included recurrent intractable back pain with no response to medical treatment, infectious spondylitis, cement leakage with neurologic deficit, and cement dislodgement and/or fragmentation. Five patients underwent repeated percutaneous vertebroplasty of the initially cemented vertebrae. Seventeen patients underwent anterior, posterior, or combined anterior and posterior surgery. Four patients required a third surgical procedure because of poor augmentation with cement, subsidence of the anterior bone graft, or pullout of the instrumentation. Finally, four (18%) patients underwent repeat vertebroplasty, two (9%) patients underwent anterior surgery only, one (5%) patient underwent posterior surgery only, and 15 (68%) patients underwent combined anterior and posterior surgery; all but one regained ambulatory status equivalent to that prior to surgery. In conclusion, percutaneous vertebroplasty is a simple and effective, but not risk- or complication-free procedure for the treatment of osteoporotic spinal compression fracture. The spine surgeon should be familiar with varied approaches and techniques for revision surgery. Combined anterior and posterior surgery seems to be the most secure salvage method to treat severely osteoporotic patients in whom percutaneous vertebroplasty initially failed.",eng,1.0

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with NCOVP refractory to medical treatment and severely affecting normal daily activities could be offered therapeutic benefit with percutaneous vertebroplasty. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the records of consecutive percutaneous vertebroplasty procedures performed at our institutions during a 28-month period to define a population of patients who suffered from severe NCOVP. Nine such patients were identified based on physical examination, computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and bone scans. Initial clinical outcomes were assessed by comparing quantitative measurements of pain (10-point scale) and mobility (5-point scale) 1 day before the operation with those 1 day post-operation. A second follow-up took place between 2 weeks and 1 month after the operation, with a third follow-up between 6 and 10 months post-operative. Biopsy was taken in each case. RESULTS: Each patient demonstrated point tenderness over radiographically normal-shaped vertebra. Every patient showed a low signal on T1W images, and seven cases showed a high signal on T2W images inside the vertebra, indicating bone marrow edema. All patients experienced a reduction in pain and an increase in mobility after percutaneous vertebroplasty, with a mean pain reduction of 7.0 points and an average improved mobility of 2.8 points. Biopsy results indicated necrotic and/or degenerative changes in eight cases. CONCLUSION: The clinical outcomes of our patients suggest that NCOVP, mainly verified by abnormal MR signals and biopsy results, can be successfully treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty.",eng,1.0

METHODS: The clinical outcome and incidence of cement extrusion in a consecutive group of 70 patients at our institution between December 2005 and December 2008 was retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-five patients were randomly distributed to modified percutaneous vertebroplasty (Group A) and 35 to traditional percutaneous vertebroplasty (Group B). A visual analog scale (VAS) was used on the first post-operative day and 1 year later to assess the severity of pain before and after vertebroplasty. The incidence of cement extrusion on CT scan was also compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The treatment was successful in all seventy patients. The incidence of cement extrusion was 14.29% (5/35 patients) in group A, and 37.12% (13/35 patients) in group B, this difference being statistically significant (P < 0.05). No patients had serious complications. Complete pain relief was achieved in 50 patients, and significant relief in the other 20 (20/70 patients).

We sought to investigate the incidence of distant pain after osteoporotic vertebral compressive fracture (OVCF) at the thoracolumbar junction, and to explore the effect of kyphoplasty in the treatment of distant pain post-OVCF. Eighty-seven patients diagnosed OVCF between T11 and L2 were included in the study. The region of pain and its proximity to the thoracolumbar compressive fracture was recorded. For pain management, all patients received kyphoplasty. The follow-up period was every 3 months for 1-year post-surgery. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used pre-operatively, post-operatively, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups to assess patient status. All patients completed the operation, with 72 patients having focal pain over the compression fracture. Eleven cases also had pain distal to the fracture region in the following areas: lower back, near the iliac crest (n = 6), the groin (n = 3), and the trochanteric region (n = 2). Four cases had pain in distant to the fracture: lower back, near iliac crest (n = 3), and the trochanteric region (n = 1). All patients had a significant improvement in clinical symptoms. The average VAS and the ODI decreased significantly pre-operatively to post-operatively (p < 0.05). In addition to focal tenderness, many patients with thoracolumbar compression fractures may have pain distant to the fracture. This can be successfully treated using kyphoplasty. This phenomenon also indicates that patients at risk of osteoporosis who also have lower back pain should not neglect the potential for a thoracolumbar fracture.",eng,0.0

To avoid the trauma and complications of open surgery, a minimally invasive procedure, percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), has recently been developed to treat metastatic spinal tumors.
PURPOSE: To analyze the treatment outcomes of metastatic spinal tumors by percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) alone or PVP combined with interstitial implantation of 125I seeds.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 80 patients with metastatic spinal tumors were randomized to receive PVP alone (40 cases) or PVP combined with 125I seed implantation (40 cases). Digital subtraction angiography (DSA)-guided vertebroplasty was performed under local anesthesia, and acrylic bone cement was injected into the vertebra through a bone trocar to the center of the lesion, with or without simultaneous interstitial implantation of 125I seeds.
RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up, PVP combined with 125I seed implantation resulted in zero cases with complete relief (CR), 36 with partial relief (PR), four with no changes (NC), and zero with progression of disease (PD), while PVP alone without seed implantation resulted in 0 CR, 31 PR, 7 NC, and 2 PD. While the combined-treatment group and the single-PVP group showed overall clinical benefit rates without significant difference (100% and 95.0%, respectively), their visual analogue pain scales (VAS; 2.26+/-1.05 and 5.41+/-0.94, respectively) and Karnofsky performance scores (KPS; 92.5+/-7.1 and 87.7+/-7.3, respectively) were significantly different after treatment (P = 0.028 and P = 0.009, respectively). Patients in both groups had 1-year follow-up, and the mean time to tumor progression (TTP) was 9.0 and 8.9 months, respectively (not significant).
CONCLUSION: PVP is a minimally invasive procedure with small wounds and minor complications. It is effective in the alleviation of pain in metastatic spinal tumor patients, and its clinical outcomes can be enhanced by the combination of interstitial implantation of 125I seeds.",English,1.0

METHODS: Eighteen patients with Kummell's disease were treated by unipedicular PVP with graded infusion of bone cement between January 2012 and January 2014. Of 18 cases, 6 were male and 12 were female, aged from 65 to 88 years (mean, 75 years), with a disease duration from 3 to 32 months (mean, 11.6 months). The bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; the T value ranged from -4.0 to -2.8 (mean, -3.4). Affected segments included T11 in 3 cases, T12 in 10 cases, L1 in 3 cases, and L2 in 2 cases. X-ray films were taken after operation to observe bone cement leakage and anterior height changes of affected vertebrae. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were used to assess pain status and functional activity. RESULTS: All cases underwent smoothly unipedicular PVP and were followed up 12-26 months (mean, 14 months). Cement leakage occurred in 4 patients, including 1 case of anterior paravertebral soft tissue leakage, 2 cases of intervertebral disc leakage, and 1 case of canal venous leakage, but there was no other complications. The anterior height of affected vertebrae were significantly improved (P < 0.05) from 29.1% +/- 6.7% at preoperation to 68.1% +/- 7.3% at 3 days after operation and 67.8% +/- 5.9% at last follow-up; the VAS scores were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) from 8.11 +/- 1.32 at preoperation to 2.14 +/- 0.78 at 3 days and 1.97 +/- 0.50 at last follow-up; and ODI were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) from 84.6% +/- 8.5% to 24.1% +/- 9.7% and 23.8% +/- 10.2%; but no significant difference was found between at 3 days and at last follow-up (P > 0.05).

We describe a severe complication associated with this procedure; only one previous case has been reported in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of anterior spinal cord syndrome caused by a direct cement leakage in the arterial vessels after vertebroplasty. METHODS: A 20-year-old man who has been diagnosed with multifocal Ewing sarcoma for 5 months suffered from severe and chronic inflammatory polyarthralgia in the left knee, pelvis, and the low back. The imaging studies, X-ray and computed tomography scan, showed the presence of pathologic fractures of T8 and L1 vertebrae. There was no retropulsion of bony fragment in the vertebral canal. A percutaneous vertebroplasty of T8 and L1 level was performed. RESULTS: Immediately after the procedure, the patient experienced a total paralysis and loss of sensitivity to pain and temperature in both lower limbs; however, deep pressure sensation and two-point discrimination below the umbilicus were preserved. Computed tomography scans showed no leakage of polymethylmethacrylate of T8 and L1 vertebral bodies, with opacification of the right intercostal artery at the L1 level and a segment of the anterior spinal artery at the T10-L1 level. CONCLUSIONS: Although percutaneous vertebroplasty has many benefits, including its simplicity and relative safety, it could lead to serious complications. The current case demonstrates the direct leakage of cement within the anterior spinal artery leading to an irreversible paralysis. The clinicians should be aware of such complications to happen and explain it to their patients.",eng,1.0

Berenson,2006.0,Myeloma bone disease and treatment options,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2005.11.035,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by enhanced bone loss commonly associated with a diffuse osteopenia, focal lytic lesions, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and bony pain. Bone destruction in MM results from asynchronous bone turnover wherein increased osteoclastic bone resorption is not accompanied by a comparable increase in bone formation. Recent characterization of osteoclast-activating factors (OAFs), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK) ligand (RANKL)-osteoprotegerin-RANK system, and inhibitors of Wnt signaling have provided a better understanding of myeloma bone disease in molecular level. The development of minimally invasive surgical procedures such as kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty allows myeloma patients with vertebral compression fractures to have immediate improvement in quality of life and shorter hospital stays. Monthly intravenous infusion of either pamidronate or zoledronic acid have reduced the skeletal complications among MM patients and are now a mainstay of myeloma therapy. Orally administered bisphosphonates, in contrast, have shown little ability to slow the development of skeletal complications in these patients. Although pre-clinical studies suggest nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates have potent anti-tumor effects, clinical trials will be necessary, probably at higher doses given more slowly, to establish their possible anti-tumor effects clinically. As our understanding of the pathophysiology of myeloma bone disease continues to increase, new target therapies will continue to emerge offering new and more advanced options for the management of myeloma bone disease.

Chang,2012.0,Preventive vertebroplasty for adjacent vertebral bodies: a good solution to reduce adjacent vertebral fracture after percutaneous vertebroplasty,10.3174/ajnr.A2898,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adjacent VCF frequently occurs after percutaneous vertebroplasty. Our aim was to evaluate PrVP in the prevention of PVNO-adjacent VCF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiographs of 68 patients who initially presented with a single-level unhealed fracture and underwent vertebroplasty were retrospectively reviewed for the occurrence of PVNO fracture. Patients in the nonpreventive group (n = 33) underwent TVP only for a vertebra with an unhealed fracture. The preventive group (n = 35) underwent PrVP combined with TVP. We injected bone cement into the caudal part of the superior adjacent vertebra and the cephalic part of the inferior adjacent vertebra to perform PrVP. RESULTS: The incidences of PVNO fracture in adjacent vertebra next to a vertebra cemented at the patient's first vertebroplasty (within 6 months: 24% versus 3%, P = .012; within 1 year: 30% versus 3%, P = .006; >4 years: 39% versus 3%, P = .006) markedly decreased in the preventive group compared with the nonpreventive group. PVNO fracture was found in 26% of vertebrae adjacent to the first TVP level in the nonpreventive group and in 2% of vertebrae adjacent to a PrVP level in the preventive group after inclusion of all PrVP procedures. Approximately 33% of patients in the nonpreventive group underwent repeat vertebroplasty, mainly due to adjacent fractures. Only 3% of patients in the preventive group underwent repeated procedures.

Leaks of cement were classified into three types: those via the basivertebral vein (type B), via the segmental vein (type S), and through a cortical defect (type C). More leaks were identified on CT scans than on radiographs by a factor of 1.5 (74/49). Most type-B (93%) and type-S (86%) leaks were missed or underestimated on a lateral radiograph which is usually the only view used during the injection of cement. Of the leaks into the spinal canal, only 7% (2/28) were correctly identified on radiographs. The areas on lateral radiographs where this type of leak may be observed were divided into four zones, and their diagnostic value in predicting a leak into the spinal canal was evaluated. The results showed that cement in the neural foramina had the highest positive predictive value (86%).",eng,0.0

Sixty-five patients who could be followed up for more than 2 years with thoracic and lumbar spine osteoporotic compression fractures, between January 2005 and October 2010, were reviewed. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the type of management: group 1, non-operated group treated conservatively; group 2, operated group that underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty. We assessed the clinical and radiological changes at postoperative and follow-up periods in both groups.The male-to-female ratio and mean age of the patients were 11:54 and 73.04 years (range, 50 - 90 years), respectively. The location and number of treated vertebrae were as follows: T4 = 1, T6 = 1, T7 = 3, T8 = 1, T9 = 2, T10 = 1, T11 = 8, T12 = 11, L1 = 17, L2 = 10, L3 = 6, L4 = 3, and L5 = 1. The mean T-score was -3.37. The overall VAS score and the VAS score until 6 months post-injury were statistically more improved in group 2 than in group 1 (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively). Overall, the compression ratio was statistically more improved in group 2 than in group 1 (P < 0.05).Early pain control and restoration of the compressed vertebral body are the beneficial and real effects of percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients with thoracolumbar osteoporotic compression fractures.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and associated risk factors of new symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) in patients treated by percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and kyphoplasty (PKP) versus conservative treatment, and to elucidate our findings. There are a lot of reports concerning the feasibility and efficacy of this minimally invasive procedure compared with conservative treatment, especially in pain soothing. However, it is still unclear whether the risk of subsequent fracture has increased among operative treatment patients in the long term. METHODS: From November 2005 to July 2009, 290 consecutive patients with 363 OVCFs were randomly selected for PVP/PKP or conservative treatment and evaluated with a mean follow-up of 49.4 months (36-80 months). Some parameters were characterized and statistically compared in this study. Telephone questionnaires, clinical reexamine, and plain radiographs were performed in the follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty-one of 290 (10.7%) patients had experienced 42 newly developed symptomatic secondary OVCFs. Among 169 operation (53.3% vertebroplasty, 46.7% kyphoplasty) and 121 comparison patients, there is no significant statistical difference of new OVCFs incidence between the two groups calculated by patient proportion. However, in separate, the rate of secondary adjacent fractures calculated by vertebral refracture number is significantly higher than non-adjacent levels in PVP/PKP group but no significant statistical difference was observed in conservative group. The time interval of recompression after operative procedure was much shorter than that for comparison group (9.7 +/- 17.8 versus 22.4 +/- 7.99 months, p = 0.017). In addition, older age, gender, fracture times, location of original fracture segment, the amount of cement, cement leakage, operation modality (PVP or PKP),and initial number of OVCFs were documented, but these were not the influencing factors in this study (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had experienced PVP/PKP were not associated with an increased risk of recompression in new levels. However, recompression in new levels of PVP/PKP group occurred much sooner than that of conservative group in the follow-up period. The incidence of new vertebral fractures observed at adjacent levels was substantially higher but no sooner than at distant levels in PVP/PKP group. No major risk factors involving new OVCFs have been found in this study and augmentation for sandwich situation is not necessary.",eng,1.0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thoracolumbar vertebral specimens from adult human cadavers were made into models of compression fractures. The models were divided into group A, which received percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP), balloon dilation, and nitinol memory alloy vertebral stent implantation (PKP + nitinol stent group); group B, which received percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and direct implantation of a nitinol memory alloy vertebral stent (PVP + nitinol stent group); and group C, which received PKP, balloon dilation, and bone cement vertebroplasty (PKP + polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) group). Vertebral heights were measured before and after the surgery and the water bath incubation to compare the impact of the 3 different surgical approaches on reducing vertebral compression. RESULTS: The 3 surgical groups could all significantly restore the heights of compressed vertebral bodies. The vertebral heights of the PKP + nitinol stent group, PVP + nitinol stent group, and PKP + PMMA group were changed from the preoperative levels of (1.59+/-0.08) cm, (1.68+/-0.08) cm, and (1.66+/-0.11) cm to the postoperative levels of (2.00+/-0.09) cm, (1.87+/-0.04) cm, and (1.99+/-0.09) cm, respectively. After the water bath, the vertebral heights of each group were changed to (2.10+/-0.07) cm, (1.98+/-0.09) cm, and (2.00+/-0.10) cm, respectively. Pairwise comparison of the differences between the preoperative and postoperative vertebral heights showed that group A and group B differed significantly (P=0.000); group B and group C differed significantly (P=0.003); and group A and group C had no significant difference (P=0.172).

VCF may either be osteoporotic or tumor-associated. Two hundred million women are affected by osteoporosis globally. Vertebral fracture may result in acute pain around the fracture site, loss of vertebral height due to vertebral collapse, spinal instability, and kyphotic deformity. The main goal of the PV and PK procedures is to give immediate pain relief to patients and restore the vertebral height lost due to fracture. In percutaneous vertebroplasty, bone cement is injected through a minimal incision into the fractured site. Kyphoplasty involves insertion of a balloon into the fractured site, followed by inflation-deflation to create a cavity into which the filler material is injected, and the balloon is taken out prior to cement injection. This literature review presents a qualitative overview on the current status of vertebral augmentation procedures,especially PV and PK, and compares the efficacy and safety of these 2 procedures.

METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled study was performed on 22 patients with mid-thoracic OVCF between September 2012 and June 2014. PKP was performed by unilateral approach in 11 cases (group A) and by bilateral approaches in 11 cases (group B). There was no significant difference in gender, age, causes of injury, disease duration, affected segment, preoperative bone mineral density, Cobb angle, compression rate of the anterior verterbral height, and Visual analogue scale (VAS) score between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The operation time, perspective times, hospitalization expenses, the leakage of cement, the sagittal Cobb angle, compression rate of the anterior vertebral height, and VAS scores were compared between 2 groups. RESULTS: The operation time, perspective times, and hospitalization expenses of group A were significantly less than those of group B (P < 0.05).

Radiographs of the samples were taken before and after screw adjustment, and pullout strength testing was performed. In the cement group, a radiolucent cavity was present after screwing in due to the screw-cement complex migrating downward, whereas no obvious change in the boneicement complex existed after screwing out. Mean pullout strength was significantly higher in the groups with cement as compared to those without cement. However, in the cement groups, the screw-in group had the lowest mean pullout strength among 3 groups, and the mean pullout strength in the screw-out group was also significantly lower than that in the in situ group (P<.05).Adjustment of pedicle screw height after cement augmentation in a severely osteoporotic spine can significantly reduce the pullout strength of the screw.",eng,0.0

Herein, we compare the therapeutic effect of vertebral perforation and conventional vertebroplasty for treating VCFs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight patients with single painful VCFs were assigned to undergo vertebral perforation (perforation group) or vertebroplasty (PVP group). Clinical outcomes were assessed by using the VAS. The associations of analgesic effect and clinical factors were also analyzed by multivariate regression. Plain radiographs were used to quantify the progression of vertebral body compression after surgery and to evaluate cement leakage and new vertebral fractures. The median follow-up time was 10 months. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. No factors correlated with analgesic effects in the PVP group. The analgesic effect of vertebral perforation was, however, related to the preoperative severity of vertebral compression and was low in patients with severe deformity (P < .05). Among patients with preoperative vertebral percentage of compression below 30%, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in analgesic effect at any postoperative intervals. Progression of vertebral compression after surgery occurred in 22.2% and 16.0% of treated vertebrae in the perforation and PVP groups, respectively (P = .38). Respectively, 3.7% and 20.0% of the perforation and PVP groups had new postoperative fractures during follow-up (P < .05). There were no other complications.

This study aims to examine the therapeutic effects and clinical characteristics in patients undergoing a second vertebroplasty for these new fractures. METHODS: The initial treatment group included 182 patients (276 vertebrae) who underwent vertebroplasty. Among 182 patients, the second treatment group included 34 patients (36 vertebrae) who developed new fractures postoperatively, which were retreated. Analgesic effects on the day following surgery, frequency of new fractures during the 12 month period after surgery, and other clinical characteristics were compared between the initial and second treatment groups. Furthermore, similar comparisons were performed between patients with adjacent and non-adjacent vertebral fractures in the second treatment group. RESULTS: The improvement rates in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after surgery were 83.4% in the initial treatment group and 85.6% in the second treatment group (P = 0.27). The frequencies of new fractures occurring within 12 months after surgery were 20.9% and 20.6%, respectively. Within the second treatment group, the VAS improvement rates were 76.7% in the adjacent and 88.2% in the non-adjacent vertebral fracture groups (P = 0.83). However, the frequencies of subsequent new fractures after the second treatment were 31.6% and 5.9%, respectively, being significantly higher in the adjacent vertebral fracture group (P < 0.05).

We compared the outcomes of KP and VP, taking into account the presence of vertebral mobility, to determine whether the balloon inflation in KP may contribute to postoperative resolution of the vertebral deformities in patients with VCFs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects had 34 vertebral bodies treated by VP, and 43 vertebral bodies treated by KP. In all patients, preoperative dynamic imaging was performed to assess the presence of vertebral mobility. First, the vertebral height restoration and kyphotic change were compared between the VP and KP groups. Then, the patients were further divided into 2 groups on the basis of the presence of vertebral mobility, and they were compared within and between the VP and KP groups in relation to the presence of vertebral mobility. RESULTS: Overall, no significant differences were observed in either the vertebral height restoration or kyphotic change between the VP and KP groups (P > .20). Preoperative dynamic imaging identified 19 vertebral bodies each with vertebral mobility in the VP (56%) and KP groups (44%) (P = .21).

This study aims to assess the validity of cement infusion performed for pain relief based on the presence or absence of pseudoarthrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared therapeutic effects between PVP and vertebral perforation without bone cement infusion in patients with painful VCF. The subjects were 64 patients undergoing PVP (PVP group) and 67 undergoing vertebral perforation (perforation group). In all patients, preoperative dynamic radiography was performed to assess the presence of vertebral mobility. Patients were classified into 2 groups, those with and those without vertebral mobility, and changes in VAS and ADL scores before and after surgery were compared between the PVP and perforation groups. RESULTS: Regarding patients with vertebral mobility, VAS improved during the 3 months immediately after surgery in the PVP group compared with the perforation group (P < .05). Although no significant difference in postoperative ADL scores was observed between the 2 treatment groups, the scores 3 months after surgery were better in the PVP group than in the perforation group. Meanwhile, in the subgroup of patients without vertebral mobility, both treatments produced marked pain relief, but the difference was not significant (P > .05).

The present study aimed to analyze the changes in total spinal alignment after Kyphoplasty in VCF patients. METHODS: The study involved 21 VCF patients who underwent Kyphoplasty. In all patients, lateral radiographs of the entire spine were taken preoperatively and 1 month after surgery, to measure the pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT), lumbar lordosis (LL), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and spinosacral angle (SSA). These parameters were compared between VCF patients and 30 healthy volunteers. In VCF patients, the parameters were compared before and after Kyphoplasty. RESULTS: In VCF patients, preoperative SVA was 7.00 +/- 3.9 cm, showing a significant shift to anterior sagittal balance as compared to the healthy group (1.45 +/- 2.7 cm) (P < 0.0001). Preoperative SS was smaller and PT was larger in VCF group than in the healthy group (P < 0.05). After Kyphoplasty, SVA decreased to 5.02 +/- 2.91 (P = 0.0007) and LL and SSA increased (LL P = 0.028; SSA P = 0.0031). Postoperative decrease of SVA was correlated with the kyphotic change of treated vertebra (r = 0.792, P < 0.01).

Analgesic effects before and after surgery were compared between 2 groups. Furthermore, the frequency of new VCFs during the follow-up period was compared. RESULTS: In both groups, the visual analog scale (VAS) scores markedly decreased immediately after surgery and remained low until 90 days after surgery (p < 0.05). However, in the Perforation group, the analgesic effect from postoperative day 7 to 90 was significantly lower in patients with vertebral mobility before surgery than those without mobility (p < 0.05). New fractures after surgery occurred in 12 (42.9%) of the 28 patients in the Vertebroplasty group and 8 (29.6%) of the 27 patients in the Perforation group (p =0.054).

Here, we retrospectively assessed the long-term therapeutic effects of vertebroplasty in a comparison with those of vertebral perforation. The subjects were 64 patients who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP group) and 67 patients who underwent vertebral perforation (Perforation group) between 2006 and 2011 at Takeda general hospital. We compared the analgesic effects of the treatments and the incidences of new VCFs between the groups at 15 months postsurgery. The pain scores on a visual analog scale 15 months postsurgery were 2.3 +/- 2.0 in the PVP group and 2.1 +/- 1.4 in the Perforation group, a nonsignificant difference (p = .90). The presence of vertebral mobility did not influence the analgesic effect in either group. New VCFs developed at a significantly higher rate in the PVP group (n = 27, 52%) compared to the Perforation group (n = 11, 24%; p = .0017). This difference was even greater within 3 months of the surgery, in 19 PVP patients (38%) and two Perforation patients (3.0%; p < .0001). However, the incidence after 3 months was eight PVP patients and nine Perforation patients, a nonsignificant difference (p = .50). The Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that the new fractures after surgery in both treatment groups may occur at the same frequency at around 31 months postoperatively.

OBJECTIVE: This study assesses single-stage thoracic vertebrectomy with circumferential reconstruction and stabilization. Preoperative and postoperative thoracic kyphotic angles and other outcomes are analyzed. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pathologic and traumatic thoracic vertebral body fracture deformity can be corrected by an anterior vertebral body corpectomy and reconstruction. If the pathology is primarily posterior, then laminectomy and posterolateral instrumentation may be preferred. In some patients, simultaneous anterior and posterior correction of instability and fracture is necessary and is now possible with a single-stage Stanford University Medical Center (SUMC) technique with similar results to the traditional 2-stage approach. METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent 31 single-stage thoracic vertebrectomies with circumferential reconstructions for thoracic spine fractures between 2004 and 2006 at SUMC were retrospectively reviewed. All surgeries were performed prone; operative technical details are reported. The preoperative and postoperative thoracic kyphotic angles were measured by Cobb angle evaluation using lateral chest plain films and magnetic resonance imaging. Other outcome measures evaluated included operative time, blood loss, neurologic and functional outcomes, postoperative pain, and treatment complications. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 17.21 months (range: 9 to 30 mo) and preoperative kyphosis was 20.4 degrees (range: 6.0 to 57.9 degrees). The average postoperative kyphosis was 8.3 degrees (range: 1.8 to 2.67 degrees) and correction of kyphosis was 16.2 degrees (range: 6 to 30 degrees). The median estimated blood loss was 1411.67 mL (range: 300 to 4000 mL) and mean operating time was 4.8 hours (range: 2.8 to 8.6 h). Complications included 2 hardware failures requiring revision, 2 infections, and 1 dural laceration. Pain, Frankel Grade, and functional status were improved in all, except 1 preoperatively bedridden patient. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic kyphotic correction is possible through a prone single-stage simultaneous anterior vertebrectomy and posterior reconstruction. Sufficient anterior and posterior correction of instability and fracture using the SUMC technique is possible with similar results to the traditional 2-stage approach.",eng,0.0

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the 244 patients treated with PVP from September 2006 to February 2011. Among these patients, we selected 49 patients with newly developed VCFs following PVP as the new VCFs group, and the remaining 195 patients as the no VCFs group. The new VCFs group was further divided into 2 groups : an adjacent fractures group and a nonadjacent fractures group. The following data were collected from the groups : age, gender, body weight/height, body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density (BMD) score of the spine and femur, level of initial fracture, restoration rate of anterior/middle vertebral height, and intradiscal cement leakage, volume of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). RESULTS: Age, gender, mean body height/weight, mean BMI and volume of PMMA of each of the group are not statistically significantly associated with fractures. In comparison between the new VCFs group and the no VCFs group, lower BMD, intradiscal cement leakage and anterior vertebral height restoration were the significant predictive factors of the fracture. In addition, new VCFs occurrence at the adjacent spines was statistically significant, when the initial fracture levels were confined to the thoracolumbar junction, among the subgroups of new VCFs. CONCLUSION: Lower spinal BMD, the greater anterior vertebral height restoration rate and intradiscal cement leakage were confirmed as risk factors for newly formed VCFs after PVP.",eng,1.0

OBJECTIVE: To alert clinicians to the potential occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome following use of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema has not been reported following intravertebral injection of polymethylmethacrylate. METHODS: A 68-year-old woman underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty for a painful L5 compression fracture under local anesthesia. A contralateral transpedicular approach was made to inject polymethylmethacrylate. RESULTS: On the third postoperative day, she developed arthralgia, myalgia, fever, and frequent coughing. Chest radiography revealed bilateral, multifocal, patchy consolidations, suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and a 5-cm-long tubular radiopacity in the right pulmonary artery. She died 20 days after the vertebroplasty. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates that clinicians must be aware of the potential occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients who received percutaneous vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

Kim,2005.0,Surgical management of spinal disease in renal recipients,10.1111/j.1399-0012.2005.00368.x,"OBJECT AND BACKGROUND: The survival of renal recipients improved dramatically and long-term survival of renal graft patients is common, which in turn increases the chance of these patients requiring spinal surgery. However, there are few appropriate reports about the results of spine surgery on renal recipients. This study was undertaken to analyze the authors' experience of spine surgery after renal transplantation. METHODS: Thirty-two renal recipients who underwent spine surgery with regular follow-up of more than 24 months were included in this study. The patients' medical records and the radiological reports were reviewed retrospectively and their postoperative conditions were evaluated during their regular visits or by telephone. RESULTS: The mean duration from the renal transplantation to spinal surgery was 6 +/- 1.2 yr. Among spinal diseases of renal recipients, there were 23 cases of degenerative spinal diseases, seven cases of vertebral compression fracture, and two spinal cord tumors. The operation methods were conventional spine surgery with or without bone fusion (27 cases), percutaneous vertebroplasty (three cases) and tumor resection (two cases). The mean values of the Prolo scale in the preoperative (4.5 +/- 0.3) and postoperative (7.4 +/- 0.4) period showed significant clinical improvement after the operation. Postoperative renal function was not deteriorated in any patients and there were no major complications. CONCLUSION: Spine surgery can be performed with acceptable clinical results and without major complications in renal recipients. Spine surgery has no aggravating effect on the patients' renal function. Surgery is a valuable, safe option for the treatment of spinal disease in this rare distinct group of patients.",eng,1.0

Disruption of the weight-bearing unit of the second cervical (C2) vertebral body causes excessive load at the relatively small adjacent upper cervical joints. Upper cervical joint block before or after PVP at the C2 level has not been reported thus far. A 67-year-old man was referred to a pain clinic with a 6-month history of increasing neck pain without focal neurologic symptoms. Studies revealed a compression fracture of the C2 vertebral body and invasion of the adjacent soft tissue. To treat the mechanical component of the symptoms, anterolateral PVP at C2 was successfully performed, but the residual suboccipital headache was alleviated only after upper cervical joint block was performed. Thus, upper cervical joint block can be performed to treat the residual suboccipital headache after PVP at C2.",eng,0.0

Two minimally invasive surgical approaches were developed for the management of symptomatic VCFs: balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of symptomatic VCFs. METHODS: Between July 2011 and June 2012, one hundred and eighty-seven patients with two hundred and fifty-one vertebras received balloon kyphoplasty in our hospital. There were sixty-five male and one hundred and twenty-two female patients with an average age of 74.5 (range, 61 to 95 years). The pain symptoms and quality of life, were measured before operation and at one day, three months, six months and one year following kyphoplasty. Radiographic data including restoration of kyphotic angle, anterior vertebral height, and any leakage of cement were defined. RESULTS: The mean visual analog pain scale decreased from a preoperative value of 7.7 to 2.2 at one day (p < .05) following operation and the Oswestry Disability Index improved from 56.8 to 18.3 (p < .05). The kyphotic angle improved from a mean of 14.4 degrees before surgery to 6.7 degrees at one day after surgery (p < .05). The mean anterior vertebral height increased significantly from 52% before surgery to 74.5% at one day after surgery (p < .05) and 70.2% at one year follow-up. Minor cement extravasations were observed in twenty-nine out of two hundred and fifty-one procedures, including six leakage via basivertebral vein, three leakage via segmental vein and twenty leakage through a cortical defect. None of the leakages were associated with any clinical consequences. CONCLUSIONS: Balloon kyphoplasty not only rapidly reduced pain and disability but also restored sagittal alignment in our patients at one-year follow-up. The treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with balloon kyphoplasty is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive procedure that provides satisfactory clinical results.",eng,0.0

We herein report a case of pyogenic spondylitis that occurred after the patient had undergone vertebroplasty. METHODS: A 78-year-old woman with a T12 osteoporotic compression fracture, and without a magnetic resonance imaging sign of infection, underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty using polymethyl methacrylate without complication. RESULTS.: About 1 month after the operation, the patient was readmitted because of severe backache, and the diagnosis of pyogenic spondylitis was made using radiograph and magnetic resonance imaging. Anterior inter-body fusion with a strut bone graft after debridement and posterior instrumentation were then performed. CONCLUSIONS: Vertebroplasty should proceed under sterile conditions.

This study compared the results of vertebroplasty used at the different stages of injury. METHODS: A retrospective study reviewing the period between January 2001 and July 2001 investigated 68 patients who underwent single-level vertebroplasty: 22 patients within 2 weeks of the injury, 22 patients 2 weeks to 2 months after the injury, and 24 patients more than 2 months after the injury. Clinical evaluations compared the results of treatment at different injury stages during a mean follow-up period of 13 months. RESULTS: Although all the patients undergoing vertebroplasty in the acute and subacute stages reported satisfaction within 1 week of the operation, only 72.7% of the acute-stage group reported satisfaction with 24 hours of surgery. Moreover, evidence of cement leakage after vertebroplasty was detected for 27.3% of the acute-stage patients. This percentage significantly higher than for the patients in the subacute and chronic stages. Radiographic examination showed that new, adjacent compression fracture had occurred for 10.3% of the patients, with anterior interbody restabilization occurring for 11.8%. CONCLUSIONS: The results for vertebroplasty treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures appear to be injury stage dependent, with patients in the acute-injury stage needing longer recovery times, and with cement leakage quite common. These findings lead to the conclusion that the subacute stage is optimal for vertebroplasty. Furthermore, it is suggested that the use of spinal orthoses and postsurgical supplementation for the bone matrix reduces the risk of new, adjacent compression fractures and increases anterior interbody restabilization. Importantly, the findings suggest that a presurgical magnetic resonance imaging evaluation is an absolute necessity.",eng,1.0

However, few reports are available in the management of multiple-level compression fractures due to severe osteoporosis. This study prospectively evaluated the clinical and surgical outcomes of patients receiving vertebroplasty due to multiple-level osteoporotic spinal compression fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients underwent more than four levels of vertebroplasty due to multiple-level osteoporotic spinal compression fracture. All patients received a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) check-up to determine which level needed vertebroplasty. Detailed evaluations were made in accordance with the patients' clinical tracking, pre- and postoperative daily activities, Denis pain scale, and Roland-Morris score. RESULTS: After an average follow-up period of 36 months, the group receiving multiple-level vertebroplasty showed significant improvement, as registered on the Denis pain scale, Roland-Morris score, and in the activity of daily living. No major complications occurred during operation or postoperation, except one patient who expired due to suffocation at the rehabilitation center 3 weeks after vertebroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: The use of vertebroplasty with cement to treat multiple-level osteoporotic spinal compression fractures in the elderly does have value, and brings good results to patients which were previously unimaginable. Preoperative MRI to evaluate the non-union levels and determine which levels needed vertebroplasty is very important.",eng,1.0

The follow-up period was at least 2 years. Vertebral height loss >/=15% or kyphotic angle >/=10 degrees at the final follow-up in relation to the immediately postoperative values were adopted as a definition of recollapse of the augmented vertebrae. Correlation analysis and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to elucidate the related clinical or radiological factors for recollapse of the augmented vertebrae including age, gender, bone mineral density, preoperative fracture severity, locations of IVC sign, distribution patterns of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), reduction rate, and reduction angle.Assuming the increase of height loss more than 15% as a criterion of recollapse, only cleft filling pattern of PMMA in the IVC area was a significant risk factor for recollapse of the augmented vertebrae (P < 0.01). Assuming >/=10 degrees progression of kyphotic angle as a criterion, cleft filling pattern of PMMA and higher values of reduction angle was as 2 significant risk factors for recollapse of the augmented vertebrae (P < 0.01). No significant difference was found in other clinical and radiological factors (P > 0.05).Cleft filling pattern of PMMA and higher values of reduction angle may play an important role in inducing recollapse of the augmented vertebrae after PVP for OVCFs with the IVC.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to calculate a pooled estimate of the IVCs on the effect of therapeutic efficacy of PVA for the treatment of OVCFs. METHODS: A systematic electronic literature search was performed using the following databases: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library; the databases were searched from the earliest available records up to June 2016. Pooled risk ratio (RR) or a mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using random- or fixed-effects models. The RevMan 5.2 was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: In the immediate postoperative period, pooled results showed that vertebral height and VAS scores of the IVC patients were significantly lower than those of the non-IVC patients. However, pooled results showed there was no significant difference in kyphotic angle and ODI indices between the two groups. At final follow-up period, significant difference was observed in all the radiological and clinical parameters for the IVC patients with compared to the non-IVC patients in our pooled results. Pooled results showed significant difference with respect to the rate of cement leakage between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The IVCs had an important effect of therapeutic efficacy in PVA for the treatment OVCFs.

OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course. BACKGROUND: An atypical presentation of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma was diagnosed from a metastatic nodule on the chest wall. CASE REPORT: The patient was a 60-year-old female who presented with intractable back pain with an MRI showing an L3 compression fracture and multiple lesions in L3, L5, and the pelvis. The patient had a 40-pack-year smoking history. On admission, a small, non-tender nodule was noted under her left breast on the chest wall. CT and PET scan confirmed diffuse metastases in the lumbar spine, brain, lung, liver, and pancreas, without knowing the primary site. The patient underwent L3 vertebroplasty and removal of the nodule on the chest wall. The pathology report of the nodule showed large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for cytokeratin AE 1/3, TTF-1, CD56, Synaptophysin, and chromogranin. The stains were negative for CK7, Napsin, cytokeratin 20, GATA-3, mammaglobin, and CEA. A pathology diagnosis of metastatic LCNEC was made, with the lung as the most likely original site. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment consisted of pain control through an intra-thecal pump and whole brain radiation followed by systemic chemotherapy. This case elucidates the unusual cutaneous metastatic site for LCNECs, which was biopsied to confirm the diagnosis. This is the first case of LCNEC diagnosed by a cutaneous metastasis. In conclusion, it is possible to diagnose LCNEC of the lung at a distant metastatic site with careful histological and immunohistochemical examination, which can spare patients from more harmful biopsies.",eng,0.0

METHODS: 27 consecutive osteoporosis patients with a variety of spinal disorders who underwent 3D navigation-guided PMMA-augmented pedicle screw fixation were evaluated clinically and radiologically in the perioperative and 1-year follow-up period. The improvement of Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores was analyzed. PMMA leakage and other complications were inspected intraoperatively and postoperatively. Screw loosening and bone fusion were evaluated radiographically during follow-up. RESULTS: 8 patients had thoracic and lumbar fractures; 18 patients had degenerative spinal disorders; one patient had revision surgery. One patient died of postoperative pneumonia. Each of the other 26 patients was followed up regularly at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months postoperatively. The mean therapeutic improvement rate is 39.6% evaluated by JOA scores. 2 patients (7.4%) had leakage into the spinal canal in front of the posterior longitudinal ligament and two patients (7.4%) had leakage into the prevertebral soft tissue inspected by the postoperative CT scans. No pedicle cortex breach and cement leakage surrounding pedicle cortex were observed. None of patients complained of dyspnoea and showed evidence of pulmonary embolism. Bone fusions were found in 20 patients (bony fusion rate 76.9%) at the 12-month follow-up and no screw loosening occurs.

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare the outcomes of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty with conservative treatment in patients with osteoporotic VCFs. METHODS: Medline, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched until January 31, 2015 using the keywords: vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, compression fracture, osteoporotic, and osteoporosis. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which patients with osteoporosis, and VCFs were treated with vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty or conservative management. Outcome measures were pain, function, and quality of life. Standardized differences in means were calculated as a measure of effect size. MAIN RESULTS: Ten RCTs were included. The total number of patients in the treatment and control groups was 626 and 628, respectively, the mean patient age ranged from 64 to 80 years, and the majority was female. Vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty was associated with greater pain relief (pooled standardized difference in means = 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.374-1.266, P < 0.001) and a significant improvement in daily function (pooled standardized difference in means = 1.273, 95% CI: 1.028-1.518, P < 0.001) as compared with conservative treatment.

Subgroup analysis of 8 vertebroplasty studies and 2 kyphoplasty studies that reported pain data, however, indicated that vertebroplasty provided greater pain relief than conservative treatment but kyphoplasty did not. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty may provide better pain relief than balloon kyphoplasty in patients with osteoporotic VCFs, both may improve function, and their effect on quality of life is less clear.",eng,0.0

Balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are associated with a recurrent fracture risk in the adjacent levels after the surgical procedure. In certain patient categories with impaired bone metabolism, the risk of subsequent fractures after kyphoplasty is increased. PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of recurrent fractures after kyphoplasty and explore whether the status of bone metabolism and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels affect the occurrence of these fractures. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal clinical study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Forty female postmenopausal women with primary osteoporosis and acute symptomatic vertebral compression fractures. OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of new vertebral fractures and documentation of indicators of bone metabolism. METHODS: A total of ninety-eight kyphoplasties were performed in 40 female patients. Balloon kyphoplasty was performed on all symptomatic acute vertebral compression fractures. Age, body mass index, history of tobacco use, number of initial vertebral fractures, intradiscal cement leakage, history of nonspinal fractures, use of antiosteoporotic medications, bone mineral density, bone turnover markers, and 25(OH)D levels were assessed. All participants were evaluated clinically and/or radiographically. Follow-up period was 18 months. RESULTS: The mean population age was 70.6 years (range, 40-83 years). After initial kyphoplasty procedure, nine patients (11 levels) (22.5% of patients; 11.2% of levels) developed a postkyphoplasty vertebral compression fracture. Cement leakage was identified in seven patients (17.5%). The patients without recurrent fractures after kyphoplasty demonstrated higher levels of 25(OH)D (22.6+/-5.51 vs. 14.39+/-7.47; p=.001) and lower N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide values (17.11+/-10.20 vs. 12.90+/-4.05; p=.067) compared with the patients with recurrent fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Bone metabolism and 25(OH)D levels seem to play a role in the occurrence of postkyphoplasty recurrent vertebral compression fractures.",eng,0.0

McGuire,2010.0,Comparison of 5766 vertebral compression fractures treated with or without kyphoplasty,10.1007/s11999-010-1279-7,"BACKGROUND: The majority of the 700,000 osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) that occur annually in the United States affect women. The total treatment costs exceed $17 billion and approximate the total costs of breast cancer ($13 billion) and heart disease ($19 billion). Balloon-assisted percutaneous vertebral augmentation with bone cement (kyphoplasty) reportedly reduces VCF-related pain and accelerates return of independent functional mobility. Kyphoplasty may decrease overall cost of VCF treatment costs by reducing use of posttreatment medical resources. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We evaluated complications, mortality, posthospital disposition, and treatment costs of kyphoplasty compared with nonoperative treatment using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. METHODS: We identified 5766 VCFs (71% female) in patients 65 years of age or older with nonneoplastic VCF as the primary diagnosis in nonroutine hospital admissions; 15.3% underwent kyphoplasty. Demographic data, medical comorbidities, and fracture treatment type were recorded. Outcomes, including complications, mortality, posthospital disposition, and treatment costs, were compared for each treatment type. RESULTS: Women were more likely to be treated with kyphoplasty than were men. Patients undergoing kyphoplasty had comorbidity indices equivalent to those treated nonoperatively. Kyphoplasty was associated with a greater likelihood of routine discharge to home (38.4% versus 21.0% for nonoperative treatment), a lower rate of discharge to skilled nursing (26.1% versus 34.8%) or other facilities (35.7% versus 47.1%), a complication rate equivalent to nonoperative treatment (1.7% versus 1.0%), and a lower rate of in-hospital mortality (0.3% versus 1.6%). Kyphoplasty was associated with higher cost of hospitalization (mean $37,231 versus $20,112). CONCLUSIONS: Kyphoplasty for treatment of VCF in well-selected patients may accelerate the return of independent patient function as indicated by improved measures of hospital discharge. The initially higher cost of treatment may be offset by the reduced use of posthospital medical resources. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 24 patients with 58 symptomatic vertebral fractures treated by balloon kyphoplasty. Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to assess fracture-related pain and patient's disability: preoperatively and within 12-months follow-up. Following the procedures to evaluate the change of vertebral deformity, the angle of local kyphosis was measured. RESULTS: Preoperative VAS score was 6.54, at discharge it significantly regressed in 95.8% of patients. The overall VAS score at discharge was 1.25 and within 12 months decreased to 0.26. Preoperative ODI score was 50%, at follows-up in all patients it decreased, ranging from 21% to 10%. Reduction of local kyphosis was achieved in 30 (51.7%) vertebrae by average 4.3 degrees . In 9 (37.5%) patients kyphosis of all augmented vertebrae was reduced, in 7 (29.2%) patients procedures reduced kyphosis in part of augmented vertebrae and in 8 patients (33.3%) kyphosis remained unchanged. Asymptomatic complications included cement leak in 10 (17%) vertebrae and intraoperative rupture of 4 (4%) balloons. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid significant pain relief after kyphoplasty followed by long-term pain release and disability reduction obtained in all patients was most probably the result of vertebral augmentation.

OBJECTIVE: The long-term clinical performance of a new cement-directing kyphoplasty system was evaluated for treatment of painful osteoporotic compression fractures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cement leakage is a common clinical complication of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures. Balloon kyphoplasty restricts cement flow and reduces leakage by injection of high-viscosity cement into a compacted bone cavity. Biomechanical reinforcement of surrounding bone is limited, leaving the vertebral body vulnerable to continued collapse. METHODS: The patient population consisted of 20 patients at least 50 years of age with up to 3 painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures between T4-L5. The cement-directing kyphoplasty system procedure was performed unipedicularly using a curved drill and reamer to create a central cavity. The cement-directing implant was positioned inside the cavity and cement was injected through it. A total of 37 levels were treated. Pain relief was assessed using a verbal pain scale. The Roland-Morris Questionnaire was used to evaluate disability. Cement leakage was determined from radiographs (anterior/posterior and lateral) obtained within 24 hours of the procedure. RESULTS: : Significant pain relief was achieved immediately after the procedure, as shown by a decrease in the mean pain scores from 8.20 (+/-1.40) measured preoperatively to 2.85 (+/-2.13) measured postoperatively. Pain relief was sustained throughout the 2-year follow-up period. Mean Roland-Morris Questionnaire scores improved from 21.8 (+/-3.5) measured preoperatively to 11.6 (+/-5.6) measured 6 weeks postoperatively. The investigators reported 1 moderate cortical leak (2.7%) and an independent reviewer identified 8 additional minor segmental vein and cortical leaks (24.3%). None of the leaks was symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Directed cement flow allows cement to fill the anterior vertebral body, stabilizing fractures and supporting biomechanical loading. Control of cement flow may help minimize the risk of posterior leakage into the basivertebral vein or spinal canal.",eng,0.0

With continuing expansion in clinical use, a broad spectrum of complications has been reported for both interventions. The goal of the current study was to compare the safety of these procedures using a questionnaire completed by practitioners. A questionnaire was developed with multiple choice and open questions. General data as well as information regarding complications which occurred during the year 2007 were requested. The incidence and odds ratios (OR) of complications for both procedures were analysed. One hundred and sixteen questionnaires detailing 3216 VP and 5139 BKP procedures were included for evaluation. The risk of cement extrusion from the vertebra (OR 2.64, p <0.01) and into the spinal canal (OR 435, p <0.01) was markedly increased for VP. The odds ratio for neurologic complications (OR 2.56, p = 0.1) and secondary fracture (OR = 0.99, p = 0.96) did not indicate significant predisposition for either procedure. Secondary fracture occurred in 5% of VP and 5.1% of BKP procedures. Overall, 80% of practitioners subjectively considered BKP the safer procedure. Overall, BKP appears safer than VP. Symptomatic complications are rare with both procedures. Additional prospective data is necessary to reach more definitive conclusions.",eng,0.0

In situations with diminished anterior column support, pedicle screw fixation alone may lead to delayed kyphosis, nonunion, and hardware failure. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty (balloon-assisted vertebroplasty) have been used in an effort to provide anterior column support in traumatic burst fractures. Cited advantages are providing immediate stability, improving pain, and reducing hardware malfunction. When used in isolation or in combination with posterior instrumentation, these techniques theoretically allow for improved fracture reduction and maintenance of spinal alignment while avoiding the complications and morbidity of anterior approaches. Complications associated with cement use (leakage, systemic effects) are similar to those seen in the treatment of osteoporotic compression fractures; however, extreme caution must be used in fractures with a disrupted posterior wall.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Twenty-five patients with severe osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were observed, whose average age was 72 years with average disease history of 12 days and average compression of the affected vertebral bodies of 73%. The patients were divided into 3 groups for 3 different fracture types according to Rao's classification of osteoporotic vertebral structure and deformity, namely wedge type (group A, n= 12), biconcave type (group B, n= 7) and crush type (group C, n=6). Unipedicular approach was adopted in group A, far lateral bipedicular approach in group B, and posterior wall vertebroplasty and pedicle screw fixation in group C. The average follow-up time was 1 year. Visual analog scale (VAS), analgesic use and the mobility were measured in the patients preoperatively and 3 days (7 days in group C) and 6 months after the operation, respectively, and the success rates and complications were observed. RESULTS: All the surgical procedures were successful. The average operation time was 35 min in group A, 50 min in group B, and 2 h in group C. The average volume of cement injected into each vertebral body was 2.0 ml. The average blood loss was 30 ml in groups A and B, and 600 ml in group C. The procedure increased mobility and decreased analgesic use. VAS was decreased by a mean of 4.8 in Group A, 6.2 in group B 3 days after the operation and 5.4 in group C 7 days postoperatively, and remained stable till 6 months after the operation (P<0.01). Cement extravasation occurred in 9 cases, cement in the vertebral canal in 2 cases with transient neurological symptoms, and cement extravasation in the intervertebral space and the anterior space of the vertebral bodies took place in 5 and 2 cases, respectively. No neurological complications were observed. CONCLUSION: Different types of severe osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures require management with different approaches of vertebroplasty for adequate filling of the remaining vertebral body, which provides significant pain relief with wider indications.",chi,0.0

Yang,2017.0,Risk Factors for Cement Leakage After Vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty: A Meta-Analysis of Published Evidence,10.1016/j.wneu.2017.01.124,"BACKGROUND: Cement leakage is the most common complication of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. So far, the reported risk factors remain conflicting because of limited data and lack of uniform measurement and evaluation. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of potential risk factors for cement leakage after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. METHODS: Relevant literature was retrieved using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, and MEDLINE with no language restriction, supplemented by a hand search of the reference lists of selected articles. A fixed-effects model was used if homogeneity existed among included studies; otherwise, a random-effects model was used. The results were presented with weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Twenty-two studies consisting of 2872 patients with 4187 vertebrae were included in the meta-analysis. The incidences of cement leakage for percutaneous vertebroplasty and percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty were 54.7% and 18.4%, respectively. The significant risk factors for new vertebral compression fractures were intravertebral cleft (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.09-1.78; P < 0.01), cortical disruption (OR, 5.56; 95% CI, 1.84-16.81; P < 0.01), cement viscosity (OR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.36-8.07; P < 0.01) and injected cement volume (weighted mean difference, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.02-1.17; P < 0.05). Age, sex and fracture type, operation level, and surgical approach were not significant risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that patients with intravertebral cleft, cortical disruption, low cement viscosity, and high volume of injected cement may be at high risk for cement leakage after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Rigorous patient selection and individual therapeutic strategy irrespective of age, sex and fracture type, operation level, and surgical approach may reduce the occurrence of cement leakage. Given the inherent limitation of the meta-analysis, more large sample-sized randomized controlled trials are needed to further validate the present findings.",eng,0.0

METHODS: Between January 2008 and June 2011, 59 patients with T12, L1 segment thoracolumbar osteoporotic compression fracture were treated with PVP in 29 cases (PVP group) and PKP in 30 cases (PKP group), who were in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. No significant difference was found in gender, duration of menopause, disease druation, causes of injury, fractured vertebral body, and vertebral fracture classification between 2 groups (P > 0.05). The kyphosis Cobb angle of surgical area was measured at preoperation, 1 week after operation, and last follow-up; the lower three lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) of the surgical area, the femoral neck BMD, and body mass index (BMI) of patients were measured at perioperative period and last follow-up to find out the statement of anti-osteoporosis; FRAX online tools were used to evaluate the probability of major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture of the next 10 years. RESULTS: The average follow-up was 25.5 months (range, 12-48 months) in 2 groups. There was significant difference in kyphosis Cobb angle of T12, L1 between preoperation and last follow-up in 2 groups (P < 0.05); the Cobb angle of PKP group was significantly less than that of PVP group at 1 week after operation and last follow-up (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found in BMI between 2 groups, and between perioperative period and last follow-up in the same group (P > 0.05). The lower three lumbar spine BMD of the surgical area and its T value at last follow-up was improved significantly when compared with BMD at perioperative period (P < 0.05); there was no significant difference in the lower three lumbar spine BMD and its T value between 2 groups at perioperative period (P > 0.05), but significant difference was found between two groups at last follow-up (P < 0.05). Difference was not significant in the femoral neck BMD and its T value between 2 groups, and between perioperative period and last follow-up in the same group (P > 0.05). The probability of major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture of the next 10 years was not significantly different between 2 groups and between perioperative period and last follow-up in the same group (P > 0.05).

Journal Article,D. J. Zhang; J. T. Chen; D. D. Jin,2006.0,[Kyphoplasty using an enhanced balloon expander: an experimental study],", ","OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of kyphoplasty using an enhanced balloon expander in restoring the height of vertebral compression fractures (OVCF). METHODS: Fifteen lumbar vertebral bodies (L1-L5) were harvested from 3 young male fresh cadavers and separated into individual vertebral bodies with the bilateral pedicles of the vertebral arch removed. Before operation, plain X-ray films of all the vertebral bodies were obtained. All the vertebral bodies were compressed lengthwise to approximately 80% of their original heights using a universal material-testing machine to result in compression fractures. Post-compression vertebral bodies were then repaired using an enhanced balloon expander, and the delivery of the bone cement into the vertebral bodies was observed. The heights of the anterior and posterior borders of the vertebral bodied were measured before and after compression as well as after kyphoplasty. RESULTS: The inflation of the balloon expander averaged 2.95-/+0.18 ml and the pressure was 122.67-/+27.89 psi (1 psi=6895 Pa). Kyphoplasty resulted in significant restoration of the vertebral body height lost due to the compression (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty using an enhanced balloon expander may restore vertebral body height damaged by compression and correct the kyphotic deformity. The balloon expander can be a effective and economic choice for kyphoplasty for its relatively low cost.",chi,0.0

Zhang,2017.0,Does Percutaneous Vertebroplasty or Balloon Kyphoplasty for Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fractures Increase the Incidence of New Vertebral Fractures? A Meta-Analysis,", ","BACKGROUND: Because of an aging population,osteoporotic vertebral fractures are becoming more frequent.Conservative therapy was considered the gold standard for treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) in the past. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) or balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) as minimally invasive techniques are new treatments that are widely used for painful OVCFs. However, an increase in new vertebral compression fractures at non-treated levels following augmentation is of concern. There is no convincing evidence that new fractures are inevitable after augmentation compared to after conservative treatment, and it is still unclear whether further fractures are the consequence of augmentation or a result of the natural progression of osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the new-level fracture risk after PVP or BKP compared with conservative (non-operative) treatment and to determine the dominant risk factor associated with new OVCFs. STUDY DESIGN: A meta-analysis of comparative studies was performed to evaluate the incidence of new vertebral fractures between vertebral augmentation, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, and no operation. SETTING: The PubMed, ISI Web of Science, ELSEVIER ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases and abstracts published in annual proceedings were systematically searched.In addition, we also retrieved data from references when titles met our inclusion criteria. METHODS: Detailed searches of a number of online databases comparing operative and non-operative groups were performed. We included randomized controlled trials,clinical controlled trials,and prospective clinical studies to provide available data. All studies were reviewed by two reviewers independently, and all the references that met our inclusion criteria were searched for additional trials, using the guidelines set by the QUOROM (Quality of Reporting of Meta-analysis) statement. RESULTS: We evaluated 12 studies encompassing 1,328 patients in total, including 768 who underwent operation with polymethylmethacrylateand 560 who received non-operative treatments. For new-level vertebral fractures, our meta-analysis found no significant difference between the 2 methods, including total new fractures (P = 0.55) and adjacent fractures (P = 0.5). For pre-existing vertebral fractures, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (operative and non-operative groups) (P = 0.24). Additionally,there was no significant difference in bone mineral density, both in the lumbar (P = 0 .13) and femoral neck regions (P = 0.37), between the 2 interventions. LIMITATION: All studies we screened were published online except for unpublished articles. Moreover, only a few data sources could be extracted from the published studies.There were only 5 randomized clinical trials and 7 prospective studies that met our inclusion criteria. CONCLUSION: Vertebral augmentation techniques, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have been widely used to treat osteoporotic vertebral fractures in order to alleviate back pain and correct the deformity, and it has been frequently reported that many new vertebral fractures occurred after this operation. Our analysis did not reveal evidence of an increased risk of fracture of vertebral bodies, especially those adjacent to the treated vertebrae, following augmentation with either method compared with conservative treatment.Key words: Vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, new osteoporotic compression vertebral fracture, meta-analysis.",eng,0.0

Limited evidence is available comparing the clinical outcomes and complications in treating osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) with PVP using high-viscosity cement through unipedicular or bipedicular approach. METHODS AND DESIGN: Fifty patients with OVCFs were randomly allocated into two groups adopting unipedicular or bipedicular PVP. The efficacy of unipedicular and bipedicular PVP was assessed by comparing operation time, X-ray exposure time, incidence of complications, vertebral height restoration, and improvement of the visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and Short Form-36 (SF-36) General Health Survey scores. RESULTS: The mean operative and exposure time to X-rays in the unipedicular PVP group was less than that of the bipedicular group (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed in the VAS score, ODI score, SF-36 score, cement leakage rate or vertebral height restoration between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Unipedicular and bipedicular PVP are safe and effective treatments for OVCF. Compared with bipedicular PVP, unipedicular PVP entails a shorter surgical time and lower X-ray irradiation.",eng,0.0

METHODS: From December 2010 to December 2012, 32 patients with severe OVCFs were randomly assigned to either group H using high viscosity cement (n=14) or group L using low viscosity cement (n=18). The clinical outcomes were assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short Form-36 General Health Survey (SF-36), kyphosis Cobb's angle, vertebral height, and complications. RESULTS: Significant improvement in the VAS, ODI, SF-36 scores, kyphosis Cobb's angle, and vertebral height were noted in both the groups, and there were no significant differences between the two groups. Cement leakage was seen less in group H. Postoperative assessment using computed tomography identified cement leakage in 5 of 17 (29.4%) vertebrae in group H and in 15 of 22 (68.2%) vertebrae in group L (P=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: The PVP using high viscosity bone cement can provide the same clinical outcome and fewer complications compared with PVP using low viscosity bone cement.",eng,0.0

Yu,2010.0,The biomechanical effects of osteoporosis vertebral augmentation with cancellous bone granules or bone cement on treated and adjacent non-treated vertebral bodies: a finite element evaluation,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2009.10.006,"BACKGROUND: In order to reduce the complications of bone cement, many efforts are underway to replace bone cement augmentation with cancellous bone granule augmentation for treating compression fractures of osteoporotic vertebral bodies. The goal of this study was to investigate the biomechanical effects of cancellous bone granule augmentation of Optimesh and polymethylmethacrylate augmentation of kyphoplasty on treated and adjacent non-treated vertebral bodies.
METHODS: Three-dimensional, anatomically detailed finite element models of the L1-L2 functional spinal unit were developed on the basis of cadaver computed tomography scans. The material properties and plug forms of the L2 centrum were adapted to simulate osteoporosis, cancellous bone granule and polymethylmethacrylate augmentation. The models assumed a three-column loading configuration as the following types: compression, flexion and extension.
FINDINGS: Compared with the osteoporotic model, changes in stress and strain at adjacent levels both of cancellous bone granule and polymethylmethacrylate augmentation models were minimal, but stresses/strains within the two reinforcement material plugs were modified distinctly and differently. In addition, osteoporosis and augmentation had little effect on either the axial compressive displacement of the three columns or the average disc internal pressure in all models.
INTERPRETATION: Both cancellous bone granule and polymethylmethacrylate augmentation restore the total strength and stiffness level of treated vertebral bodies and benefit the reconstruction of vertebral function. Regarding the material mechanical compatibility and the biocompatibility of the treated vertebral body and reinforcement material, however, the morcelized cancellous bone is better than polymethylmethacrylate augmentation.

Yang,2013.0,Treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures: short-segment pedicle instrumentation versus kyphoplasty,", ","UNLABELLED: The management of amyelic thoracolumbar burst fractures remains controversial. In this study, we compared the clinical efficacy of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) and short-segment pedicle instrumentation (SSPI). Twenty-three patients were treated with PKP, and 25 patients with SSPI. They all presented with Type A3 amyelic thoracolumbar fractures. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at two years follow-up. Radiographic data including the anterior and posterior vertebral body height, kyphotic angle, as well as spinal canal compromise was also evaluated. The patients in both groups were similar regarding age, bone mineral density (BMD), follow-up period, severity of the deformity and fracture. Blood loss, operation time, and bed-rest time were less in the PKP group. VAS, ODI score improved more rapidly after surgery in the PKP group. No significant difference was found in VAS and ODI scores between the two groups at final follow-up (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, the height of anterior vertebrae (Ha), the height of posterior vertebrae (Hp) and the kyphosis angle showed significant improvement in each group (p < 0.05). The postoperative improvement in spinal canal compromise was not statistically significant in the PKP group (p > 0.05); there was a significant improvement in the SSPI group (p < 0.05). Moreover, these postoperative radiographic assessments showed significant differences between the two groups regarding the improvement of canal compromise (p < 0.05). At final follow-up, remodeling of spinal canal compromise was detected in both groups. CONCLUSION: Both PKP and SSPI appeared as effective and reliable operative techniques for selected amyelic thoracolumbar fractures in the short-term. PKP had a significantly smaller blood loss and shorter bed-rest time, but SSPI provided a better reduction. Long-time studies should be conducted to support these clinical outcomes.",eng,0.0

However, the matter of which surgical approach should be selected remains controversial. This research aims to compare the clinical results of unilateral and bilateral PVP for AOVF. METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2011, 68 patients with AOVF were randomly assigned to the unilateral puncture group (n=36) or the bilateral group (n=32). These patients underwent percutaneous injection of polymethyl methacrylate into posterior pedicle by the unilateral or bilateral puncture approach. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO) were recorded on presentation, at 1 week, 3, 6, and 12 months after operation. The cement leakage was measured by x-ray and computed tomography scan. RESULTS: Follow-up data showed there were no significant differences in VAS and QUALEFFO between 2 groups at 1 week after PVP and only significant difference was observed between 2 groups at 3, 6, and 12 months after operation. The cement leakage was 52.7% in the unilateral puncture group and 28.1% in the bilateral group. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with unilateral puncture, use of bilateral approach during PVP may result in more superior long-term outcomes and less cement leakage for patients with AOVF.",eng,1.0

Osteoporotic vertebral model was induced in each vertebra using decalcifying chemical agents, and was then compressed to determine their initial strength and stiffness before injecting the cement. Thirty vertebral bodies were divided randomly into geneX((R)) cement group, CSC group, and PMMA group. The fractures were repaired using a transpedicular injection of cements and re-compressed to measure posttreatment strength and stiffness. RESULTS: The normal mean BMD of the calf vertebra was 1.425-/+0.072 g/cm(2), which was reduced significantly to 1.074-/+0.065 g/cm(2) after decalcification. The mean injected volume was similar between geneX((R)) (4.5-/+0.7 ml), CSC (4.3-/+0.8 ml) and PMMA (3.8-/+0.4 ml) groups.

There were 10 males and 31 females, ranging in age from 61 to 83 years, with an average of 67.5 years. Fracture site was from T9 to L4 including 65 vertebral bodies. Clinical symptom was lumbar and back pain to affect orthobiosis. The pain, height of vertebral body, Cobb angle, function of daily activities were analyzed by VAS sore, imaging data, Oswestry score before and after operation. RESULTS: All operations were successful and no severe complications were found. Bone cement leakage occurred in 7 vertebrae, but no clinical sympton.

Except for conservative therapy (CT), percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) are another two the common choices, but current evaluation of their efficacy is not performed. All the trial data were originated from electronic database including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Four indicators with mean difference (MD) or odd ratio (OR) with their 95% credible interval (95% CrI) were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy, including the value of visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), relieving kyphotic angle (KA), and rate of fracture. Besides, the results were demonstrated in the forest plots and slash tables. Furthermore, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was calculated. A total of 32 trials among 2,852 patients are included. Using network comparison, we found that PKP and PVP both have good performance as OVCF treatments. However, in different aspects, PKP seemed to be the best to eliminate pain with high value of SUCRA on ODI and VAS (0.624 and 0.588, respectively), and PVP had better performance in KA and decreasing incidence of fracture. The micro-operative therapy, both PKP and PVP, had better efficacy than CT in four aspects.

The effectiveness was determined by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The height and the kyphotic Cobb angle of the involved vertebral body were measured pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS: The operation was successfully completed in all the patients, and the incisions healed by first intention. Pain was alleviated or eliminated within 48 hours after operation; no spinal nerves injury or pulmonary embolism occurred. One patient had cement leakage to the adjacent disc, who did not manifest any clinical symptoms. Thirteen patients were followed up 24 to 56 months (mean, 32 months).

OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of risk factors for new osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (VCF) after vertebroplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: New osteoporotic VCF is one of the serious complications of vertebroplasty, and it is important to investigate the risk factors for such VCFs. The risk factors for new VCFs reported so far remain controversial because of limited data and lack of uniform measurements and evaluation. METHODS: We searched the electronic database of PubMed for case-control studies about the risk of new osteoporotic VCFs after vertebroplasty. RESULTS: A total of 116 studies were identified, of which 16 studies including 559 cases and 1736 controls met the inclusion criteria. The significant risk factors for new VCFs were low bone mineral density [BMD; standardized mean difference (SMD), -0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.26 to -0.20], low body mass index (BMI; SMD, -0.30; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.10), and intradiscal cement leakage [odds ratio (OR), 2.13; 95% CI, 1.40-2.36]. The significant risk factors for new VCFs adjacent to the treated VCF were low BMD (SMD, -0.43; 95% CI, -0.76 to -0.09), low BMI (SMD, -0.52; 95% CI, -0.81 to -0.22), and intradiscal cement leakage (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.63-4.17). Low BMD, low BMI, intradiscal cement leakage, cement volume, surgical approach, age, sex, and thoracolumbar junction fracture were all not significant risk factors for new VCFs away from the original VCF. Only one study reported dynamic characteristics as risk factors for new VCFs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis strongly suggested that patients with low BMD, low BMI, and intradiscal cement leakage were at high risk for new VCFs after vertebroplasty, and risk-reduction options should be considered for such patients.",eng,0.0

METHODS: From April 2003 to November 2007, 116 patients with OVCF were treated with PKP, including 57 males and 59 females aged 65-92 years old (average 67.7 years old). All the patients suffered from trauma and the course of disease was 1-14 days (average 5.7 days). There were 159 compressed and fractured vertebral bodies, including one vertebral body in 83 cases, two vertebral bodies in 24 cases, three vertebral bodies in 8 cases, and four vertebral bodies in 1 case. The diagnosis of OVCF was confirmed by imaging examination before operation. All the patients had intact posterior vertebral walls, without symptoms of spinal and nerve root injury. During operation, 3.5-7.1 mL bone cement (average 4.8 mL) was injected into single vertebral body. RESULTS: The operation time was 30-90 minutes (average 48 minutes). Obvious pain relief was achieved in all the patients after operation. X-rays examination 2 days after operation revealed that the injured vertebral bodies were well replaced without further compression and deformation, and the bone cement was evenly distributed. Fourteen vertebral bodies had bone cement leakage (4 of anterior leakage, 4 of lateral leakage, 3 of posterior leakage, 2 of intervertebral leakage, 1 of spinal canal leakage). The reason for the bone cement leakage included the individuality of patient, the standardization of manipulation and the time of injecting bone cement. During the follow-up period of 12-30 months (average 24 months), all the patients got their normal life back, without pain, operation-induced spinal canal stenosis, obvious height loss of injured vertebral bodies and other complications. CONCLUSION: For OVCF, PKP is a mini-invasive, effective and safe procedure that provides pain relief and stabilization of spinal stability. The occurrence of bone cement leakages can be reduced by choosing the suitable case, improving the viscosity of bone cement, injecting the proper amount of bone cement and precise location during operation.",chi,0.0

To perform percutaneous vertebral body cement augmentation, it is essential to accurately identify the affected vertebrae. The study evaluated the role of radionuclide bone imaging in identifying fresh osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. A prospective study of 39 patients with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures was carried out. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radionuclide bone imaging to determine if the fractures were fresh, followed by percutaneous kyphoplasty for the fresh fractures. The positive rate on radionuclide bone imaging was 92.1% (82/89), and the positive rate on MRI was 93.3% (83/89), with no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). Eighty-one vertebrae had the same positive identification by both radionuclide bone imaging and MRI, and 5 of the same vertebrae were diagnosed negative by both techniques. One patient with positive radionuclide bone imaging was negative according to MRI, and 2 patients were entirely positive by MRI but negative by radionuclide bone imaging. A kappa test showed good consistency between the 2 methods for detecting the affected vertebrae (Kappa = 0.751, P < 0.01). Radionuclide bone imaging is as sensitive as MRI in the diagnosis of fresh osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, making it an effective method for detecting affected vertebrae for percutaneous vertebroplasty.",eng,0.0

Currently, various treatments are performed with the goal of reducing pain, stabilizing the vertebrate, and restoring mobility. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of vertebroplasty (VP), kyphoplasty (KP), and conservative treatment (CT) for the treatment of OVCFs. METHODS: We performed a network meta-analysis. PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that contained at least one of the following outcomes: visual analog scale (VAS), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), and new fractures. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to calculate the risk of new fractures, and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs were utilized to express RDQ, EQ-5D, and VAS outcomes. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs with 2046 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with CT, patients treated with VP had improved pain relief, daily function, and quality of life; however, no significant differences were found between VP and KP for these 3 outcomes. All treatment options were associated with comparable risk of new fractures. When the rank probability was assessed to distinguish subtle differences between the treatments, VP was the most effective treatment for pain relief, followed by KP and CT; conversely, KP was the most effective in improving daily function and quality of life and decreasing the incidence of new fractures, followed by VP and CT. CONCLUSION: VP might be the best option when pain relief is the principle aim of therapy, but KP was associated with the lowest risk of new fractures and might offer better outcomes in terms of daily function and quality of life.",eng,0.0

OBJECTIVE: To present a case of dynamic detection of a large pulmonary cement embolus as it formed and migrated during percutaneous vertebroplasty, which was successfully managed by percutaneous endovascular retrieval. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pulmonary embolism resulting from cement leakage after percutaneous vertebroplasty to treat osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture has been described rarely; however, the frequency of this complication may increase secondary to the expanding use of percutaneous vertebral augmentation techniques. METHODS: The formation of a large embolus of acrylic cement and its migration into the pulmonary artery was observed in real time in a 55-year-old female with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture of L4 during percutaneous vertebroplasty. RESULTS: Pulmonary arteriography confirmed the presence of the cement embolism in the right pulmonary artery during the operation. Percutaneous endovascular retrieval of the cement fragments was performed successfully via an interventional catheter procedure and subsequent incision of the femoral vein. The patient made an uneventful recovery. CONCLUSION: As illustrated by our case, large cement emboli may be primarily associated with technical aspects of the surgery. When considering the appropriate treatment strategy, percutaneous endovascular retrieval may be considered first. However, risks and benefits should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Demographic data such as age, body mass index, fracture age, hospital stay, lumbar spine bone mineral density, and amount of bone cement injected per vertebrae were recorded. Patients were analyzed clinically by ambulatory status and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Lateral radiographs were used to measure changes in anterior vertebral height. Mean anterior vertebral height increased from 58.9%+/-12.50% pre-kyphoplasty to 79.8%+/-7.12% post-kyphoplasty (P<.001).Two groups were defined based on the percentage of height restoration achieved: group A (18 patients) with a height restoration of at least 20%, and group B (27 patients) with a height restoration of 0% to 19.99% post-kyphoplasty.

OBJECTIVES: To compare Vessel-X, a novel percutaneous bone void filling container system, with conventional kyphoplasty in restoring strength, stiffness, and height in experimentally induced vertebral compressive fractures and morphologically determine the cement distribution. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Clinically, both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty perform well in reinforcement and pain relief. One of the shortcomings, however, is the risk of cement leakage. Vessel-X is a novel bone expander and bone void filler combined instrumentation for vertebral augmentation requiring evaluation. METHODS: A total of 28 fresh-frozen vertebral specimens were randomly assigned to 4 groups for testing: unipedicular kyphoplasty, bipedicular kyphoplasty, unipedicular Vessel-X, and bipedicular Vessel-X. Compressive fractures were experimentally created on each vertebra after determining the bone mineral density. Kyphoplasty and Vessel-X were performed using bioactive bone cement (SrHAC) under C-arm fluoroscopy and compared by compression testing to measure the effects of augmentation. Morphologic observations were also performed to determine the cement distribution and vertebral height restoration. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in bone mineral density, initial strength, and stiffness in any of the groups. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in total cement volume in intragroup comparison within the unipedicular or bipedicular groups. Vessel-X bone filler container could expand well and contain most of the cement. The height restoration ranged from 88.5% to 96.4% in all groups. The augmented strength with unipedicular and bipedicular injections reached 3651.57 N and 4833.73 N, respectively. Stiffness with bipedicular injection was significantly higher than that of unipedicular injection. CONCLUSION: Vessel-X was comparable to kyphoplasty in restoring the mechanical properties and height of the fractured vertebrae. Interestingly, Vessel-X instrumentation showed considerably less cement leakage and better cement placement in the vertebral body. Therefore, it could be a leakage controllable technique in percutaneous vertebral augmentation.",eng,1.0

The material without contrast with the liquid/powder ratios 8:9, 8:8, and 8:7 was classifieds as groups I, II, and III; and the EH composite material with the liquid/powder ratios 8:9, 8:8, and 8:7 and with the addition of 20% barium sulfate by weight was classified as the groups IV, V, and VI. The curing temperature was measured. The bone cement of different groups was made into cylinders to be X-rayed to observe the opacity. Universal tester was used to examine the strength and stiffness. (2) The vertebrae (T8 approximately L5) were isolated from the cadaver of an elder female patient with osteoporosis. Universal tester was used to examine the strength and stiffness of the vertebral bodies (VBs). Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) model was made. PVP procedure was mimicked by puncturing through the bilateral pedicle of vertebral arch into the anterior 1/3 of the vertebral bodies and the EH composite materials of the groups II and V were injected into the VBs Then the temperatures of the geometric center (CT) and spinal canal posterior wall (PT) of the VBs were measured in a water bath with the temperature of 37 degrees C. Twenty-four hours later the vertebrae underwent X-ray examination to observe the opacity and underwent examination of strength and stiffness with universal tester. RESULTS: (1) The sticking periods (?) of the groups IV, V, and VI were significantly longer than those of the corresponding groups I, II, and III respectively by about 60 s, and the highest temperature of the groups IV, V, and VI were significantly lower than those of the corresponding groups I, II, and III respectively. Addition1 of barium sulfate increased the opacity of the bone cement, but did nor significantly influence the strength of the bone cement. The properties of the group V was the best. (2) The bone cement was easy to be injected into the VBs. The peak PT was not beyond 50 degrees C. After the injection of the bone cement of the groups II, the strength and stiffness of the VB were (1501.6 +/- 5.0) N/mm and (285.6 +/-) N/mm, both significantly higher than those before the injection [(547.5 +/- 3.1) N/mm and (104.1 +/- 1.3) N/mm]; and after the injection of the bone cement of the groups V, the strength and stiffness of the VB were (1355.0 +/- 4.5) N/mm and (257.7 +/- 1.9), both significantly higher than those before the injection [(543.8 +/- 2.7) N/mm and (103.4 +/- 1.1) N/mm].

The operation time, bleeding volume, cement injected volume were recorded during operation. The patients' pain relief and functional activities recovery were evaluated after operation. The distribution of the cement and the restoration of vertebral height were also observed post-operation. All these patients were followed-up by telephone or clinic consults after discharged. RESULTS: All cases were successfully experienced procedures. There are no significant differences in operative time, bleeding volume and cost of every vertebrae in these two group (P > 0.05). The balloon group had larger cement injected volume per pedicle than Sky group (4.27 +/- 1.08) ml vs. (3.15 +/- 0.78) ml (P < 0.05). The VAS and ODI scoring of these two groups were both decreased significantly after operation. The vertebral height were restored in both two groups with anterior height and midline height restored significantly in balloon group and midline height restored significantly in Sky group.

However, new VCFs occur frequently after PVP. OBJECTIVES: We aim to establish an objective risk score system to assess the possibility of new vertebral fractures in patients with VCFs undergoing PVP. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a retrospective study, and it was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our 2 institutions. SETTING: This study consists of patients from 2 large academic centers. METHODS: Patients with VCFs who underwent their first PVP and met the inclusion criteria between January 2007 and December 2013 at Hospital A (training cohort) and Hospital B (validation cohort) were included. In the training cohort, the independent risk factors for new VCFs after PVP were identified by multivariate stepwise backward Cox regression analysis from the risk factors selected by univariate analysis and Harrell's C-statistics and used to develop the score system (assessment for new VCFs after PVP [ANVCFV]) to predict the probability of new VCFs. RESULTS: In total, 397 patients (training cohort: n = 241; validation cohort: n = 156) were included in this study. In the training cohort, the ANVCFV score was developed based on 5 independent risk factors for the new VCFs after PVP, including lower computed tomography (CT) values, pre-existing old VCFs, intradiscal cement leakage, more than one vertebra treated, and superior or inferior marginal cement distribution in the vertebra.

A total of 15 vertebral peripheral wall damage-type OVCF models of new calves (12-14 weeks) were treated with a decalcifying agent (Shandon TBD-1) with the vertebral compression fracture. The vertebral volume and anterior height before modeling, and the vertebral BMD before and after modeling were measured. The models were randomly divided into three groups: the improved PVP group (Group A), the traditional PKP group (Group B) and the control group (Group C). BMD of Groups A, B and C after decalcification was significantly lower than that before decalcification (P<0.05). There were no significant differences in BMD before and after decalcification among Groups A, B and C (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the initial strength and stiffness among the three groups (P>0.05).

Yang,2017.0,Surgical treatment of secondary fractures after percutaneous vertebroplasty: A retrospective study,10.4103/0019-5413.205677,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) are effective procedures for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). However, recent studies have reported that secondary VCFs develop in patients after PVP or PKP treatment. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and management of secondary fractures after PVP or PKP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 599 cases who had vertebral compression fracture and underwent PVP or PKP between September 2008 and June 2014 were enrolled, including 121 males and 478 females. Secondary fractures were observed in 52 cases, including 3 males and 49 females, who were treated by re-operation with PVP or PKP. RESULTS: The ratio of secondary fracture after PVP or PKP was 8.68% in all cases. The age ranged from 59 to 92 years (74.41 +/- 6.83 average). A composition of 44.44% of the secondary fracture occurred near the initial fracture vertebrae. After re-operation with PVP or PKP, visual analog scale score significantly decreased to 2.72 +/- 0.88 or 2.52 +/- 1.12, respectively, anterior height of vertebral bodies increased to 24.69 +/- 4.59 or 24.54 +/- 5.97 mm, respectively, and middle height of vertebral bodies increased to 20.90 +/- 3.72 or 20.36 +/- 6.33 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high chance of secondary fracture near the initially operated vertebrae after PVP or PKP. Re-operation with PVP or PKP achieves satisfactory outcomes in these patients such as pain relief and the recovery of the vertebrae height.",eng,1.0

Chen,2016.0,Risk factors for bone cement leakage in percutaneous vertebroplasty: a retrospective study of four hundred and eighty five patients,10.1007/s00264-015-3102-2,"PURPOSE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a common procedure in spine surgery. Bone cement leakage is the most common complication related to this procedure. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and risk factors for cement leakage after PVP. METHODS: A total of 485 patients who underwent PVP between August 2003 and August 2013 were enrolled in the study. Clinical and radiological characteristics, including age, gender, diagnosis, operated level, surgical approach, type of anesthesia, volume of bone cement, fracture type, and fracture severity, were considered as potential risk factors. Cement leakage was assessed based on post-operative imaging examination. Six types of leakage were defined and risk factors for each type were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of leakage was 58.2 %. Binary logistic analysis revealed that larger volume of bone cement (P < 0.001) and higher fracture severity grade (P < 0.001) were the strongest independent risk factors. Univariate analysis and multinomial logistic analysis showed that surgical approach (P < 0.001), gender (P = 0.016), and operated level (P = 0.032) were additional risk factors for leakage. Further analysis showed that more bone cement was used in bilateral than unilateral approaches, that men had larger volumes of bone cement injected than women, and that more bone cement was injected into lumbar vertebrae than thoracic vertebrae. Therefore, these risk factors (surgical approach, gender, and operated level) could be attributed to excess bone cement usage. CONCLUSIONS: Cement leakage is very common with PVP. Higher fracture severity grade and larger volume of bone cement were the two strongest independent risk factors for leakage.",eng,1.0

In this study, we developed a sheep vertebral bone defect model to evaluate the new bioactive materials and assessed the feasibility of the model in vivo. Bone voids were experimentally created on lumbar vertebrae L2-L5 with L1 and L6 left intact as a normal control in mature sheep. The defect vertebrae L2-L5 in each sheep were randomized to receive augmentation with calcium phosphate cement (CPC) or sham. Vertebrae (L1-L6) were collected after 2 and 24 weeks of the cement augmentation and their strength and stiffness, as well as osseointegration activity and biodegradability, were evaluated. Finally, CPC significantly improved the strength and stiffness of vertebrae but did not yet restore it to the normal level at 24 weeks. Osteogenesis occurred at a substantially high level after 24 weeks of CPC augmentation or sham. Therefore, the sheep vertebral model with one void, 6.0 mm in diameter and 15.0 mm in depth, is replicable and can be used for evaluating the new injectable bioactive materials in vertebral augmentation or reconstruction.",eng,1.0

De Deyne,2002.0,Percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic compression fractures: quantitative prospective evaluation of long-term outcomes,", ","PURPOSE: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures may cause debilitating pain that lasts for weeks or months, and which is often neither quickly nor completely relieved by conventional conservative therapy. Previous retrospective studies have suggested significant and nearly immediate pain relief, as well as rapid and sustained functional recovery, after percutaneous polymethylmethacrylate vertebroplasty (PPV). This prospective, quantitative study with long-term follow-up was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PPV as a new treatment for patients with osteoporotic vertebral body compression fractures of the lumbar and thoracic spine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PPV was performed in 30 patients with 54 symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures who had a less-than-satisfactory response to conventional therapy. All procedures were performed by a single operator with significant experience in performing PPV. The Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management Scale (MODEMS) spinal intervention questionnaire, which includes the SF-36, was administered to all patients before intervention and exactly 2 weeks after the final PPV procedure. Pain and disability, treatment expectations and satisfaction, mental function, and quality of life were evaluated by four specialized modules, and responses to questionnaires preceding treatment were compared to those obtained at follow-up. Results of a long-term follow-up questionnaire were collected 15-18 months after the final vertebroplasty treatment. RESULTS: Our population consisted of three men and 27 women, with a mean age of 79 years. Fifty-four PPV procedures were performed for compression fractures in these 30 patients. Significant postprocedural improvement in all four MODEMS modules was demonstrated at 2 weeks (treatment score, P <.0001; pain and disability, P <.0001; physical function, P =.0004; and mental function, P =.0009). A small epidural leak of polymethylmethacrylate in one patient was asymptomatic and did not require intervention. At long-term follow-up (15-18 mo), 22 of 23 patients responding remained satisfied with the outcome of therapy and believed that the procedure had provided durable pain relief. Verbal pain scores documented significantly diminished back pain at 2 weeks (P <.0001) and again at long-term follow-up when compared to baseline (P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: PPV is a safe and efficacious procedure for the relief of pain and disability after osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Patient satisfaction is high and persists when compared to preprocedural expectations; durable pain relief is provided.",eng,0.0

Journal Article,J. Zou; X. Mei; M. Gan; G. Wang; J. Lu; H. Yang,2010.0,Is kyphoplasty reliable for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with vertebral wall deficiency?,10.1016/j.injury.2009.09.033,"BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures are a common clinical manifestation of osteoporosis. The introduction of kyphoplasty has allowed minimally invasive treatment of these fractures. However, in patients with loss of vertebral wall integrity, balloon kyphoplasty is contraindicated due to the possibility of extruding wall fragments into the canal and cement extravasation. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of kyphoplasty in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in patients with compromised vertebral walls using individualised surgical techniques to avoid cement extravasation. METHODS: Symptomatic vertebral fractures (59 fractures in 55 patients) were treated by kyphoplasty. In levels with compromised anterior vertebral walls, two distinct sequential applications of cement were performed to avoid anterior leakage. In levels that demonstrated posterior or lateral wall deficiencies, the cement was injected under live fluoroscopy to monitor lateral or posterior extravasation. Radiographic outcomes were evaluated by comparing pre- and postoperative anterior/middle vertebral body height and local kyphotic angle. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by comparing Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) values preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Symptomatic cement extravasation and complications after kyphoplasty were not observed. Vertebral height was restored and the mean kyphotic angle was improved. The mean VAS decreased significantly from pre-surgery to post-surgery, as did the ODI (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty is a safe, clinically effective treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fracture with peripheral wall damage when using individualised surgical techniques to prevent bone cement leakage.",eng,0.0

Yang,2010.0,Kyphoplasty for spinal fractures from multiple myeloma,10.1002/jso.21574,"INTRODUCTION: Vertebral destruction secondary to multiple myeloma is a significant clinical issue, and controversy still exists over how many levels should undergo kyphoplasty in multiple myeloma. In addition, in vertebrae that have lost wall integrity, cement extravasation remains an important consideration and is relatively contraindicated. METHODS: Forty-three symptomatic vertebral fractures from multiple myeloma were diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In levels with anterior vertebral wall compromise, two distinct sequential applications of cement were performed. In levels with demonstrated posterior or lateral wall deficiency, cement was injected under fluoroscopy. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the procedure well and had immediate relief of back pain after kyphoplasty. Symptomatic cement extravasation and other complications were not observed. Vertebral height was restored (anterior 56.9 +/- 14.2% to 82.9 +/- 11.2%, middle 71.0 +/- 13.4% to 81.1 +/- 6.4%) (P < 0.001), and the mean kyphotic angle was improved (17.1 +/- 7.2 degrees to 8.9 +/- 6.4 degrees ) (P < 0.001). The mean VAS decreased significantly from presurgery to postsurgery (8.1 +/- 1.5 to 3.6 +/- 1.8) (P < 0.001), as did the ODI (63.2 +/- 15.9 to 37.1 +/- 10.2) (P < 0.001). Six of eight subscores measured by the SF-36, were significantly improved by the operation. All improvements were sustained up to final follow-up. CONCLUSION: Kyphoplasty is a safe and clinically effective treatment for pathologic vertebral fractures from multiple myeloma, even in levels with vertebral wall deficiency. The strategy of determining systematic level by alterations in MRI signal is effective in lowering the cost.",eng,0.0
Journal Article,J. Zou; X. Mei; X. Zhu; Q. Shi; H. Yang,2012.0,The long-term incidence of subsequent vertebral body fracture after vertebral augmentation therapy: a systemic review and meta-analysis,", ","BACKGROUND: Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have recently been used to treat painful osteoporotic compression fractures. Early clinical results have been encouraging, but very little is known about the consequences of augmentation with cement for adjacent, unaugmented levels. OBJECTIVE: This study performed a systemic review of the studies concerning whether the incidence of subsequent vertebral body fracture after vertebral augmentation therapy would be increased long-term. STUDY DESIGN: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed comparing the long-term incidence of subsequent vertebral body fracture between vertebral augmentation surgeries like vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty and conventional nonsurgical management. SETTING: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases and abstracts published in annual proceedings were systematically searched for evidence. METHODS: Relevant reports were reviewed by 2 reviewers independently and the references from these reports were searched for additional trials, using guidelines set by QUOROM statement criteria. RESULTS: Pooled results from 2 randomized controlled trials showed no significant increase of the secondary fracture rate after vertebral augmentation therapy compared with that of conventional treatment (P = 0.07). Few large-sample randomized controlled trials were specifically performed to investigate new fractures as an outcome of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. LIMITATIONS: There were few data sources from which to extract abstracted data or published studies. There were only 2 randomized controlled trials that met criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Although vertebral augmentation therapies, such as vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, have been widely used in clinics to treat patients' back pain caused by vertebral compression fractures due to osteoporosis, no evidence shows that they can increase the fracture of adjacent vertebral bodies.",eng,0.0

Deng,2015.0,Spinal tuberculosis of the lumbar spine after percutaneous vertebral augmentation (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty),10.1016/j.spinee.2015.02.032,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Spinal tuberculosis occurring after percutaneous vertebral augmentation has rarely been described. To date, only two such cases have been documented in the literature. Vertebral augmentation may reactivate a quiescent tuberculous lesion and promote the infective process in elderly patients with or without immunosuppression, thereby resulting in poor outcomes. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to present two cases in which spinal tuberculosis occurred after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, to highlight the clinical features and need for early diagnosis of this pathology, and to postulate probable reasons for this association. STUDY DESIGN: This study is based on a clinical case series and literature review. METHODS: In this report, we review the clinical histories of two old women undergoing vertebral augmentation with subsequent spinal tuberculosis. RESULTS: The first patient responded favorably to conservative treatment with multidrug antitubercular therapy and spinal braces. The second patient underwent surgical debridement through a posterior approach alone, without instrumentation, combined with adjuvant chemotherapy. By 1 year after treatment, both patients had experienced almost complete recovery and continued to be seen for follow-up visits. CONCLUSIONS: Suspicion should be high, and magnetic resonance imaging is warranted in cases with deteriorating clinical symptoms and signs of acute infection after vertebral augmentation. We propose obtaining exhaustive microbiologic and histologic evidence via needle biopsy or open surgery in a timely fashion to establish an accurate diagnosis because tubercular spondylitis occurring in such a situation may progress rapidly.",eng,1.0
