Searching for studies on the efficacy and safety of Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR), in patients with non-invasive sessile or flat superficial colorectal lesions at least 25mm (milimetres, milimeters) in diameter. Applied for removal of colorectal lesions unsuitable for resection using standard endoscopic polypectomy. Comparator studies could include removal of colorectal lesions by surgical resection. Efficacy outcomes may include Technical success rate (defined as "absence of neoplastic tissue at completion of the procedure after careful inspection of the post-EMR mucosal defect and margin."), Uptake of surgical resection in unsuccessful EMR cases (EMR only), Lesion recurrence rate (short-term and long-term recurrence), the rate of long-term colorectal cancer development, time to perform procedure, and the length of hospital stay. Safety outcomes may include, Intraprocedural complications, postprocedural complications, bleeding-related adverse events (including delayed polypectomy bleeding), deep mural injury rate (EMR only), perforation rate (EMR only), hospital presentations/admissions reported following procedure, procedure-related mortality rate.
