White,1995.0,Post-herniorrhaphy pain in outpatients after pre-incision ilioinguinal-hypogastric nerve block during monitored anaesthesia care,10.1007/bf03010564,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an ilioinguinal-hypogastric nerve block (IHNB) with bupivacaine 0.25% on the postoperative analgesic requirement and recovery profile in outpatients undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy with local anaesthetic infiltration. Thirty consenting healthy men undergoing elective unilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy procedures were randomly assigned to receive an IHNB with either saline or bupivacaine according to a double-blind, IRB-approved protocol. All patients received midazolam, 2 mg iv, and fentanyl 25 microgram iv, prior to injection of 30 ml of either bupivacaine 0.25% or saline through the oblique muscle approximately 1.5 cm medial to the anterior superior iliac spine. Subsequently, the surgeon infiltrated the incision site with a lidocaine 1% solution. Sedation was maintained during the operation with a variable-rate propofol infusion, 25-140 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. No significant differences were noted in the intraoperative doses of lidocaine, propofol and fentanyl in the two treatment groups. However, the pain visual analogue score at 30 min after entering the PACU was lower in the bupivacaine (versus saline) group (P < 0.05). Although the times to ambulation (86 +/- 18 vs 99 +/- 27 min) and being judged fit for discharge"" (112 +/- 49 vs 126 +/- 30 min) were similar in the two groups, the bupivacaine-treated (vs saline) patients required less oral analgesic medication after discharge (46% vs 85%). We concluded that the use of an ilioinguinal-hypogastric nerve block with bupivacaine 0.25% as an adjuvant during inguinal herniorrhaphy under monitored anaesthesia care decreased pain in the PACU and oral analgesic requirements after discharge from the day-surgery unit.""",eng,1

Slade,2012.0,The surgical rectus sheath block for post-operative analgesia: a modern approach to an established technique,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2011.10.015,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the surgical rectus sheath block for post-operative pain relief following major gynaecological surgery. TECHNIQUE: Local anaesthetic (20 ml 0.25% bupivacaine bilaterally) is administered under direct vision to the rectus sheath space at the time of closure of the anterior abdominal wall. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective case note review of 98 consecutive patients undergoing major gynaecological surgery for benign or malignant disease who received either standard subcutaneous infiltration of the wound with local anaesthetic (LA, n=51) or the surgical rectus sheath block (n=47) for post-operative pain relief. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Pain scores on waking, (2) duration of morphine-based patient controlled analgesia (PCA), (3) quantity of morphine used during the first 48 post-operative hours and (4) length of post-operative stay. RESULTS: The groups were similar in age, the range of procedures performed and the type of pathology observed. Patients who received the surgical rectus sheath block had lower pain scores on waking [0 (0-1) vs. 2 (1-3), p<0.001], required less morphine post-operatively [12 mg (9-26) vs. 36 mg (30-48), p<0.001], had their PCAs discontinued earlier [24h (18-34) vs. 37 h (28-48), p<0.001] and went home earlier [4 days (3-4) vs. 5 days post-op (4-8), p<0.001] [median (interquartile range)] than patients receiving standard subcutaneous local anaesthetic into the wound. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical rectus sheath block appears to provide effective post-operative analgesia for patients undergoing major gynaecological surgery. A randomised controlled clinical trial is required to assess its efficacy further.",eng,0

Fearon,2014.0,Evaluation of novel local anesthetic wound infiltration techniques for postoperative pain following colorectal resection surgery: a meta-analysis,10.1097/dcr.0000000000000006,"BACKGROUND: Novel local anesthetic blocks have become increasingly popular in the multimodal pain management following abdominal surgery, but have not been evaluated in a procedure-specific manner in colorectal surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of novel local anesthetic techniques in colorectal surgery. DATA SOURCES: Electronic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases (date range, January 1990 to February 2013) STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials comparing a novel local anesthetic technique with placebo/routine analgesia in adults undergoing open or laparoscopic colonic or rectal resection were selected. INTERVENTIONS: This is a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating novel local anesthetic wound infiltration techniques such as wound catheter, transversus abdominis plane block, and intraperitoneal instillation in colorectal surgical procedures. The comparator group was defined as placebo/routine analgesia. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was opiate requirement at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included opiate requirements at 48 hours, pain numerical rating score at 24 and 48 hours at rest and on movement, recovery (length of stay, nausea and vomiting, time until bowel movement and diet resumption), and complications. Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate specific local anesthetic techniques and open and laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS: Twelve randomized controlled trials compared local anesthetic techniques with placebo/routine analgesia. Local anesthetic techniques demonstrated a significant reduction in opiate requirement at 48 hours. Local anesthetic techniques were also associated with lower pain scores on movement at 24 and 48 hours, shorter length of stay, and earlier resumption of diet. LIMITATIONS: The diverse study design led to statistical heterogeneity in several analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Novel local anesthetic wound infiltration techniques in colorectal surgery appear to reduce opiate requirements, to reduce pain scores, and to improve recovery in comparison with placebo/routine analgesia.",eng,1

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of II-IH nerve block on postoperative pain and analgesic consumption in patients when performed after CS. METHODS: Sixty ASA I- II patients, scheduled for elective CS were included in the study. After general anaesthesia, patients were allocated into 2 groups randomly. In group I bilateral II-IH block has been performed after the skin closure, with 10 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine on each side. In group II sham block had been performed. For postoperative analgesia all patients received tramadol via i.v patient controlled analgesia. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scored tramadol consumption and side effects. RESULTS: The mean VAS scores in II-IH block group were significantly lower than in sham block group at 6(th), 8(th), 12(th), 24(th) hours at rest (p < 0.05) and at 6(th), 8(th) hours with movement (p < 0.05). Tramadol usage in II-IH block group was significantly less than in sham block group at all estimated time intervals (p < 0.05). Total tramadol consumption was 331 +/- 82 mg in II-IH block group and 622 +/- 107 mg in sham block group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that II-IH nerve block when performed after the surgery may reduce analgesic consumption after CS.",eng,1

METHODS: Between January 2004 and February 2005, we randomly assigned 120 consecutive patients undergoing mini-thoracotomy (10-13 cm) for major lung resections, to receive or not IINB from the 4th to the 8th space at the moment of thoracotomy using 20 ml (7.5 mg/ml) ropivacain injection at the dose of 4 ml for each space. Postoperative analgesia consisted of continuous intravenous infusion of tramadol (10 mg/h) and ketoralac tromethamine (3 mg/h) for 48 h for all patients. RESULTS: The two groups (60 patients each) were comparable for age, sex, pulmonary function, type and duration of the procedure. Mortality and morbidity were 0% and 10%, respectively, for the IINB group and 3.3% and 15%, respectively, for the non-IINB group (p>0.05, NS). Mean postoperative pain measured by the 'Visual Analogue Scale' were as follows: 2.3+/-1 at 1 h, 2.2+/-0.8 at 12 h, 1.8+/-0.7 at 24 h, and 1.6+/-0.6 at 48 h for the IINB group; and 3.6+/-1.4 at 1 h, 3.4+/-2 at 12 h, 2.9+/-1.2 at 24 h, and 2.0+/-1 at 48 h for the non-IINB group. Differences were significant at 1 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h (p<0.05). Mean postoperative hospital stay was 5.7 days in the IINB group and 6.5 days in the non-IINB group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: IINB associated with mini-thoracotomy reduces postoperative pain and contributes to improve postoperative outcome after major pulmonary resections.",eng,1

Wesen,2012.0,"Paravertebral blocks in breast cancer surgery: is there a difference in postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting?",10.1245/s10434-011-1899-5,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients with paravertebral blocks (PVB) undergoing breast cancer surgery with or without axillary staging. METHODS: An Institutional Review Board approved, retrospective chart review from January 2007 to December 2009 was performed at a single institution. Charts were reviewed for type of breast cancer surgery, axillary staging, PVB, PONV, postoperative pain score, dosages of pain medication and antiemetic medication given in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), and during the postoperative days (POD). The study population consisted of females with a diagnosis of breast cancer undergoing breast cancer surgery, with or without axillary staging. Patients were excluded if they: had simultaneous myocutaneous tissue flap breast reconstruction, had additional surgical procedures, used continuous delivery postoperative pain medications, had a history of chronic pain, or had a history of chronic antiemetics prior to surgery. All patients received standard perioperative medications per the anesthesia department. RESULTS: A total of 419 patients underwent breast cancer surgery during the given time period of which 337 patients were able to be included in the study. Of these patients, 241 of the 337 patients had PVB and 96 patients did not have PVB. The mean age was 59.5 years. The mean BMI was 28.7 kg/m(2). Also, 45.5% of the patients who had PVB (110) had a mastectomy, while 41.1% of patients in the non-PVB cohort (39) had a mastectomy. In addition, 45 patients with PVB had immediate tissue expander reconstruction and only 14 patients in the non-PVB group. Of patients with PVB, 53.3% (129) had a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) and 33.5% (81) had full axillary dissections. Of patients in the non-PVB, 35.8% (34) had no axillary staging and 44.2% (42) underwent SLN. Also, 229 patients with PVB and 78 patients without PVB had a general anesthetic. Only 3.3% of patients with PVB and 4.2% of patients without PVB had postoperative nausea (P = 0.746). One patient with PVB and no patients without PVB reported emesis in the PACU (P = 1). There was no difference in morphine equivalents (P = 0.234) or in pain scores (P = 0.521) between the 2 groups in the PACU. There was no difference in amount of morphine equivalents given on POD0 (P = 0.8) or POD1 (P = 0.079). The reconstruction patients with PVB used less opioid analgesic on POD1 compared with the non-PVB reconstruction group (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing breast cancer surgery who have paravertebral blocks have similar postoperative nausea and vomiting and similar postoperative pain scores compared with patients without paravertebral blocks. PVB may have an important role in decreasing postoperative pain and opioid analgesic usage in patients electing to have immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expanders.",eng,0

Saravanappa,2008.0,Local anaesthetic for post-tonsillectomy pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1111/j.1749-4486.2008.01815.x,"BACKGROUND: Tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed procedures in otolaryngology. Pain is a significant aspect of post-operative patient morbidity. The use of local anaesthetic, by infiltration or topical application, has been advocated as a way of reducing post-operative pain. OBJECTIVES: To review the current evidence for the use of local anaesthetic as a means of reducing post-tonsillectomy pain and reducing supplemental analgesic requirements. TYPE OF REVIEW: A systematic review of the literature pertaining to the use of local anaesthetic agents for post-tonsillectomy pain and meta-analysis of randomised control trials assessing pain scores. SEARCH STRATEGY: Systematic literature searches of MEDLINE (1952-2008), EMBASE (1974-2008) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. EVALUATION METHOD: Review of all randomised controlled trials by two authors and grading of articles for quality. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. Overall, local anaesthetic, applied topically or infiltrated, significantly reduces pain scores compared with controls at 4-6 h, -0.66 (95% CI: -0.82, -0.50); 20-24 h, -0.34 (95% CI: -0.51, -0.18) and on day 5, -0.97 (95% CI: -1.30, -0.63) (standardised mean differences). These changes approximate to a reduction in pain of between 7 and 19 mm on a 0-100 mm visual analogue scale. Most studies did not report a difference in supplemental analgesia or in adverse events. CONCLUSION: Local anaesthetic does seem to provide a modest reduction in post-tonsillectomy pain. Topical local anaesthetic on swabs appears to provide a similar level of analgesia to that of infiltration without the potential adverse effects and should be the method of choice for providing additional post-operative analgesia.",eng,0

Sessler,2006.0,Can anesthetic technique for primary breast cancer surgery affect recurrence or metastasis?,", http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1615712/pdf/nihms-11585.pdf","BACKGROUND: Regional anesthesia is known to prevent or attenuate the surgical stress response; therefore, inhibiting surgical stress by paravertebral anesthesia might attenuate perioperative factors that enhance tumor growth and spread. The authors hypothesized that breast cancer patients undergoing surgery with paravertebral anesthesia and analgesia combined with general anesthesia have a lower incidence of cancer recurrence or metastases than patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia and patient-controlled morphine analgesia. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the authors examined the medical records of 129 consecutive patients undergoing mastectomy and axillary clearance for breast cancer between September 2001 and December 2002. RESULTS: Fifty patients had surgery with paravertebral anesthesia and analgesia combined with general anesthesia, and 79 patients had general anesthesia combined with postoperative morphine analgesia. The follow-up time was 32 +/- 5 months (mean +/- SD). There were no significant differences in patients or surgical details, tumor presentation, or prognostic factors. Recurrence- and metastasis-free survival was 94% (95% confidence interval, 87-100%) and 82% (74-91%) at 24 months and 94% (87-100%) and 77% (68-87%) at 36 months in the paravertebral and general anesthesia patients, respectively (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis suggests that paravertebral anesthesia and analgesia for breast cancer surgery reduces the risk of recurrence or metastasis during the initial years of follow-up. Prospective trials evaluating the effects of regional analgesia and morphine sparing on cancer recurrence seem warranted.",eng,0

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of systemic intraoperative lidocaine on postoperative quality of recovery when compared to saline. Methods: The study was a prospective randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomized to receive lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg bolus followed by a 2 mg/kg/h infusion until the end of the surgical procedure) or the same volume of saline. The primary outcome was the quality of recovery 40 questionnaire at 24 h after surgery. Results: Fifty-one subjects were recruited and 50 completed the study. The global QoR-40 scores at 24 h were greater in the lidocaine group median (IQR) of 165 (151 to 170) compared to the saline group, median (IQR) of 146 (130 to 169), P = 0.01. Total 24 h opioid consumption was lower in the lidocaine group, median (IQR) of 26 (19 to 46) mg IV morphine equivalents compared to the saline group, median (IQR) of 36 (24 to 65) mg IV morphine equivalents, P = 0.03. Linear regression demonstrated an inverse relationship between the total 24 h opioid consumption (IV morphine equivalents) and 24 h postoperative quality of recovery (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Systemic lidocaine improves postoperative quality of recovery in patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Patients who received lidocaine had a lower opioid consumption which translated to a better quality of recovery. 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",English,0

In this controlled study, we investigated the analgesic and sensory effects of ultrasound-guided blocks of the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves with lidocaine. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 12 patients with severe persistent inguinal postherniorrhaphy pain, including a control group of 12 healthy controls, was performed. Assessments included pain ratings under standardized conditions with numerical rating scale (0-10), sensory mapping to a cool roller, and quantitative sensory testing (QST), in the groin regions, before and after each ultrasound-guided block. A needle approach of 1 to 2 cm superior and medial to the anterior superior iliac spine was used. Outcomes were changes in pain ratings, sensory mapping, and QST compared with preblock values. Lidocaine responders were a priori defined by a pain reduction of >/=80% after lidocaine block and </=25% after placebo block, nonresponders by pain reduction of <80% after lidocaine block and </=25% after placebo block, and placebo responders by pain reduction of >25% after placebo block. RESULTS: One of 12 pain patients was a lidocaine responder, 6 patients were nonresponders, and 5 patients were placebo responders. No consistent QST changes were observed in patients after the lidocaine block. In 10 of 12 healthy controls, a cool hypoesthesia area developed in the groin after the lidocaine block. Furthermore, QST assessments demonstrated significantly decreased suprathreshold heat pain perception in the groin after lidocaine versus placebo blocks (95% confidence interval = -3.5 to -0.5, P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided lidocaine blocks of the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves, at the level of the anterior superior iliac spine, are not useful in diagnosis and management of persistent inguinal postherniorrhaphy pain.",eng,0
Journal Article,X. Capdevila; M. Ponrouch; O. Choquet,2008.0,Continuous peripheral nerve blocks in clinical practice,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACO.0b013e32830c66c2,"Purpose of review: The present review highlights new insights into indications and guidance during procedures for continuous peripheral nerve blocks. Recent findings: Continuous peripheral nerve blocks consistently provide better analgesia than traditional systemic opioid-based analgesia. The literature shows that continuous peripheral nerve blocks prolong site-specific local anesthetic delivery in the outpatient setting, allow optimal analgesia, have minimal side effects, and avoid premature regression of an analgesic block. Furthermore, an improvement in patients' health-related quality of life or outcome benefits has been demonstrated. It appears that continuous peripheral nerve blocks are generally superior to intraarticular local anesthetic infusion for immediate postoperative pain, but new data demonstrate that, apart from a multimodal analgesia regimen, periarticular and intraarticular application of local anesthetics can improve early postoperative analgesia and mobilization. Finally, it seems that, only for interscalene and popliteal sciatic nerve blocks, the use of stimulating catheters slightly decreases visual analog scale scores for postoperative pain and intravenous opioid rescue analgesia. Ultrasound guidance offers the potential advantage to confirm catheter tip location. Summary: Continuous peripheral nerve blocks are essential in the perioperative anesthetic management of in-hospital or ambulatory patients. Ultrasound guidance and stimulating catheters can help anesthetists during the procedure. 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",English,0

Attia,2010.0,In patients undergoing thoracic surgery is paravertebral block as effective as epidural analgesia for pain management?,http://dx.doi.org/10.1510/icvts.2009.221127,"A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was: in patients undergoing thoracic surgery is paravertebral block (PVB) as effective as epidural analgesia for pain management? Altogether >184 papers were found using the reported search, seven of which represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. All studies agreed that PVB is at least as effective as epidural analgesia for pain control post-thoracotomy. In one paper, the visual analogue pain score (VAS) at rest and on cough was significantly lower in the paravertebral group (P=0.02 and 0.0001, respectively). Pulmonary function, as assessed by peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), was significantly better preserved in the paravertebral group. The lowest PEFR as a fraction of preoperative control was 0.73 in the paravertebral group in contrast with 0.54 in the epidural group (P<0.004). Oximetric recordings were better in the paravertebral group (96%) compared to the epidural group (95%) (P=0.0001). Another article reported that statistically significant differences (forced vital capacity 46.8% for PVB and 39.3% for epidural group P<0.05; forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV <sub>1</sub>) 48.4% in PVB group and 35.9% in epidural group, P<0.05) were reached in day 2 and continued until day 3. Plasma concentrations of cortisol, as marker of postoperative stress, increased markedly in both groups, but the increment was statistically different in favour of the paravertebral group (P=0.003). Epidural block was associated with frequent side-effects [urinary retention (42%), nausea (22%), itching (22%) and hypotension (3%) and, rarely, respiratory depression (0.07%)]. Additionally, it prolonged operative time and was associated with technical failure or displacement (8%). Epidurals were also related to a higher complication rate (atelectasis/pneumonia) compared to the PVB (2 vs. 0). PVB was found to be of equal efficacy to epidural anaesthesia, but with a favourable side effect profile, and lower complication rate. The reduced rate of complication was most marked for pulmonary complications and is accompanied by quicker return to normal pulmonary function. We conclude intercostal analgesia, in the form of PVB, can be at least as effective as epidural analgesia. 2010 Published by European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

Injection of 3-10 mL of 0.25%-0.5% bupivacaine into each lateral pharyngeal space appeared to provide good postsurgical analgesia. A retrospective chart review failed to link the technique to airway-related complications. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing the analgesic effectiveness and postsurgical complications in patients undergoing tonsillectomy and receiving either bupivacaine or placebo was begun after institutional approval and informed consent. The study was terminated after eight children had been enrolled because two of four children receiving bupivacaine developed severe upper airway obstruction (UAO) after extubation of the trachea. We conclude that the volume and concentration of bupivacaine were sufficient to block the vagus nerves proximal to the take off of the recurrent laryngeal nerves and/or the hypoglossal nerves, resulting in severe UAO. The short distance between the hyoid and jugular foramen would predispose children and adults with a short neck to the development of this complication. In conclusion, bilateral local anesthetic injection into the lateral pharyngeal space may result in severe UAO and loss of protective reflexes.",eng,1

Hewett,2000.0,"Ischiorectal fossa block decreases posthemorrhoidectomy pain: randomized, prospective, double-blind clinical trial",", ","PURPOSE: Hemorrhoidectomy can be associated with severe pain in the immediate postoperative period. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a preemptive local anesthetic, ischiorectal fossa block, in the reduction of pain and analgesic requirements after hemorrhoidectomy. METHODS: All patients were suitable for an established day surgery hemorrhoidectomy protocol. Immediately before surgery patients were randomly assigned either to receive (Group 1) or not receive (Group 2) the local anesthetic block. All other aspects of surgery and anesthesia were standardized. Nursing staff assessed pain at 30 minutes and 2, 4, and 24 hours postoperatively using a visual analog scale (1-10, where 1 represented no pain and 10 represented the worst pain imaginable). Analgesic requirements also were recorded at these times. Both the patients and the nursing staff were blinded to which local anesthetic protocol had been used. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled in the trial. Ten patients were randomly assigned to Group I and ten to Group 2. Mean pain scores for Group 1 (anal block) at 0.5, 2, 4, and 24 hours were 1.5, 1.8, 2.1, and 2.5, respectively, compared with Group 2, with mean pain scores of 3.4, 3.4, 3.9, and 5.1. These differences were statistically significant. Patients in Group 1 used less analgesia in the first 24 hours postoperatively than those in Group 2. CONCLUSION: The use of a preemptive local anesthetic, ischiorectal fossa block, is associated with a significant decrease in pain and analgesia requirements after hemorrhoidectomy.",eng,1

The operations were cholecystectomy or choledocholithotomy through a subcostal incision, partial gastric resection, repair of a diaphragmatic hernia or vagotomy through a midline incision. Pain relief was achieved in a random order either by intercostal block (i.c.b.) and centrally acting analgesics on demand, or by centrally acting analgesics alone. The analgesic demand was recorded, and the respiratory capacity was monitored by the peak expiratory flow rate (PEF). A smaller analgesic requirement and a smaller change in PEF were found after cholecystectomy than after any other kind of surgery. The demand for analgesics was age-dependent, and patients under 60 years of age demanded more than those aged 60 years and older. Bilateral i.c.b. given after surgery through a midline incision had few advantages, but unilateral i.c.b. following cholecystectomy and choledocholithotomy with a subcostal incision had positive effects. Thus it decreased the demand for centrally acting analgesics and resulted in higher PEF values than without i.c.b. for cholecystectomy during the period of effective nerve block and for choledocholithotomy for 2 whole days postoperatively. Smokers seemed to benefit from i.c.b. for 2 postoperative days. The reduction of PEF after cholecystectomy also seemed to be related to the duration of treatment with centrally acting analgesics.",eng,0

Patients were administered a 3-ml injection during ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block; 15 patients received lidocaine 2% and 15 patients received 0.9% saline. Following the block, all patients received standardised general anaesthesia. Postoperative analgesia included regular intravenous diclofenac, paracetamol and patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol for 24 h. Patients were observed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h after surgery for tramadol consumption, cardiovascular variables and visual analogue scale pain scores at rest and on movement. The mean (SD) hourly tramadol consumption was significantly reduced in the lidocaine group compared with the saline group at 4 h (8.0 (10.1) mg vs 28.0 (12.6) mg, respectively; p = 0.001), 6 h (5.3 (10.8) mg vs 17.3 (12.7) mg, respectively; p = 0.013) and 8 h (5.3 (11.8) mg vs 21.3 (9.1) mg, respectively; p = 0.001). The cumulative 24-h tramadol consumption was 97.3 (16.6) mg in the lidocaine group and 150.6 (26.0) mg in the saline group (p = 0.001). There were significant differences in the pain visual analogue scale at rest at two time points; at 4 h the median (IQR [range]) visual analogue scale scores were 4 (4-6 [2-8]) in the lidocaine group and 5 (4-6 [2-7]) in the saline group (p = 0.03), and at 6 h visual analogue scale scores were 3 (3-4 [3-6]) and 4 (4-6 [2-7]), respectively (p = 0.04). Pain visual analogue scale on movement was lower in the lidocaine group at all time intervals compared with the saline group, but this did not reach statistical significance.

Bekci,2012.0,Comparison between intermittent intravenous analgesia and intermittent paravertebral subpleural analgesia for pain relief after thoracotomy,10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.03.056,"OBJECTIVE: In the present prospective double-blind randomized trial, the effects of intermittent paravertebral subpleural bupivacaine and morphine on pain management in patients undergoing thoracotomy were evaluated and compared with intermittent systemic analgesia. METHODS: Forty-five patients undergoing elective lobectomy were included in the present study. Three randomized groups consisting of 15 patients each were compared. Those in the control group were administered intravenously with tramadol 100 mg plus metamizol 1000 mg every 4 h for 3 days. We placed the catheter just below the parietal pleura along the paravertebral sulcus at the level of T5-T7. At the end of the operation and every 4 h thereafter, the patients received either 1.5 mg kg(-1) bupivacaine (bupivacaine group) or 0.2 mg kg(-1) morphine sulfate (morphine group) with paravertebral subpleural catheter for 3 days. Data regarding demographics, visual analog pain scores, need for supplementary intravenous analgesia, pulmonary function tests, and postoperative pulmonary complications were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: Visual analog pain scores (visual analog scale (VAS)) were lower in the morphine and bupivacaine groups compared with control group at all postoperative time points. The mean postoperative VAS was significantly different between the control and bupivacaine groups at postoperative hour 12, the control and morphine groups at postoperative hours 6, 12, 48, and 72, and the bupivacaine and morphine groups at postoperative hours 6 and 24 (p<0.05). In the control group, additional analgesic requirement was significantly higher than in the bupivacaine and morphine groups (p<0.05). Postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in three patients (20%) in the control group, in two patients (13%) in the bupivacaine group, and in one (6%) in the morphine group. CONCLUSIONS: The patients undergoing lung resection through a thoracotomy were observed with reduced postoperative pain and better surgical outcomes with respect to the length of hospital stay, postoperative forced expiratory volume in the first second, pulmonary complications, and need for bronchoscopic management, when paravertebral subpleural analgesia was induced by morphine.",eng,1

A second objective was to determine the effect of such treatment on the incidence and characteristics of phantom limb pain 6 months or more after surgery in the same patients. The study design was retrospective, unblinded, controlled (postoperative pain), and unblinded questionnaire and interview (phantom pain) were utilized. Subjects were inpatients at Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA. Nineteen bupivacaine-treated and 40 nonbupivacaine-treated patients who underwent lower extremity amputation subsequent to trauma, infection, long-standing injury (poor or no function), congenital deformity, or burns were evaluated in the postoperative pain management assessment. Nine treated and 12 untreated patients were interviewed in the phantom pain assessment. Bupivacaine 0.5% 2-6 ml/h was infused through a polyamide 20-gauge catheter inserted into the sciatic or posterior tibial nerve sheath under direct vision at the time of surgery. All patients, treated and control, received opioid analgesics systemically during the 72-hour period of study. The postoperative opioid analgesic requirement of treated patients was compared with that of control patients who received opioid analgesics alone.

There have been several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing it performed before skin incision with that done at the end of surgery, with or without saline control. We conducted this meta-analysis to assess the influence of pre-emptive BSCPB on postoperative analgesia requirements. (Table presented) The keywords bilateral cervical plexus block and thyroid surgery were entered into Medline and EMBASE with no language restrictions to identify RCTs and published abstracts from scientific meetings. We found eight RCTs of 766 patients published between 2001 and 2010 in which ropivacaine with or without clonidine or bupivacaine/levobupivacaine with or without epinephrine had been used. The Jadad score<sup>1</sup> was 2-5 for the RCTs retrieved. The primary outcome variable was the number of patients requiring postoperative rescue analgesia in the pre-incision group. Secondary outcomes were: the number of patients requiring analgesia who had BSCPB performed at the end of surgery, intraoperative analgesic requirement in both groups, and length of hospital stay in the pre-incision group. Dichotomous data were summarized using the odds ratio (OR), M-H method, and continuous variables by inverse variance and standardized mean difference. Analyses were done using Review Manager V5.1 software and the random effects model. If given pre-emptively, BSCPB probably reduces postoperative analgesic requirements and length of hospital stay, but has no significant effect on intraoperative analgesia usage (Table 2).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 children (age 6-13 years) undergoing elective tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, intraindividual trial. After entubation and just prior to incision, 3 ml of 0.25% levobupivacaine with epinephrine was injected into one peritonsillar region while 0.9% saline was being used for the contralateral side. Amount of intraoperative blood loss, duration of tonsillectomy, postoperative pain, otalgia and hemorrhage were assessed for each side separately. Visual analog scale was used for postoperative pain assessment. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure during and after operation were also observed. The follow-up period after surgery was 10 days. RESULTS: Median visual analog scale values for the levobupivacaine with epinephrine injected side was significantly lower than the saline injected side, during the first postoperative 16h (p<0.05). There were also significant differences between the intraoperative blood losses of the two sides (p<0.05). However; no significant differences were observed with respect to duration of surgery, postoperative otalgia and hemorrhage (p>0.05).

Method Randomized studies, published in English between January 1995 and July 2011, assessing analgesic and anaesthetic interventions in adults undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery, and reporting pain scores, were retrieved from the Embase and MEDLINE databases. The efficacy and adverse effects of the analgesic techniques was assessed. The recommendations were based on procedure-specific evidence from a systematic review and supplementary transferable evidence from other relevant procedures. Results Of the 170 randomized studies identified, 12 studies were included. Overall, all approaches including ketorolac, methylprednisolone, intraperitoneal instillation of ropivacaine, intravenous lidocaine infusion, intrathecal morphine and epidural analgesia improved pain relief, reduced opioid requirements and improved bowel function. However, there were significant differences in the study designs and the variables evaluated, precluding quantitative analysis. The L'Abbe plots of the data from the epidural analgesia studies included in this review indicate that the pain scores in the nonepidural groups, although higher than those in the epidural groups, were within an acceptable level (i.e. <4/10). Conclusion Infiltration of surgical incisions with local anaesthetic at the end of surgery, systemic steroids, conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors in combination with paracetamol with opioid used as rescue are recommended. Intravenous lidocaine infusion is recommended, but not as the first line of therapy. However, neuraxial blocks (i.e. epidural analgesia and spinal morphine) are not necessary based on high risk:benefit ratio. 2012 The Authors.

Methods: A prospective double-blinded randomized control trial with a paired design was performed on 25 consecutive adults undergoing a tonsillectomy. One side was injected with saline and the other side with ropivacaine. Patients were also pre-randomized into those receiving injections immediately before or after the tonsillectomy. Laterality of the injection was alternated and all surgery performed by the senior author. Patient responses were obtained via telephone interview and written questionnaire. Results: 3/25 patients were excluded from the study. 16/22 patients had pain lateralize to one side during recovery. There was no statistically significant difference in pain control between ropivacaine and normal saline. Local anesthetic decreased pain in 7/22 patients while more pain was experienced on the side with local anesthetic in 9/22 patients. 6/22 patients had no difference in pain. The time to equalization of pain based on laterality was 8.8 and 6.8 days, respectively, in the pre- and post-tonsillectomy group. Conclusions: Multiple studies have examined the role of local anesthetic in controlling post-tonsillectomy pain with equivocal results. This is the first study examining the role of local anesthetic in tonsillectomies using a paired design. Administration of ropivacaine does not affect post-tonsillectomy pain. Moreover, timing of injection does not have an effect on postoperative pain. We recommend against the use of intraoperative ropivacaine for pain control in patients undergoing tonsillectomy.",English,0

Kumar,2009.0,Buprenorphine with bupivacaine for intraoral nerve blocks to provide postoperative analgesia in outpatients after minor oral surgery,10.1016/j.joms.2009.07.014,"PURPOSE: The demonstration that opioid receptors exist in the peripheral nervous system offers the possibility of providing postoperative analgesia in the ambulatory surgical patient. Over the previous decade, many investigators have studied this approach and have compared the efficacy of various opioids added to the local anesthetic near the brachial plexus; and it appears from several of these studies that buprenorphine provides the longest duration of analgesia, the most important parameter of postoperative analgesia in outpatients. One of these studies indicated that the agonist-antagonist, buprenorphine, added to bupivacaine provided a longer period of postoperative analgesia than the traditional opiates, but none of the studies was performed in patients undergoing minor oral surgery to check the efficacy of buprenorphine to provide postoperative analgesia in dental patients. The present study was undertaken to ascertain the efficacy of buprenorphine in providing prolonged postoperative analgesia when added to 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty healthy, consenting adult patients scheduled for upper extremity surgery were enrolled in the study. Patients were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 equal groups based on the agents used for the blocks. Patients in group I received 40 mL of a local anesthetic alone, and those in group II received the same local anesthetic plus buprenorphine 0.3 mg. The study was kept double-blind by having one dentist prepare the solutions, a second dentist perform the blocks, and a third dentist monitor the anesthesia and analgesia thereafter, up to and including the time of the first request for an analgesic medication. The data were reported as means +/- standard errors of the mean, and differences between groups were determined using t test. A P value less than .01 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean duration of postoperative pain relief after injection of the local anesthetic alone was 8.34 +/- 0.11 hours compared with 28.18 +/- 1.02 hours after buprenorphine was added, a difference that was statistically (and clinically) significant (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The addition of buprenorphine to the local anesthetic used for intraoral nerve blocks in the present study provided a 3-fold increase in the duration of postoperative analgesia, with complete analgesia persisting 30 hours beyond the duration provided by the local anesthetic alone in 75% of patients. This practice can be of particular benefit to patients undergoing minor oral surgery by providing prolonged analgesia after discharge from the hospital.",eng,0

But, its effect post laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal hernia repair (TEP) is not clear. In this study, we evaluated the analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided TAPB in TEP. Methods: In this prospective, randomized study, forty adult patients (ASA I-II) scheduled for a TEP under general anesthesia were studied. In the TAPB group (n = 20), an ultrasound-guided bilateral TAPB was performed with 0.375% ropivacaine 15 ml on each side after the induction of general anesthesia. The control group (n = 20) did not have TAPB performed. Fentanyl 50 mug was repeatedly injected as per the patient's request in the recovery room. Pain scores at rest and on coughing were assessed postoperatively in the recovery room (20 min, at discharge) and at 4, 8, and 24 hours after surgery. Results: In the recovery room, pain scores (numeric rating scale, 0-10) at postoperative 20 min were lower in the TAPB group (3.9 + 1.6, 4.9 + 1.8) than the control group (6.9 + 1.6, 8.0 + 1.6) at rest and on coughing.

METHODS: The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Seventy-five healthy women were randomized to receive a preoperative infiltration with 0.5% ropivacaine, 0.25% ropivacaine, or saline. Postoperative quality of recovery score (QoR-40), pain, and opioid consumption were assessed up to 24 hours after the surgical procedure. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Post hoc pair-wise comparisons were made using Dunn test. P<.05 was required to reject the null hypothesis. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients completed the study. Patients' baseline characteristics and surgical factors were not different between groups. The ropivacaine group experienced a better quality recovery and less postoperative pain than the saline group. The median difference (99.2% confidence interval) in global recovery scores at 24 hours after surgery was 28 (QoR score 4-39, P=.001) for ropivacaine 0.5% and 28 (QoR score 10-43, P<.001) for ropivacaine 0.25% compared with saline, respectively. The 0.5% ropivacaine group also had less pain, lower opioid consumption, and faster postanesthesia care unit discharge than the saline group. Linear regression demonstrated an inverse relationship between opioid consumption and global quality of recovery at 24 hours (P<.001). CONCLUSION: The transversus abdominis plane infiltration improves quality of recovery. There was an inverse linear relationship between postoperative opioid consumption and quality of recovery.

METHODS: Eighty-two children aged 3 months to 10 years undergoing cleft lip repair were prospectively randomized to one of two groups: bilateral infraorbital nerve block (Group B), or i.v. fentanyl (Group F). Group B (n = 41) received bilateral infraorbital injection of 1 ml 0.25% bupivacaine and 2 ml i.v. saline as control. Group F (n = 41) received 2 microg x kg(-1) i.v. fentanyl, and bilateral infraorbital injection of 1 ml saline as control. Pain was evaluated by the incidence of tachycardia, hypertension, and/or modified pain score > or =4. The time to awakening, time to first cry and time to feeding were noted. RESULTS: Thirty four children (82.9%) in Group B had adequate analgesia compared with 15 (36.6%) in Group F (P < 0.0001, RR of failure 0.27 for Group B). Group B had a mean time to awakening of 5.65 +/- 2.52 min (Group F: 9.37 +/- 4.50 min; P < 0.0001), time to first cry 32.14 +/- 18.22 min (Group F: 28.00 +/- 16.27 min; P = 0.3), time to feed 62.05 +/- 20.06 min (Group F: 72.44 +/- 17.72; P = 0.015), and pain score 2.81 +/- 1.38 (Group F: 4.71 +/- 1.89; P < 0.0001). There were no major complications. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral infraorbital block is superior to fentanyl in terms of analgesia, and time to awakening and feeding.",eng,1

Impact of local analgesia timing on postoperative pain in laparoscopic surgery: a systematic review and metaanalysis,10.1007/s00464-010-1111-1,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the effect of local anesthesia administered before laparoscopic surgery (preemptive anesthesia) on postoperative pain. METHODS: The authors searched Medline, EMBase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, as well as reference lists of textbooks and relevant articles. They contacted experts in the field of anesthesia and laparoscopic surgery for randomized controlled trials comparing preemptive administration of local anesthesia at the incision site or intraperitoneally with postoperative anesthesia administration or placebo. Trials were systematically assessed for eligibility and validity, and data were extracted in duplicate. The data were pooled across studies using a random effects model. RESULTS: The 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. Preemptive incisional local anesthetic was superior to placebo in terms of visual analog pain scores (VAS) at 4 h (weighted mean difference [WMD], -9.49 mm; 95% confidence interval [CI], -15.50 to -3.48) and 24 h (WMD, -4.75 mm; 95%CI, -8.90 to 0.60). However, no difference was found between these measures and those for postoperative incision-site infiltration. Preemptive intraperitoneal local anesthetic was superior to placebo in terms of VAS at 4 h (WMD, 5.76 mm; 95%CI, -11.27 to -0.25), 8 h (WMD, -9.64 mm; 95%CI, -13.68 to -5.60), 12 h (WMD, -4.68 mm; 95%CI, -5.86 to -3.49), and 24 h (WMD, -5.57 mm; 95%CI, -8.35 to -2.79), and superior to postoperative anesthesia administration at 8 h (WMD, -7.42; 95%CI, -13.40 to -1.45), 12 h (WMD, -7.27 mm; 95%CI, -10.26 to -4.28), and 24 h (WMD, -7.95 mm; 95%CI, -12.33 to -3.56). CONCLUSION: Preemptive administration of local anesthetic at the incision site reduces postoperative pain compared with placebo but achieves an analgesic effect similar to that of postincisional anesthetic infiltration. Preemptive local anesthetic administered intraperitoneally decreases postoperative pain compared with both placebo and postoperative infiltration. Surgeons should use local analgesia in laparoscopic surgery to decrease postoperative pain, but the timing of administration is significant only for intraperitoneal infiltration.",eng,0

Its efficacy in children remains unclear, with no randomized clinical trials in this population. In this study, we evaluated its analgesic efficacy over the first 48 postoperative hours after appendectomy performed through an open abdominal incision, in a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. METHODS: Forty children undergoing appendectomy were randomized to undergo unilateral TAP block with ropivacaine (n = 19) versus placebo (n = 21) in addition to standard postoperative analgesia comprising IV morphine analgesia and regular diclofenac and acetaminophen. All patients received a standard general anesthetic, and after induction of anesthesia, a TAP block was performed using the landmark technique with 2.5 mg . kg(-1) ropivacaine 0.75% or an equal volume (0.3 mL . kg(-1)) of saline on the ipsilateral side to the incision. RESULTS: The TAP block with ropivacaine reduced mean (+/- SD) morphine requirements in the first 48 postoperative hours (10.3 +/- 12.7 vs 22.3 +/- 14.7 mg; P < 0.01) compared with placebo block. The TAP block also reduced postoperative visual analog scale pain scores at rest and on movement compared with placebo. Interval morphine consumption was reduced over the first 24 postoperative hours. There were no between-group differences in the incidence of sedation or nausea and vomiting. There were no complications attributable to the TAP block. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral TAP block, as a component of a multimodal analgesic regimen, provided superior analgesia compared with placebo in the first 48 postoperative hours after appendectomy in children.",eng,1

Niraj etal recently published a similar trial (2) that compared Epidural to TAP by giving intermittent bolus doses. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare continuous Epidural Catheter Technique vs TAP Catheter Technique for Abdominal Surgery in regards to technical difficulty, analgesic efficacy, and patient satisfaction. Method. Ethical committee approval obtained for randomised control trial for 40 patients after written informed consent undergoing elective major abdominal surgery for year 2010-2011; the epidural group (n=20) receiving preoperative epidural catheter and TAP group (n=20) receiving Tap block with catheter post procedure. Epidural group received 8-15ml of 0.2% ropivacaine of bolus dose. TAP group received ropivacaine bolus of 0.375% 20ml each side followed by 0.2%ropivacaine infusion to run at 8ml/hr each side. Both groups received acetaminophen and patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with fentanyl for 3 days. The following parameters were registered:  Numerical Rating Scores for Pain (NRS-P; 0-10) at rest and on coughing in PACU at 0 and I hour and in the postoperative ward at 24 hrs, 48 hrs, and 72 hrs. "" Fentanyl use in PACU and postoperative ward on day 1, day 2, and day 3. "" Procedure related: Technical issues, duration of introduction of catheter(s), Potential side effects or complications in relation to the technique used and any rescue medication used. Also a 4 point 'Likert'-scale was be used on day 3 and during a follow-up telephone call at one month to assess patient satisfaction with the analgesic technique used. Results: There were 19 in epidural and 20 in TAP group as one patient in epidural was excluded as it was not possible to insert. There was no difference between the gender and age technique. Using Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann Whitney) test; pain scores over time in both the groups in recovery, day 1-3 at rest and on coughing, there was no difference. Similar results were noted for Likert satisfaction scores. The total fentanyl requirement in Epidural and Tap group by using Two sample t test with equal variance was SEM 2916.83+370.51td (CI 2135.125-3698.541) and 2882.857+396.906 (CI 2054.926-3710.789) respectively. Conclusion: The TAP group and Epidural have achieved similar pain scores and rescue analgesia fentanyl used was also similar. TAP block may be considered as alternative analgesic technique but more randomised trials are needed.""",English,0

A previous study showed better analgesic effect when local anesthetic was applied in the subfascial, rather than the subcutaneous, layer. The present study investigated the effect of frequent bolus injections of bupivacaine (15 mL 2.5 mg/mL) preperitoneally through catheters placed intraoperatively in women who had undergone hysterectomy. METHODS: Postoperative pain and analgesic requirements were studied in a double-blind randomized trial including 41 patients. During surgery, the patients were randomized to one of two groups, and the investigators were blinded. Prior to closure of the peritoneum, the surgeon placed a catheter between the muscle layer and the peritoneum on each side of the wound. One group (n = 22) received bupivacaine (15 mL 2.5 mg/mL) every 4 hours for 48 hours via each catheter starting in the operating room. The placebo group (n = 19) received saline in a like manner. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS) twice a day for 2 days at rest and on movement. Requirements of supplementary analgesics were monitored, as was wound infection after discharge. RESULTS: Bupivacaine administered preperitoneally did not improve analgesia at rest, during coughing, or during mobilization compared with saline. No difference between the groups was found regarding analgesic requirements. No complications of postoperative wound healing or toxic side effects were seen. CONCLUSION: Bolus injections of bupivacaine through intraoperative placed catheters did not improve analgesia postoperatively compared with saline injections.",eng,1

We have undertaken a randomized, prospective double-blind trial of two different local anaesthetic regimes to evaluate the effect of this technique on post-thoracotomy pain relief and pulmonary function. Sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive bupivacaine 0.25% (n = 22), lignocaine 1% (n = 21) or 0.9% NaCl (saline) (n = 20) via an extrapleural catheter, inserted peroperatively. All patients underwent a standard posterolateral thoracotomy. Pain was assessed using a visual analogue pain score and by the requirement for opiate analgesia. Pulmonary function was measured using bedside spirometry. Pain scores were lower in the local anaesthetic groups at 24, 32 and 72 h compared with placebo (P < 0.05) and the total amount of opiate required was less than placebo for both lignocaine and bupivicaine (P < 0.05). Pulmonary function was better in the local anaesthetic groups throughout the post-operative period and was most pronounced at 24 h with a mean improvement of 30% for forced expiratory volume (FEV1), 24% for forced vital capacity (FVC) and 19% for peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) compared with placebo. There was no significant difference between pain scores, opiate requirement or pulmonary function between lignocaine and bupivicaine. CT scanning demonstrated containment of the local anaesthetic in an extra-pleural tunnel. Extra-pleural infusion of local anaesthetics is a simple technique, with low risk of complications and provides effective pain relief as well as an improvement in post-operative pulmonary function. Lignocaine is equally as effective as bupivacaine and its use would result in some cost-saving.",eng,1

METHODS: Subjects (n=124) were randomized to treatment with 0.25% bupivacaine (Group B) (n=42), 0.20% ropivacaine (Group R) (n=39), or no injection (Group C) (n=43). The opioid doses and the times of administration as well as child-reported pain severity (Faces Pain Scale-Revised) and parent-reported pain severity (Total Quality Pain Management survey) were recorded. RESULTS: The proportion of subjects who required morphine and/or fentanyl injections was significantly (p=0.004) lower in Group B (10%) as compared with Group R (36%) and Group C (44%). On the basis of the log-rank test, the opioid-free survival rates were significantly greater in Group B as compared to Groups C and R. Total opioid consumption (morphine equivalent mg/kg) in the first seventy-two hours postoperatively was significantly less in Group B as compared with Group C (mean difference, 0.225; [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0152 to 0.435]; p=0.036). Parent-reported pain scores were also significantly lower in Group B as compared with both Group C (mean difference, 1.81 [95% CI, 0.38 to 3.25]; p=0.014) and Group R (mean difference, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.20 to 3.12; p=0.027). There were no significant differences across the three groups in terms of self-reported pain. Differences between Groups R and C were not significant for any of the outcome variables.

We performed a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the analgesic efficacy of bilateral superficial cervical plexus blocks performed at the end of surgery. Ninety patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery by the same surgeon under general anesthesia were randomized to receive 20 mL isotonic sodium chloride or 20 mL bupivacaine 0.25% with 1:200,000 epinephrine. Postoperative pain was assessed every 4 h using an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS-11). All patients received acetaminophen every 6 h. In addition, morphine was administered following a standardized protocol if the NRS-11 score was > or = 4. The main outcome variables were pain scores (NRS-11), the proportion of patients given morphine at any time during the 24-h period, and the amount of morphine administered. The Bupivacaine group had a smaller proportion of patients given morphine (66.0% vs 90.0%; P = 0.016), and lower initial median pain scores (P = 0.002).

We compared SPVB with no block in children undergoing appendectomy. METHODS: Thirty-six children aged 3-16 yr undergoing open appendectomy were involved in this prospective randomized controlled study. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane in N(2)O/oxygen. All subjects received fentanyl, acetaminophen and ketorolac during anesthesia. Group I (SPVB) subjects received a right SPVB at T(11), T(12), and L(1) using 0.2% ropivacaine 0.25 mL.kg(-1) with epinephrine 1:200,000 preoperatively. Group II (Control) had only bandaids applied to skin. Both groups were given morphine 0.05 mg.kg(-1) iv every 2 hr if pain scores reached 5/10 on a visual analogue scale. Acetaminophen was administered postoperatively every 6 hr to both groups. Time to first dose of morphine, total dose of morphine in 24 hr, and any adverse effects up to 24 hr after surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Group I (SPVB) subjects required significantly less morphine than Group II (Control) patients (0.12 +/- 0.07 vs 0.34 +/- 0.15 mg.kg(-1), respectively; P < 0.001), and time to their first dose was significantly longer (7.1 +/- 4.4 vs 2.5 +/- 1.6 hr, respectively; P < 0.001).

In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study, we examined the efficacy of a great auricular nerve (GAN) block compared with IV morphine sulfate in children undergoing tympanomastoid surgery. After the induction of general anesthesia, children were randomized to receive either a GAN block with 2 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine (1:200,000) and a sham IV injection of 2 mL of saline solution or a sham GAN block with 2 mL of saline solution with an IV injection of 0.1 mg/kg morphine sulfate diluted to 2 mL. Patients' objective pain scores were assessed by a blinded observer and the incidence of vomiting was recorded. The GAN-Block patients as a group required more pain rescue in the postanesthesia care unit; this difference was not statistically different from the IV-morphine group (P = 0.084). Nine GAN-Block patients never received opioid or other analgesics at any time in the first 24 h after surgery. The group that received the GAN block also had a less frequent incidence of vomiting requiring intervention (7 versus 19) during their entire hospitalization or at home (P = 0.027). The GAN-Block group also had more patients who never experienced vomiting (13 of 20 versus 5 of 20, P = 0.026). In this cohort, a peripheral nerve block decreased the overall incidence of postoperative vomiting thereby reducing associated costs. IMPLICATIONS: We prospectively compared the use of a great auricular nerve block versus IV morphine sulfate in a randomized double-blinded study in children undergoing tympanomastoid surgery. Analgesia was comparable between groups but nearly half the Block group never required additional analgesics and the number of vomiting events was nearly 66% less.",English,1

No randomized, controlled studies, however, evaluate the opioid-sparing benefits of a continuous 0.2% ropivacaine infusion at the adductor canal. We hypothesized that a continuous adductor canal block would decrease postoperative opioid consumption. METHODS: Eighty subjects presenting for primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty were randomized to receive either a continuous ultrasound-guided adductor canal block with 0.2% ropivacaine or a sham catheter. All subjects received a preoperative single-injection femoral nerve block with spinal anesthesia as is standard of care at our institution. Cumulative IV morphine consumption 48 hours after surgery was evaluated with analysis of covariance, adjusted for baseline characteristics. Secondary outcomes included resting pain scores (numeric rating scale), peak pain scores during physical therapy on postoperative days 1 and 2, quadriceps maximum voluntary isometric contraction, distance ambulated during physical therapy, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and satisfaction with analgesia. RESULTS: Eighty subjects were randomized, and 76 completed the study per-protocol. The least-square mean difference in cumulative morphine consumption over 48 hours (block-sham) was--16.68 mg (95% confidence interval, -29.78 to -3.59, P = 0.013). Total morphine use between 24 and 48 hours (after predicted femoral nerve block resolution) also differed by least-square mean -11.17 mg (95% confidence interval,: -19.93 to -2.42, P = 0.013). Intention-to-treat analysis was similar to the per-protocol results. Functional outcomes revealed subjects in the adductor canal catheter group had better quadriceps strength (P = 0.010) and further distance ambulated (P = 0.034) on postoperative day 2. CONCLUSIONS: A continuous adductor canal block for total knee arthroplasty reduces opioid consumption compared with that of placebo in the first 48 hours after surgery. Other outcomes including quadriceps strength, distance ambulated, and pain scores all show benefit from an adductor canal catheter after total knee arthroplasty but require further study before being interpreted as conclusive.",eng,1

There was a significant increase in plasma concentrations of cortisol from baseline in both the epidural and paravertebral groups and in plasma glucose concentrations in the epidural group, but no significant change from baseline in plasma glucose in the paravertebral group. Areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves for cortisol and glucose were significantly lower in the paravertebral groups. Side effects, especially nausea, vomiting and hypotension, were troublesome only in the epidural group. We conclude that with these regimens, paravertebral block was superior to epidural bupivacaine.",eng,1

Epidural block (EB) is considered the gold standard for its control. Paravertebral block (PVB) is an option for the management of postoperative pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate by meta-analyses the effectiveness of continuous thoracic epidural and paravertebral blocks for pain management after thoracotomy and the incidence of adverse effects. METHOD: The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. We analyzed primary (postoperative pain at rest) and secondary outcomes (urinary retention, nausea, vomiting, hypotension). We estimated the weighted mean difference for continuous variables and odds ratios for categorical variables. RESULTS: We included eight prospective, randomized, controlled studies. Meta-analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the two techniques regarding the outcomes of postoperative pain at rest at four, eight, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and 48 hours. Incidence of urinary retention was higher in EP group (OR = 7.19, CI95 = 1.87 to 27.7). The occurrence of hypotension was higher in PVB group (OR = 10.28, 95 = 2.95 to 35.77). There was no statistically significant difference between both groups regarding the outcome nausea/vomiting (OR = 3.00, CI95 = 0.49 to 18.45). CONCLUSION: There were no statistically significant differences in pain relief after thoracotomy between EB and PVB. PVB showed a lower incidence of side effects with reduced frequency of urinary retention and hypotension.",eng,1

Forty patients were randomly divided into: Group C, receiving intramuscular oxycodone on request following an intraoperative intercostal block; Group IC, intercostal blocks with 0.5% bupivacaine performed prior to surgery, 6 h later and on the first postoperative morning: Group EB, epidural bupivacaine as a continuous infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine (5 ml h-1); Group EM4 epidural morphine 4 mg injected prior to surgery and on the first postoperative morning. In addition, a fifth group (Group EM6) of 11 patients received 6 mg of epidural morphine timed as in Group EM4, but these patients were automatically scheduled to be observed in the ICU. Additional intramuscular oxycodone was given on request to all patients. Group EB, EM4 and EM6 had lower numbers of requests than Group C. Pain intensity score was lowest (2.5 on a scale from 0 to 10, 3 h postoperatively) in Group EM6, and there was a statistically significant difference in pain intensity at 3 h between EM4 and EM6. The evaluation of cooperation and pain by the physical therapist revealed no differences between the groups.

Comparison with interscalene block,10.1016/s0034-7094(13)70197-1,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Shoulder arthroscopic surgeries evolve with intense postoperative pain. Several analgesic techniques have been advocated. The aim of this study was to compare suprascapular and axillary nerve blocks in shoulder arthroscopy using the interscalene approach to brachial plexus blockade. METHODS: According to the technique used, sixty-eight patients were allocated into two groups: interscalene group (IG, n=34) and selective group (SG, n=34), with neurostimulation approach used for both techniques. After appropriate motor response, IG received 30 mL of 0.33% levobupivacaine in 50% enantiomeric excess with adrenalin 1:200,000. After motor response of suprascapular and axillary nerves, SG received 15 mL of the same substance on each nerve. General anesthesia was then administered. Variables assessed were time to perform the blocks, analgesia, opioid consumption, motor block, cardiovascular stability, patient satisfaction and acceptability. RESULTS: Time for interscalene blockade was significantly shorter than for selective blockade. Analgesia was significantly higher in the immediate postoperative period in IG and in the late postoperative period in SG. Morphine consumption was significantly higher in the first hour in SG. Motor block was significantly lower in SG. There was no difference between groups regarding cardiocirculatory stability and patient satisfaction and acceptability. Failure occurred in IG (1) and SG (2). CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques are safe, effective, and with the same degree of satisfaction and acceptability.

Shoeibi,2014.0,Efficacy of transversus abdominis plane block for acute postoperative pain relief in kidney recipients: a double-blinded clinical trial,10.1111/pme.12311,"BACKGROUND: After renal transplantation, postoperative pain is usually mild to moderate. Postoperative pain is a concern and administration of systemic analgesic may be difficult because of underlying co-morbidities and variable responses of the graft. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is one of the different approaches for postoperative pain relief following abdominal surgeries. We evaluated analgesic efficacy of TAP block on early postoperative pain by numeric rating scale (NRS) and morphine consumption during the first 24 hours after kidney transplantation. METHODS: Forty-four patients, scheduled as kidney recipients were randomized into two equal groups and were anesthetized with the same technique. After the induction of anesthesia, 15 mL of 0.25% Bupivacaine plus 5 mu/ml epinephrine or saline was deposited into the transversus abdominis neuro-fascial plane on the side of surgery by ultrasound guide. Each patient was assessed by a blinded investigator using NRS at 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th, and 24th hour postoperatively. RESULTS: Demographic data were not significantly different between the study groups. There was significant difference in median of NRS score measured at all time points in the study groups (P < 0.001). The 24-hour morphine consumption (mean +/- SD) was 10.8 +/- 9.5 mg in bupivacaine group compared with 41.2 +/- 3.8 mg in the saline group (P = 0.001). There was statistically significant reduction in intraoperative fentanyl consumption in the TAP group 120 +/- 20 mug compared to the control group 358 +/- 24 mug (P = 0.001). In study group 4 patients and in control group 90 patients received morphine titration for pain relief (P = 0.03). There was no complication in the study groups related to nerve block. Only two patients in saline group had nausea (P = 0.07). None of our patients received any other oral or IV rescue medication.

Adverse effects from opioids and continuous epidural block (CEB) limit their use in children. Continuous popliteal nerve blocks (CPNB) have not been studied for this indication in children. In this prospective, randomized study we evaluated the effectiveness and adverse events of CPNB or CEB in children after podiatric surgery. Fifty-two children scheduled for foot surgery were separated into four groups by age and analgesia technique. After general anesthesia, 0.5 to 1 mL/kg of an equal-volume mixture of 0.25% bupivacaine and 1% lidocaine with 1:200000 epinephrine was injected via epidural or popliteal catheters. In the postoperative period, 0.1 mL x kg(-1) x h(-1) (group CPNB) or 0.2 mL x kg(-1) x h(-1) (group CEB) of 0.2% ropivacaine was administered for 48 h. Niflumic acid was routinely used. Adverse events were noted in each treatment group. Postoperative pain during motion was evaluated at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 h. Requirement for rescue analgesia (first-line propacetamol 30 mg/kg 4 times daily or second-line 0.2 mg/kg IV nalbuphine), and motor blockade were recorded. Parental satisfaction was noted at 48 h. Twenty-seven patients were included in the CEB groups and 25 in CPNB groups. There were 32 children 1 to 6 yr of age (CPNB = 15; CEB = 17) and 20 children 7 to 12 yr of age (CPNB = 10; CEB = 10). The demographic data were comparable among groups. Postoperative analgesia was excellent for the two continuous block techniques and in the two age groups. Motor block intensity was equal between techniques. Adverse events (postoperative nausea or vomiting, urinary retention, and premature discontinuation of local anesthetic infusion in the 1- to 6-yr-old group) were significantly more frequent in the CEB group (P < 0.05). Eighty-six percent of the parents in the CEB groups and 100% in the CPNB groups were satisfied. We conclude that although both CEB and CPNB resulted in excellent postoperative analgesia in this study, CPNB was associated with less urinary retention and nausea and vomiting. Therefore, we recommend CPNB as the ideal form of postoperative analgesia after major podiatric surgery in 1- to 12-yr-old children.",eng,0

METHODS: We conducted this randomized controlled clinical study on 61 patients. The study was conducted in the operation room, post-anesthesia care unit, and inpatient clinic. We randomly grouped the 61 patients into control group (group C), block group (group B) and dexketoprofen-block group (group DB). Before the skin incision performed after anesthesia induction, we performed ilioinguinal iliohypogastric block (group C given saline and group P and DB given levobupivacaine). In contrast to group C and B, group DB was given dexketoprofen. We administered morphine analgesia to all patients by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) during the postoperative 24 hours. We recorded Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), satisfaction scores, morphine consumption and side effects during postoperative 24 hours. RESULTS: We found the DB group's VAS scores to be lower than the control group and block group's (p < 0.05) values at postoperative 1(st), 2(nd), 6(th) and 12(th) hours. VAS scores of group C were higher than of group B at postoperative first 2 hours. Time to first PCA demand was longer, morphine consumption values were lower and satisfaction scores were higher in group DB than in the other two groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block with IV dexketoprofen increases patient satisfaction by decreasing opioid consumption, increasing patient satisfaction, which suggests that dexketoprofen trometamol is an effective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic in postoperative analgesia.",eng,1

To see whether plasma levels of lidocaine with and without epinephrine and of plain bupivacaine would reach toxic ranges. Finally, to evaluate the duration of postoperative analgesia following general anesthesia and regional anesthesia with two different local anesthetics. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind study, with control group administered general anesthesia. SETTING: Gynecologic operating room of a university hospital. PATIENTS: 48 adult ASA physical status I and II otherwise healthy patients undergoing lumpectomy. INTERVENTIONS: 36 patients received ICNB of T3-T6 unilaterally using either 4 ml/segment of 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine 3.75 micrograms/ml (n = 10, Group A), 4 ml/segment of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 5 micrograms/ml (n = 13, Group B), or 4 ml/segment of plain 0.5% bupivacaine (n = 13, Group C). The control group consisted of 12 patients (Group D) who received a general anesthetic using propofol, alfentanil, and nitrous oxide in oxygen for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In all three ICNB groups, the highest plasma concentrations were reached after 5 to 10 minutes following ICNB--i.e., a lidocaine plasma level of 2.77 +/- 0.5 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SEM) in Group A, a lidocaine plasma level of 2.78 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml in Group B, and a bupivacaine plasma level of 1.44 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml in Group C. There were no significant differences in plasma levels between 1.5% lidocaine and 2% lidocaine. For the first 90 minutes after surgery, higher postoperative pain scores were found in the control group than in the ICNB groups. Notably longer-lasting postoperative pain relief was achieved with plain bupivacaine. The number of women requiring postoperative analgesic medication, the time of first request, and the total amount of analgesic drugs administered during the 24 hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the regional anesthesia groups than in the general anesthesia group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ICNB is an alternative to general anesthesia for female breast surgery. Both lidocaine with epinephrine and plain bupivacaine in the doses used did not raise venous plasma concentrations to levels considered potentially toxic. With respect to duration of postoperative pain relief and analgesic drug request, the local anesthetics (in particular, bupivacaine) were found to be superior to general anesthesia.",eng,0

A catheter-based delivery method that has demonstrated effectiveness and safety in other laparoscopic and open procedures (ON-Q, I Flow Corporation) was used to deliver pain medicine. This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy of continuous infusion of local anesthetic to the diaphragm closure post laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair. Methods: After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, qualifying patients undergoing laparoscopic repair of hiatal hernia voluntarily consented to the study protocol. Standard techniques for routine closure of hiatal hernia repair were used. The ON-Q pain pump catheter was placed adjacent to the sutures used to repair the hiatal hernia, so that it rested between the diaphragm and the collagen patch used to reinforce the hernia repair. The pump infused either bupivacaine 0.5% or NaCl 0.9% at 2 cc/h for 5 days postoperatively. Patients kept a daily diary for pain scores, number of narcotic pain pills taken, and number of nausea pills taken. Results: Of the 46 patients enrolled in the study, seven were dropped for adverse events or noncompliance; 20 were given placebo (0.9% NaCl) and 19 were given 0.5% bupivacaine. Conclusion: This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed no advantage in using the ON-Q pain pump in terms of providing measurable reduction of pain or concomitant narcotic or nausea medication use.

Venkata Rama Mohan,2012.0,Comparative evaluation of continuous lumbar paravertebral versus continuous epidural block for post-operative pain relief in hip surgeries,10.5812/kowsar.22287523.3348,"BACKGROUND: Effective control of postoperative pain remains one of the most important and pressing issues in the field of surgery and has a significant impact on our health care system. In too many patients, pain is treated inadequately, causing them needless suffering and they can develop complications as an indirect consequence of pain. Analgesic modalities, if properly applied, can prevent or at least minimize this needless suffering and these complications. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of continuous infusions of local anesthetic drugs by paravertebral and epidural routes in controlling postoperative pain in patients undergoing hip surgeries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 60 patients who were undergoing hip surgery under the subarachnoid block. They were randomly divided into 2 groups of 30 patients. Group I (paravertebral group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 2.5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at 5 mL/h in the paravertebral space. Group II (epidural group) received a single dose of spinal anesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine (heavy) + a continuous infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine at a rate of 5 mL/hr in the epidural space for 48 hours in the postoperative period. Visual analogue scale (VAS) score, vital statistics, rescue analgesia, and procedure time were compared with the corresponding times between the 2 groups by student's t-test and repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni. P < 0.05 was considered significant. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups regarding mean pain score in the first 48 hours. RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the epidural group compared with the paravertebral group from 2 hours after start of the infusion until 48 hrs. Regional anesthesia procedure time was significantly longer in the epidural group (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding frequency of postoperative complications and catheter-related problems. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that for patients who are scheduled for hip surgery, both continuous paravertebral and continuous epidural analgesia are effective in controlling postoperative pain but that the former has several crucial advantages.",eng,1

DESIGN: Randomized, prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Labor and delivery suite at Johns Hopkins Hospital. PATIENTS: 34 women scheduled for elective cesarean delivery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive IHII nerve blocks bilaterally, with either total 24 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine or normal saline, following cesarean delivery via Pfannensteil incision with a standard intrathecal dose of 12 mg of 0.75% bupivacaine with 10 microg of fentanyl and 200 microg of preservative-free morphine. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were assessed at 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours postoperatively. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores at rest were recorded at each time period. Analgesic use, patients' perception of nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and their overall satisfaction with their analgesia were recorded for the first 24 hours. MAIN RESULTS: Lower VAS pain scores were seen in the bupivacaine group at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours postoperatively (P = 0.01, P < 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04, respectively). A longer mean time to first rescue dose of ketorolac was noted in the bupivacaine group (14.3 +/- 1.8 hrs) than the saline group (mean 5.6 +/-1.1 hrs), (P < 0.01). Fewer patients in the bupivacaine group made requests for acetaminophen 500 mg/oxycodone 5 mg in the first 24 hours. Satisfaction was greater in the bupivacaine group. No difference in side effects was noted between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral multilevel injection IHII nerve blocks result in lower resting VAS pain scores, lower analgesic requirements, and greater satisfaction following cesarean delivery in patients who received neuraxial morphine.",eng,1

This prospective, randomized trial was conducted to determine whether bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) is effective for reducing acute postoperative pain after robot-assisted endoscopic thyroidectomy (RAET) and to compare its effects with that of local wound infiltration (LWI). METHODS: Ninety-seven patients who were to undergo RAET were randomly assigned to one of three groups to receive BSCPB with either 20 mL of 0.525% ropivacaine (BSCPB group, n=32) or 20 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution (Control group, n=32) or LWI with 20 mL of 0.525% ropivacaine (LWI group, n=33). Postoperative pain scores were assessed at the postoperative anesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 6, 24, and 48 h postoperatively using a visual analog scale (VAS). Patients with VAS scores of >/=40 were administered rescue analgesics according to a standardized protocol. The main outcome variables were pain scores during the first postoperative 24 h and the number of patients requiring postoperative analgesic rescue. RESULTS: The BSCBP and LWI groups showed lower pain scores compared with the Control group at the PACU. The BSCPB group continued to show significantly lower pain scores compared with the LWI and Control groups at postoperative 6 and 24 h. The number of patients requiring analgesic rescue at the PACU was lower in the BSCPB and LWI groups than in the Control group. The number of patients requiring additional rescue analgesics after discharge from the PACU until the first 24 postoperative h was lower in the BSCPB group than in the LWI group. CONCLUSIONS: BSCPB and LWI are effective for reducing pain scores and analgesic requirements during the immediate postoperative period in patients who undergo RAET, with BSCPB being superior to LWI at postoperative 6-24 h.",eng,1

We compared their analgesic efficacy with that of epidural analgesia after major upper abdominal surgery in a randomised controlled trial. Adult patients undergoing elective open hepatobiliary or renal surgery were randomly allocated to receive subcostal TAP catheters (n=29) or epidural analgesia (n=33), in addition to a standard postoperative analgesic regimen comprising of regular paracetamol and tramadol as required. The TAP group patients received bilateral subcostal TAP catheters and 1 mg.kg(-1) bupivacaine 0.375% bilaterally every 8 h. The epidural group patients received an infusion of bupivacaine 0.125% with fentanyl 2 mug.ml(-1) . The primary outcome measure was visual analogue pain scores during coughing at 8, 24, 48 and 72 h after surgery. We found no significant differences in median (IQR [range]) visual analogue scores during coughing at 8 h between the TAP group (4.0 (2.3-6.0 [0-7.5])) and epidural group (4.0 (2.5-5.3) [0-8.5])) and at 72 h (2.0 (0.8-4.0 [0-5]) and 2.5 (1.0-5.0 [0-6]), respectively). Tramadol consumption was significantly greater in the TAP group (p=0.002).

Methods: Suitable patients aged 18-75 years (American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II) scheduled to undergo perianal surgery were randomized to SSB (10 ml 0*5 per cent hyperbaric bupivacaine) or TIVA with propofol and fentanyl by means of a laryngeal mask. Cumulative consumption of analgesics within 24 h after surgery was recorded, and postoperative recovery and patient satisfaction were evaluated. Results: A total of 201 patients were randomized. Supplemental analgesia within 24 h after surgery was required by 31 of 101 patients having SSB and 58 of 100 who had TIVA (P < 0*001). Median monitoring time in the recovery room was 5 (range 1-45) min for SSB versus 44 (4-148) min for TIVA (P < 0*001). Patients in the SSB group were able to eat and drink more quickly, although times to mobilization and micturition were not significantly different. Patients having SSB were more likely to describe the anaesthesia as 'better than expected'. Conclusion: SSB is superior to TIVA in patients undergoing perianal surgery in terms of analgesic consumption within 24 h after surgery and aspects of postoperative recovery.

We aim to compare the efficacy of caudal block versus dorsal penile block (DPNB) under general anesthesia for children undergoing circumcision. METHODS: This study was performed between July 1, 2009 and October 16, 2009. Fifty male children American Society of Anesthesiolgists physical status classification I, aged between 3 and 12 were included in this randomized, prospective, comparative study. Anesthetic techniques were standardized for all children. Patients were randomized into 2 groups. Using 0.25% 0.5 ml/kg levobupivacain, we performed DPNB for Group 1 and caudal block for Group 2. Postoperative analgesia was evaluated for six hours with the Flacc Pain Scale for five categories; (F) Face, (L) Legs, (A) Activity, (C) Cry, and (C) Consolability. For every child, supplemental analgesic amounts, times, and probable local or systemic complications were recorded. RESULTS: No significant difference between the groups (P > 0.05) was found in mean age, body weight, anesthesia duration, FLACC pain, and sedation scores (P > 0.05). However, on subsequent measurements, a significant decrease of pain and sedation scores was noted in both the DPNB group and the caudal block group (P < 0.001). No major complication was found when using either technique. CONCLUSIONS: DPNB and caudal block provided similar postoperative analgesic effects without major complications for children under general anesthesia.",eng,1

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of sub-Tenon's block with ropivacaine at the end of strabismus surgery on post-operative pain. METHODS: A prospective trial was conducted in 79 patients (age 1.0-65 years) scheduled for outpatient primary strabismus surgery with fixed sutures under general anesthesia (GA) at a major tertiary hospital. Half the patients were randomly allocated to receive sub-Tenon's block with ropivacaine 0.2% at conclusion of the operation. Primary outcome measures were visual analog scale (VAS) scores at arrival to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), at discharge 3 hr later, 12-16 hr post-operatively, and 24 hr post-operatively. Supplemental analgesia requirements and patient satisfaction were recorded as well. Data were presented as median (range). Mann-Whitney test, Pearson chi(2)-test or Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis; p <or= 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: There were no between-group differences in median VAS scores at arrival to the PACU and at discharge, with a borderline difference at 24 hr post-operatively (p = 0.06). At 12-16 hr post-operatively, the median score was 0.0 (range 0-5) in the study group and 4.0 (range 0-6) in the controls (p < 0.001). The lower VAS score in the study group was associated with a lower rate of supplemental analgesia use (21.9% versus 57.9%, p = 0.001), fewer doses of supplemental analgesia (10 doses versus 35, p = 0.03), and higher patient satisfaction (p < 0.001).

In the present double-blind study, comprising 126 inpatients aged 6-42 (mean 19) years, we investigated whether pre-incisional injection of bupivacaine during general anaesthesia reduces the pain experienced after tonsillectomy. The patients were randomized into three treatment groups: 43 patients were injected with 5 ml of bupivacaine (2.5 mg/ml) + epinephrine (5 mug/ml) solution in both tonsillar fossa, 41 had epinephrine (5 mug/ml) + saline (9 mg/ml) and 42 patients received saline (9 mg/ml) only. Self-assessment of pain during the first postoperative week (repeated measures) was recorded. Use of analgetics, experience of the surgeons, preoperative bleeding and several other clinical parameters were assessed. Analyses of covariance with repeated measures was carried out for each pain score. In general there was no statistical significant difference in pain scores, represented by a visual analogue scale (VAS) between the three treatment groups. However, injection of bupivacaine into the tonsillar fossa seemed to reduce pain shortly after the operation in the age group 19- 24 years. Further, females and older patients reported more pain and used more analgetics than males and younger patients. Increasing experience of the surgeon was related to a lower score for baseline pain shortly after the operation. Epinephrine in bupivacaine or saline reduced preoperative bleeding. We conclude that bupivacaine does not provide Significant postoperative analgesia after tonsillectomy in an unselected group of patients.",English,0

Stress response hormone levels can be used as an objective method to assess the analgesic efficacy of the anaesthetic techniques used in infraumbilical surgery in children. In this study, we compared catecholamine blood levels in children undergoing these two different supplementary analgesic/anaesthetic techniques. METHODS: Thirty male paediatric patients undergoing orchidopexy, ASA I, received inhalation general anaesthesia, and were randomly allocated to one of two groups: a caudal group (n = 15) and an ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block group (n = 15). Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were measured at the induction time, at the end of surgery, and in the postanaesthesia care unit. Postoperative pain score was also assessed in the postanaesthesia care unit. RESULTS: In both groups, there was a substantial decrease in the catecholamine blood levels; however, there were significantly higher levels of epinephrine in the ilioinguinal group at the end of surgery (P = 0.008) and in the recovery room (P = 0.02) and a significant higher level of norpinephrine in the recovery room (P = 0.008).

Slee,2013.0,"Ultrasound-guided adductor canal block for arthroscopic medial meniscectomy: a randomized, double-blind trial",10.1007/s12630-013-9992-9,"PURPOSE: The saphenous nerve block using a landmark-based approach has shown promise in reducing postoperative pain in patients undergoing arthroscopic medial meniscectomy. We hypothesized that performing an ultrasound-guided adductor canal saphenous block as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen would result in improved analgesia after arthroscopic medial meniscectomy. METHODS: Fifty patients presenting for ambulatory arthroscopic medial meniscectomy under general anesthesia were prospectively randomized to receive an ultrasound-guided adductor canal block with 0.5% ropivacaine or a sham subcutaneous injection of sterile saline. Our primary outcome was resting pain scores (numerical rating scale; NRS) upon arrival to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Secondary outcomes included NRS at six hours, 12 hr, 18 hr, and 24 hr; postoperative nausea; and postoperative opioid consumption. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in mean NRS pain scores upon arrival to the PACU (P = 0.03): block group NRS = 1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73 to 2.68) vs sham group NRS = 3.25 (95% CI 2.27 to 4.23). Cumulative opioid consumption (represented in oral morphine equivalents) over 24 hr was 71.8 mg (95% CI 56.5 to 87.2) in the sham group vs 44.9 mg (95% CI 29.5 to 60.2) in the block group (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: An ultrasound-guided block at the adductor canal as part of a combined multimodal analgesic regimen significantly reduces resting pain scores in the PACU following arthroscopic medial meniscectomy. Furthermore, 24-hr postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores were also reduced.",eng,1

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical study was performed on 60 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II patients between the ages of 18 and 60 years who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy with approval of the ethical committee and written consent of the patients. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: group P had 4 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine injected at each of the T10, T11, and T12 paravertebral spaces and a standard PVB, and group C received 4 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution. All patients were given standard general anesthesia. The follow-up of saturation, heart rate, peripheral oxygen, and blood pressure values was recorded before induction, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. At postoperative 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h, the visual analog scale (VAS), Ramsey sedation score, respiratory rate, and 24-hour total morphine consumption were recorded.

However, when epidural analgesia is contraindicated or unwanted, the administration of opioids is the usual means used to relieve pain. Various regional analgesia techniques used in conjunction with systemic analgesia have been reported to reduce the cumulative postoperative opioid consumption and opioid-induced side effects. The objective of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of transversus abdominis plane block and paravertebral block in women undergoing major gynecological surgery. METHODS: We analyzed 58 patients scheduled for a midline vertical laparatomy due to gynecological cancer. They were all equipped with a patient-controlled postoperative analgesia pump that delivered ketobemidon. In addition, some patients were randomized to receive either a bilateral transversus abdominis plane block (n = 19) or a bilateral paravertebral block at the level of Th10 (n = 19). Both blocks were performed preoperatively as a single injection of bupivacaine. RESULTS: Cumulative ketobemidon consumption, postoperative pain scores at rest and while coughing, and postoperative nausea and vomiting scores were assessed by a blinded observer at 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. Both blocks were associated with significant reductions in opioid consumption and pain scores throughout the study period compared with the control patients. Postoperative nausea and vomiting scores were low in all groups, but during the early postoperative period more control group patients needed antiemetics. CONCLUSION: Both methods of inducing block can serve as effective analgesia adjuncts in women undergoing major gynecological surgery. Although thoracic paravertebral block appeared to be more effective than transversus abdomins block, the latter performed under ultrasound guidance seems to be a more controlled and safe alternative.",eng,0

The objective of this study was to determine if a 'camera guided' nerve blockade could provide a better pain control than the usual surgical wound infiltration after VATS clipping of the sympathetic nerve. Methods: Prospective randomized study on 40 patients submitted to twoport VATS for hyperhidrosis and blushing from June 2010 to January 2012. The sample size was calculated to detect one point of minimum pain score difference with 80% statistical power. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1, intraoperative intercostal block (IIB) (n=20): under camera control, a needle was placed through one of the ports into the area of the intercostal/s nerve/s where clipping had been done and a bolus of 10 ml of local anaesthetic (levobupivacaine 0.5%) was infused (image). Group 2, surgical wounds infiltration group (SWI) (n=20): patients received infiltration of surgical wounds with 10 ml of lebovupivacaine 0.5% per side. In the postoperative period both groups of patients were given metamizol every 6 h. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, pathology, and comorbidity. Pain level was measured with the visual analogue scale (VAS) at 1, 6 and 24 h. Results: No side effects related to any of the two analgesic techniques were noted. VAS scores were the following: Group 1 (IIB): VAS 1 h: 2.3+0.7, VAS 6 h:4.2+1.1, VAS 24 h:5.0+1.1, and mean VAS:3.8+1.3. Group 2 (SWI): VAS 1 h:3.6+1.0, VAS 6 h:5.7+1.3, VAS 24 h:5.4+1.4, and mean VAS:4.9+1.4. VAS scores were significantly lower in the IIB patients (p<0.01).

The addition of a transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) to a multimodal analgesic regimen that includes intrathecal morphine may provide improved early pain outcomes and decrease the risk of chronic post-surgical pain. The purpose of this research was to assess the ability of an ultrasound-guided TAPB with low-dose ropivacaine to decrease early postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and risk of developing persistent pain when compared with a placebo block. Methods: Eighty-three women were randomly assigned to either a treatment (0.25% ropivacaine) or control group (0.9% saline) in this double-blind trial, and 74 women were included in the final analysis. Ultrasound-guided TAPBs were performed with an injection of 20 mL of study solution per side. The primary outcome measures of this study were: pain at rest and pain after movement measured with a numeric rating scale, results of the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) questionnaire, and opioid consumption at 24 hr. These were used with an a priori sample size calculation to detect a 30% reduction in pain scores, a 10% improvement in QoR-40 score, and a 50% reduction in opioid consumption. Health quality and physical functioning were assessed using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey at 30 days and six months. Results: Assessment at 24 hr after Cesarean delivery revealed no clinically important differences between groups in postoperative pain, QoR-40, or opioid consumption. There were no clinically important differences between groups regarding measures of nausea, pruritus, vomiting, urine retention (2, 24, and 48 hr postoperatively), 24-hr QoR-40 sub-dimensions, or the SF-36 Health Survey (30 days and six months postoperatively). Conclusions: Ultrasound-guided TAPB did not improve postoperative pain, quality of recovery, or opioid consumption 24 hr following surgery.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of caudal epidural analgesia with other forms of postoperative analgesia following circumcision in boys. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (to April 2008) and EMBASE (to April 2008). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of postoperative analgesia by caudal epidural block compared with non-caudal analgesia in boys, aged between 28 days and 16 years, having elective surgery for circumcision. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently carried out assessment of study eligibility, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias in included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 trials involving 721 boys. No difference was seen between caudal and parenteral analgesia in the need for rescue or other analgesia (relative risk (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 1.43; 4 trials, 235 boys; random-effects model) or on the incidence of nausea and vomiting (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.05; 4 trials, 235 boys).

No differences were seen between caudal block and DNPB in the incidence of nausea and vomiting (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 5.04; 4 trials, 334 boys; random effects model) or individual complications except for motor block (RR 17.00, 95% CI 1.01 to 286.82; 1 trial, 100 boys) and motor or leg weakness (RR 10.67, 95% CI 1.32 to 86.09; 2 trials, 107 boys). These were significantly more common in the caudal block groups than with DNPB. No differences were seen between caudal and rectal or intravenous analgesia in the need for rescue analgesia or any other outcomes (2 trials, 162 boys). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the need for rescue or other analgesia could not be detected between caudal, parenteral and penile block methods. In day-case surgery, penile block may be preferable to caudal block in children old enough to walk due to the possibility of temporary leg weakness after caudal block. Evidence from trials is limited by small numbers and poor methodology. There is a need for properly designed trials comparing caudal epidural block with other methods such as morphine, simple analgesics and topical local anaesthetic creams, emulsions or gels.",eng,1

METHODS: A total of 119 consecutive patients underwent elective thoracotomy. They were prospectively randomized into two groups. One group received an injection of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine in the planned skin incision just before thoracotomy, and the other group received an equal amount of saline and epinephrine. All patients had a functioning preoperative epidural; a skin incision the width of their latissimus dorsi muscle, which was cut; sparing of the serratus anterior muscle; undercutting of the sixth rib; intercostal nerve blocks before rib spreading; a similar number of chest tubes and pulmonary resections; and comparable postoperative pain management. Pain was objectified by a numeric pain score, a visual pain score, and by the Modified McGill pain questionnaire each day in the hospital, and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS: There were 66 patients in the lidocaine group (L group) and 53 patients in the saline group (S group). Although a trend was noted toward less pain in the L group during the first 3 postoperative days (on the numeric pain scale only) the difference was not statistically significant in overall pain in the hospital or at 3, 6, and 12 months after the operation. Other pain scores and descriptors were similar throughout. CONCLUSIONS: The injection of lidocaine and epinephrine in the skin just before thoracotomy does not decrease the amount or type of pain during the hospital stay or at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery",,0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of continuous subacromial bupivacaine infusion to relieve pain after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. We hypothesized that patients receiving continuous subacromial bupivacaine infusions after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair will have less postoperative pain in the early postoperative period than placebo and control groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were randomized in a blinded fashion into 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 received no postoperative subacromial infusion catheter. Group 2 received a postoperative subacromial infusion catheter filled with saline solution. Group 3 received a postoperative subacromial infusion catheter filled with 0.5% bupivacaine without epinephrine. Infusion catheters were scheduled to infuse at 4 mL/h for 50 hours. Postoperative pain levels were assessed with visual analog scale scores hourly for the first 6 postoperative hours, every 6 hours for the next 2 days, and then every 12 hours for the next 3 days. Patients recorded daily oxycodone consumption for the first 5 postoperative days. RESULTS: Immediately postoperative, the group with no catheter had significantly lower visual analog scale scores (P = .04). There were no significant differences in visual analog scale scores among the groups at any other time point. There were no differences found among the groups regarding mean daily oxycodone consumption. CONCLUSION: The use of continuous bupivacaine subacromial infusion catheters resulted in no detectable pain reduction after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair based on visual analog scale scores and narcotic medication consumption.",eng,0

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled prospective study. ANIMALS: Fourteen one-year-old, nongravid, healthy Holstein heifers, weighing 360 +/- 5 kg. METHODS: Xylazine (0.05 mg kg(-1)) or 0.9% saline (5 mL) was injected using a caudal epidural technique to seven heifers undergoing a flank surgery. Nerve block of the right paravertebral fossa was performed using equal parts of lidocaine 2% and bupivacaine 0.5%. Heart and respiratory rates, rectal temperature, rumination frequency, and appetite were recorded before and at 4, 8, and 24 hours after surgery. Scores were recorded for: tolerance of local anesthesia injections (pre-operatively), sedation, ataxia and distress (intraoperatively, every 30 minutes), and pain (4, 8, and 24 hours post-operatively). RESULTS: The animals reaction to local anesthetic injection was judged to be less in the xylazine group by both an experienced observer (p<0.001) and student surgeons (p<0.01). The xylazine group required less local anesthetic (82.9 +/- 13.8 mL) versus the saline group (108.4 +/- 19.6 mL, p=0.035). Intraoperatively, xylazine heifers were more sedated at all times (p-values from <0.001 to 0.017), were more ataxic for the first 1.5 hours (p-values from <0.001 to 0.026), and lower in distress at all times (p-values from <0.001 to 0.007). No difference in post-operative pain or physiologic variables was found, except immediately post-operatively, rectal temperature was higher in the xylazine group (39.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C) than in the saline group (38.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C, p<0.001). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Compared with epidural saline, caudal epidural xylazine reduced distress of anesthetic injection and surgical manipulation in heifers and an improvement in animal well-being was apparent. This effect may have been as a result of sedation. Pre-operative epidural xylazine did not appear to improve post-surgical analgesia in our study.",eng,0

The published series on the role, safety, feasibility, and efficacy of thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy are reviewed. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PREMEDLINE databases were searched, and relevant English language publications were systematically retrieved. Data were pooled by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Between 1994 and 2006, 302 patients were featured in 16 reports. The reports described 202 procedures as bilateral and 100 as unilateral. These procedures were associated with rates of 16.6% for morbidity, 1.3% for conversion to thoracotomy, 1.3% for reoperation to manage complications, and 0% for mortality. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.7 days. The mean success rate was 90% up to 6 months of follow-up evaluation, 75% at >6 to 15 months of follow-up evaluation, and 49% at >15 months to 5.7 years of follow-up evaluation. Further intervention for pain relief was required for 12.9% of the patients. CONCLUSION: Splanchnicectomy reduces pain and improves quality of life for patients with chronic pancreatitis.

Rodriguez-Merchan,2010.0,Postoperative analgesia in TKA: ropivacaine continuous intraarticular infusion,10.1007/s11999-009-1202-2,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain control is a challenge in patients undergoing TKA due to side effects and technical limitations of current analgesic approaches. Local anesthetic infiltration through continuous infusion pumps has been shown to reduce postoperative pain in previous studies. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We assessed the effectiveness of intraarticular ropivacaine infusions in reducing pain and postoperative opioid use after TKA and determined whether such infusions accelerate functional recovery of the patient and reduce length of hospital stay. METHODS: In a randomized, prospective, double-blind study, two groups were assigned: Group A (n = 25) underwent continuous intraarticular infusion with 300 mL ropivacaine 0.2% at a speed of 5 mL/hour through an elastomeric infusion pump and Group B (n = 25) had an elastomeric pump insertion with 300 mL saline solution at an infusion speed of 5 mL/hour. All patients had the same prosthesis model implanted. Parameters analyzed over the first 3 days, at discharge, and 1 month later included postoperative pain, joint function, opioid use, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: All patients in Group A showed a decrease in pain intensity measured by a visual analog scale and opioid use in the first 3 days. Mean length of hospital stay was also reduced in Group A (5.72 days) compared to Group B (7.32 days). There were no device-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an infusion pump is effective in treating pain after TKA, reducing postoperative pain and opioid use. It also improves immediate functionality and patient comfort, reducing the mean length of hospital stay, without increasing the risk of complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, therapeutic study.

Journal Article,F. Bonnet; E. Marret,2007.0,Postoperative pain management and outcome after surgery,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpa.2006.12.007,"Postoperative pain management aims not only to decrease pain intensity but also to increase patient comfort and to improve postoperative outcome. Better pain control is achieved through a multimodal combination of regional analgesic techniques and systemic administration of analgesic agents. To guarantee uneventful follow-up and unnecessary prolongation of hospital stay, it is important to avoid side-effects of analgesic agents, especially those of opioids which are dose-related, by decreasing opioid demand through combination with non-opioid agents. Epidural analgesia not only has the advantage of providing potent and effective analgesia but also of hastening recovery of bowel function and facilitating physiotherapy and rehabilitation. Unfortunately, a reduction in postoperative morbidity and mortality by epidural analgesia has not actually been demonstrated. Inclusion of postoperative pain treatment in a multimodal approach of patient rehabilitation may improve recovery and shorten hospital stay. Effective treatment of postoperative pain is also likely to prevent chronic pain syndrome after surgery, but further studies are needed to support this hypothesis. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

DESIGN: Prospective randomised study. SETTING: University hospital, Germany. SUBJECTS: 104 patients undergoing elective hernia repair. INTERVENTIONS: 52 patients were given boluses of 0.5% bupivacaine 10 ml through a subcutaneous catheter and 52 dipyrone 500 mg orally 6, 12 and 24 hours after operation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative pain measured on a visual analogue scale, complications, systemic side effects, supplementary analgesics, costs, and time taken to give the analgesics. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in absolute pain scores, course of pain, and the effects of analgesics. Thirteen patients [5 in the bupivacaine group and 8 in the dipyrone group] required additional dipyrone [mean (range) 2000 mg (500-5000) and 2500 mg (500-4000) respectively]. There were no systemic side effects of either treatment. There were 5 wound haematomas in the bupivacaine group (10%), and 2 wound haematomas and 1 superficial wound infection in the dipyrone group (6%). Mean costs of material and time taken to give the analgesics were pound sterling 104.70 and 47 minutes in the bupivacaine group compared with pound sterling 3.40 and 6 minutes in the dipyrone group. The median (range) hospital stay was 2 (1-3) days in both groups.

VR surgery in children has received little attention regarding the incidence of pain and emesis, and the role of regional anesthesia in modifying these parameters. In this study, we compared peribulbar block with conventional opioid analgesia in children undergoing VR surgery. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, single-blind study, 85 children (ages 6 to 13 years) were allocated to receive peribulbar block (n = 42) or intravenous meperidine 1 mg/kg (n = 43) after induction of general anesthesia. Parameters compared were: intraoperative incidence of oculocardiac reflex and requirement for additional analgesic; postoperative pain intensity; incidence of postoperative emesis; time to first analgesic, total number of postoperative analgesic supplements; and parental assessment of the child's postoperative comfort at 24 hours. RESULTS: The incidence of intraoperative oculocardiac reflex was significantly less in the peribulbar group (P =.0001). Significantly more children receiving peribulbar block were pain free on awakening (P =.0004) and throughout the postoperative period. The number of children requiring opioid was significantly lower with peribulbar block (P =.008), and a significant number of children did not vomit throughout the postoperative period (P =.001). CONCLUSIONS: Peribulbar block appears to be a safe and clinically superior alternative to intravenous opioid for pediatric VR surgery.",eng,1

Nine well-designed randomized trials with controversial results have been published since then. The present report constitutes an updated meta-analysis of this issue. Summary of Background: Thoracotomy is a major surgical procedure and is associated with severe postoperative pain. Epidural analgesia is the gold standard for post-thoracotomy pain management, but has its limitations and contraindications, and paravertebral blockade is increasingly popular. However, it has not been decided whether the analgesic effect of the two methods is comparable, or whether paravertebral blockade leads to a lower incidence of adverse side effects after thoracotomy. Methods: Two reviewers independently searched the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (last performed on 1 February, 2013) for reports of studies comparing post-thoracotomy epidural analgesia and paravertebral blockade. The same individuals independently extracted data from the appropriate studies. Result: Eighteen trials involving 777 patients were included in the current analysis. There was no significant difference in pain scores between paravertebral blockade and epidural analgesia at 4-8, 24, 48 hours, and the rates of pulmonary complications and morphine usage during the first 24 hours were also similar. However, paravertebral blockade was better than epidural analgesia in reducing the incidence of urinary retention (p<0.0001), nausea and vomiting (p = 0.01), hypotension (p<0.00001), and rates of failed block were lower in the paravertebral blockade group (p = 0.01). Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed that PVB can provide comparable pain relief to traditional EPI, and may have a better side-effect profile for pain relief after thoracic surgery. Further high-powered randomized trials are to need to determine whether PVB truly offers any advantages over EPI. 2014 Ding et al.",English,1

INTERVENTIONS: Patients received injections in the tonsillar fossae of isotonic sodium chloride, ropivacaine, or ropivacaine plus clonidine prior to tonsil excision. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analogue (pain) scale scores at rest and when drinking, opioid use, recovery time to normal activity, and incidence of symptoms such as otalgia. RESULTS: Pain was reduced on postoperative day 0 in the ropivacaine-treated and ropivacaine plus clonidine-treated groups as compared with the isotonic sodium chloride-treated group (P<.05). Pain was also decreased in the ropivacaine plus clonidine-treated group on postoperative days 3 and 5 (P<.05).

The present study aimed to investigate whether continuous axillary brachial plexus block with ropivacaine infusion can improve the survival of the reconstructive fingers secondary to an increase in its skin temperature in patients receiving replantation surgery of the crushed fingers. Methods: Under general anesthesia, 18 patients received replantation or toe-to-hand transplantation of their crushed digits. They were randomly divided into two groups. Under ultrasound guidance, continuous axillary brachial plexus analgesia was effected by a loading dose of 10 ml 0.75% ropivacaine, followed by an infusion of 4-5 ml per hour for up to three days (Group A). Patients who did not receive continuous analgesia postoperatively served as a control (Group B). An infrared thermometer was used to hourly assess the skin temperature of the surgical and non-surgical sites in both groups for 24 h after the surgery. In addition, the survival (the rate of re-operation or amputation) of the reconstructive digits was also evaluated in both groups. Results: The skin temperature of the digits (T1) on both groups did not show any significant difference at any point of time after the surgery albeit there was a trend of increased skin temperature on the reconstructive digits in patients receiving continuous axillary brachial plexus block (Group A) as compared to those without receiving the block (Group B). Also, the difference in skin temperature (dT) differed slightly at 0, 9 and 21 hours postoperatively in Group A in comparison with Group B (0.75 + 0.65 vs. -2.33 + 1.24, 0.53 + 0.34 vs. -3.02 + 1.27, -0.125 + 0.55 vs. -2.33 + 0.91, p < 0.05). However, no patients in both groups received a second operation or amputation of the graft. Conclusions: The result of this study demonstrated that axillary brachial plexus block with continuous infusion of 0.75% ropivacaine can increase the skin temperature, an index of tissue perfusion, of the reconstructive digits for 24 h after microvascular surgery of the crushed fingers.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of intraoperative, temporary, intercostal nerve blockade in addition to epidural analgesia for control of postthoracotomy pain. METHODS: Forty patients undergoing elective lobectomy through antero-axillary thoracotomy were randomized to receive epidural analgesia only (group A, n = 20) or epidural analgesia plus temporary, intraoperative intercostal nerve blockade using 0.25% bupivacaine (group B, n = 20). Postoperative pain was assessed using a subjective analogue visual scale, and with the Prince Henry pain scale. Food intake and nonsteroidal analgesic consumption were also investigated. Serum ACTH and cortisol in each group were measured before and after the operation. RESULTS: The analogue visual scale scores were significantly higher in group A than group B (p < 0.001), and were significantly higher on the day of operation and postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 (p < 0.001, p < 0.005, p < 0.005, p < 0.05, respectively). Prince Henry pain scale scores were significantly higher on the day of operation and postoperative day 1 (p < 0.05, p < 0.005, respectively).

Some studies have demonstrated that local anaesthetic (LA) washed over the liver and gallbladder decreases postoperative pain. In many patients pain is partially of diaphragmatic origin which may not be treated effectively by topical wash. This study assesses the efficacy of LA injected to the peritoneum of the right hemidiaphragm or topical wash with a control group. METHODS: We performed a double-blind randomized sham controlled trial of 128 consecutive subjects who underwent elective LC. Patients received subcutaneous bupivacaine, a diaphragmatic injection of bupivacaine or sham, and topical wash over the liver/gallbladder with bupivacaine or sham depending upon allocation. The primary outcome was VAS pain scores on the ward. Secondary outcomes included VRS pain scores in theatre recovery, analgesic use, physiological observations, time to eating and ambulation, and successful day-case surgery. RESULTS: Pain scores were significantly lower in both LA groups versus control in theatre recovery but only in the subperitoneal diaphragm injection group when the patients returned to the ward. Subperitoneal diaphragm injection was associated with a reduced time in theatre recovery (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Intraperitoneal techniques of LA during LC decrease postoperative pain and shorten time in theatre recovery. Injection of LA to the right hemidiaphragm is associated with lower pain scores for a longer period following LC than a previously validated wash technique.",eng,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients scheduled for bilateral mandibular third molar removal were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a double-blinded crossover design: 1) first operation: lidocaine and placebo, second operation: bupivacaine and methylprednisolone; 2) first operation: bupivacaine and methylprednisolone, second operation: lidocaine and placebo; 3) first operation: lidocaine and methylprednisolone, second operation: bupivacaine and placebo; 4) first operation: bupivacaine and placebo, second operation: lidocaine and methylprednisolone. Patient-reported pain and swelling were recorded using visual analog scales 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after surgery and daily during the first postoperative week. The treatment effects were estimated as contrasts between the average differences within the treatment groups and assessed by stratified t tests. RESULTS: A total of 126 patients (57 women and 69 men; mean age, 25.0 years) were included in the analysis. No significant interactions between local analgesia and methylprednisolone were observed.

METHODS: We studied 100 patients with body mass index > 35 kg/m2. They were randomly allocated to study (USG-TAP) and control groups. Pain scores at rest and on movement at various time points up to 24 postoperative hours were compared. Other parameters evaluated were patients requiring Tramazac hydrochloride (TMZ) as rescue analgesic, sedation score, time to ambulate, any adverse events, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The median visual analogue scale pain score of the study (USG-TAP) group was consistently lower at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h at rest and on movement, in the postoperative period. Number of patients requiring TMZ required in the first, third, and sixth hour was significantly lower in the USG-TAP group. The prolonged sedative effect of the TMZ affected the time to ambulate. Patients in the control group remained more sedated. Four patients in the control group required BIPAP support postoperatively; no adverse event was observed. Time to ambulate was 6.3 +/- 1.8 h in USG-TAP and 8 +/- 1.8 h in control groups; P < 0.001. Patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the USG-TAP group; P < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the USG-TAP as part of multimodal analgesic technique in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass reduces opioid requirement, improves pain score, decreases sedation, promotes early ambulation, and has greater patient satisfaction.",eng,1

Gopalakrishnan,2013.0,Randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of bilateral superficial cervical plexus block in thyroidectomy,10.1111/papr.12022,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As thyroid surgery is being performed as an ambulatory procedure, recent studies concerning post thyroidectomy analgesia have focused on regional techniques such as bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) and bilateral combined superficial and deep cervical plexus block. But, data regarding the efficacy of BSCPB are controversial. Hence we compared the efficacy of BSCPB with 0.25% bupivacaine with and without clonidine in thyroidectomy, as preventative analgesia. METHODS: Patients (n = 60) undergoing thyroidectomy were randomized into 3 groups (n = 20 each) to receive BSCPB using 15 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine (group B) or 0.25% bupivacaine with 1 mug/kg clonidine (group BC) or 0.9% normal saline (group S) on each side after induction. Intraoperative (fentanyl) and postoperative (morphine) analgesic requirements were assessed. Postoperative pain scores, nausea, vomiting, and sedation were assessed for 24 hours. RESULTS: Intraoperative fentanyl requirement was significantly lesser in groups B and BC (P = 0.012). Postoperative pain scores were significantly lower in group BC (compared to S) at 2 (P = 0.002), 4 (P = 0.016), and 8 (P = 0.012) hours. First analgesic requirement time (min) was significantly higher in groups B and BC (P = 0.002), and postoperative morphine requirement was significantly lower in groups B and BC (P = 0.001). Incidence of postoperative vomiting was significantly reduced in group BC (P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: BSCPB with 0.25% bupivacaine with or without clonidine is effective in reducing both intraoperative and postoperative pain and analgesic requirements in thyroidectomy, and adding clonidine to bupivacaine reduces postoperative vomiting.",eng,1

METHODS: A cLPB consisting of 0.2% ropivacaine was provided from surgery until the following morning. Patients were then randomly assigned either to continue ropivacaine or to be switched to normal saline. Primary endpoints included (1) time to attain three discharge criteria (adequate analgesia, independence from intravenous analgesics, and ambulation > or = 30 m) and (2) ambulatory distance in 6 min the afternoon after surgery. Patients were discharged with their cLPB and a portable infusion pump, and catheters were removed on the fourth postoperative day. RESULTS: Patients given 4 days of perineural ropivacaine (n = 24) attained all three discharge criteria in a median (25th-75th percentiles) of 29 (24-45) h, compared with 51 (42-73) h for those of the control group (n = 23; estimated ratio = 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.92; P = 0.011). Patients assigned to receive ropivacaine ambulated a median of 34 (9-55) m the afternoon after surgery, compared with 20 (6-46) m for those receiving normal saline (estimated ratio = 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-3.0; P = 0.42). Three falls occurred in subjects receiving ropivacaine (13%), versus none in subjects receiving normal saline. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with an overnight cLPB, a 4-day ambulatory cLPB decreases the time to reach three predefined discharge criteria by an estimated 38% after hip arthroplasty. However, the extended infusion did not increase ambulation distance to a statistically significant degree.",eng,1

We sought to examine the effects of intercostal blockade after PCNL versus no intercostals blockade. Methods: 63 patients scheduled to undergo PCNL were enrolled and randomized to either have intercostal blockade with 20 mL of 0.5% bupivicaine with epinephrine (group 1) or 20mL placebo saline solution (group 2). All patients received intravenous narcotic patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. Data was collected on analgesic usage, length of stay, and health-related quality of life (HRQL) as assessed by the Post-operative Recovery Scale (PRS, a modification of the SF-36 that includes visual analog assessments of pain). Data were analyzed with Chi-square, ANOVA, and repeated measures ANCOVA where appropriate according to our pre-planned blinded interim analysis. Results: 63 patients, 38 were male (60.3%), with a mean age of 47.95 (SD=1.46) and mean BMI of 28.14 (SD = 0.62) were enrolled between January, 2004 and April, 2009. There were no differences between the groups at baseline. There was a significant difference in narcotic usage between the two groups (9.3 mg in group 1 vs. 12.1mg in group 2, p =0.03). The HRQL score were significantly higher in group 1 (p = 0.034). There was a trend to less post-operative pain in group 1 (p = 0.058). Conclusion: Intercostal nerve blocks are an easy, safe and inexpensive method to optimize immediate analgesia following PCNL, and may facilitate its use as an outpatient procedure.",English,0

The objective of this randomized study was to compare the quality of analgesia and lung function in 2 groups of patients undergoing pulmonary surgery through a posterolateral thoracotomy. METHODS: Two groups were studied: G1 (n = 16) patients received a 5-segment intercostal block plus IV PCA morphine, and G2 (n = 15) patients received a bupivacaine and fentanyl PCA infusion through a thoracic epidural catheter. Resting and dynamic visual analog pain scale (VAS) measurements, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were measured basally, on arrival in the recovery room, then hourly up to 4 hours and then 12, 24 and 48 hours later. Results were analyzed with a 2-way analysis of variance, chi-square, or Fisher exact test. A p value < or =0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Resting and dynamic VAS scores were slightly lower in G2 patients, although only resting scores were significant. After the first hour, mean scores were below 4 in both groups. No significant difference was observed between groups in relation to respiratory parameters or side effects. CONCLUSION: The fact that the difference in pain scores is probably not clinically significant shows that an intercostal block with bupivacaine plus IV morphine PCA is a good alternative for postthoracotomy pain management.",eng,1

Fifty craniotomy patients were randomly divided into two groups: morphine (morphine 0.1 mg x kg(-1) IV after dural closure and an SNB performed with 20 mL of 0.9% saline at the end of surgery) and block (10 mL of 0.9% saline instead of morphine after dural closure and an SNB performed with a 1:1 mixture of bupivacaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% at the end of surgery). Postoperative pain was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 h using a 10-point numerical rating scale. Analgesia consisted of subcutaneous codeine. Average numerical rating scale scores were similar between the two groups at each time interval. Total codeine dosage was also similar, except at 4 h postoperatively when it was higher in the block group. The delay before administration of the first dose of codeine was not statistically different between groups: 45 min (20-2880) vs 30 min (10-2880), median and range for the block and morphine group, respectively. Postoperative hemodynamics were similar for both groups. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was slightly more frequent in the morphine group, but the occurrence of confusion did not differ between groups. In conclusion, SNB provides a quality of transitional analgesia that is similar to that of morphine with the same postoperative hemodynamic profile.",eng,1

METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-three patients undergoing day-case open inguinal hernia repair with a mesh were randomly allocated to receive either ultrasound-guided TAP block or blind IHN block with levobupivacaine 0.5%, before surgery. Patients were monitored for visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at rest (in the post-anaesthesia care unit, and at 4 and 12 h) and at rest and during movement (at 24, 48 h, 3 and 6 months). Pain at 6 months was also assessed using the DN4 questionnaire for neuropathic pain. RESULTS: Median VAS pain scores at rest were lower in the ultrasound-guided TAP group at 4 h (11 vs 15, P=0.04), at 12 h (20 vs 30, P=0.0014), and at 24 h (29 vs 33, P=0.013).

None of the studies have explored the efficacy of IPLA at emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy (em-LC). A longer operative duration, the greater frequency of washing, and the inflammation associated with cholecystitis or pancreatitis are a few reasons why it cannot be assumed that a benefit in pain scores will be seen in em-LC with IPLA. This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of IPLA in patients undergoing em-LC. METHODS: Double-blind randomized sham controlled trial was conducted of 41 consecutive subjects undergoing em-LC. IPLA was delivered by a combination of injection to the diaphragmatic and topical wash over the liver and gallbladder with bupivacaine or saline. The primary outcome was visual analogue scale pain scores until discharge. Secondary outcomes included pain scores in theatre recovery and analgesic consumption. RESULTS: One patient had a procedure converted to open and was excluded. There was no significant difference in pain scores in the ward or theatre recovery. Analgesic use, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, duration to ambulation, eating, satisfaction scores, and time to discharge were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: IPLA during em-LC does not influence postoperative pain. Other modalities of analgesia should be explored for decreasing the interval between diagnosis of acute admission and em-LC.",eng,0

A retrospective review of a single surgeon and single centre experience of LA block for elective orchidopexy is described for a 9-year period. In the first half of the study, the LA technique was an IIB. An SCB was added to the IIB in the second half using the same total dose of 0.8 ml/kg bupivacaine.

Methods: The study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Seventy-five healthy women were randomized to receive a preoperative infiltration with 0.5% ropivacaine, 0.25% ropivacaine, or saline. Postoperative quality of recovery score (QoR-40), pain, and opioid consumption were assessed up to 24 hours after the surgical procedure. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test. Post hoc pair-wise comparisons were made using Dunn test. P<.05 was required to reject the null hypothesis. Results: Sixty-six patients completed the study. PatientsE baseline characteristics and surgical factors were not different between groups. The ropivacaine group experienced a better quality recovery and less postoperative pain than the saline group. The median difference (99.2% confidence interval) in global recovery scores at 24 hours after surgery was 28 (QoR score 4-39, P=.001) for ropivacaine 0.5% and 28 (QoR score 10-43, P<.001) for ropivacaine 0.25% compared with saline, respectively. The 0.5% ropivacaine group also had less pain, lower opioid consumption, and faster postanesthesia care unit discharge than the saline group. Linear regression demonstrated an inverse relationship between opioid consumption and global quality of recovery at 24 hours (P<.001). Conclusion: The transversus abdominis plane infiltration improves quality of recovery. There was an inverse linear relationship between postoperative opioid consumption and quality of recovery.

Bellamy,2013.0,Does levobupivacaine rectus sheath block improve postoperative analgesia after open gastric bypass surgery?,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bja/aes490,"There are very few data as to the best approach to postoperative analgesia after midline laparotomy for open gastric bypass surgery. Epidural analgesia remains the 'gold standard' for patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery but is technically challenging and frequently impractical in the morbidly obese. Consequently, i.v. morphine via patientcontrolled analgesia (PCA) is the mainstay of postoperative analgesia in this patient population. I.V. morphine is associated with variable analgesia, drowsiness, respiratory depression, and centrally disordered respiratory control. We have therefore performed a randomized controlled trial pilot study to examine whether rectus sheath block before wound closure improves postoperative pain scores and reduces PCA morphine consumption. We performed a prospective, randomized, double/singleblind controlled pilot study in 60 female patients undergoing open gastric bypass using standardized anaesthetic and surgical techniques. The study group Levobupivacaine (chirocaine LA, 20 patients) received local infiltration 0.5% levobupivacaine 40 ml into the rectus abdominis muscle by the surgeon before wound closure; the positive control group (placebo, C+, 20 patients) received an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline infiltration; and the negative control group (control, C+, 20 patients) no infiltration. All received a postoperative loading dose of morphine sulphate of up to 0.1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, morphine PCA, and an induction dose of diclofenac 100 mg. Anthropometric data, morphine usage, and visual analogue pain scores were collected at 0, 1, 4, 12, and 24 h. Visual analogue pain scores (VAS) and morphine use (Fig. 11) were lower in the LA group when compared with the combined control group at multiple (but not all) time points in the postoperative period, the differences disappearing with time. The greatest differences were seen between the LA and C+ groups, with the LA and C2 groups behaving similarly to one another. This study demonstrated an analgesic effect of rectus sheath block against a pooled positive/negative control group, but heterogeneity in the control calls into question whether this was solely due to analgesic benefit of the block or related to increased pain in those receiving saline placebo.

Trovar,2007.0,A randomized trial of bupivicaine pain pumps to eliminate the need for patient controlled analgesia pumps in primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,", ","BACKGROUND: The use of a bupivicaine pain pump has previously been reported to lower costs to hospitals, while providing similar pain relief to opioid-based patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps. However, these benefits have not been investigated in laparoscopic bariatric surgery. METHODS: We prospectively randomized 40 laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) patients into two groups. The first group received the ON-Q bupivicaine pain pump placed subxiphoid and radiating in both directions caudally beneath the lowest rib. The second group was treated with a meperidine PCA, which was initiated in the PACU and discontinued at 06:00 hrs the following morning. Both groups had identical surgery, anesthesiologists, anesthesia protocol and postoperative nausea prophylaxis. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to age, sex, pain scores, nausea scores, gas pain scores, antiemetic use throughout their stay, or opioid use in the PACU. However, there was a dramatic decrease in opioid use between the two groups over the time interval from leaving the PACU to 06:00 hrs (meperidine by PCA mean 217 mg vs ON-Q 129 mg meperidine equivalents, P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a bupivicaine pain pump offers the opportunity to dramatically reduce the use of opioids postoperatively in all bariatric patients by eliminating PCA. This change could potentially reduce the incidence of respiratory failure from oversedation, while offering the same levels of pain control.",eng,0

Group I patients received GA and group II received GA followed by ultrasound-guided TAP block after induction of anaesthesia. Unilateral ultrasound-guided TAP block was achieved with 12 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine. Haemodynamic changes and total dosages of intraoperative analgesics used were recorded intraoperatively. Postoperative pain was assessed using numeric rating score. The total dosages of postoperative analgesics were recorded. Paired student t-test was used to analyze heart rate and blood pressure variations, and Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare analgesic requirement and pain score. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Group II required significantly less amount of fentanyl intraoperatively compared with group I [mean (SD)-75 (12.9) vs 193 (28.1) mug; P > 0.0001]. Postoperative use of meperidine was significantly reduced in group II compared to group I [mean; 7.5 (13.4) vs 46.2 (8) mg; P > 0.0001]. The numeric rating score was significantly lower in group II compared with group I [mean (SD)-0.75 (1.4) vs 5 (1.4)-P > 0.0001]. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided TAP block is an effective method of providing analgesia during the intraoperative and immediate postoperative period for patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery.",English,0

With the midhumeral approach, the four main nerves of the upper extremity can be blocked separately using a peripheral nerve stimulator. The aim of this double-blind study was to block the radial (R) and musculocutaneous (MC) nerves with lidocaine, and the median (M) and ulnar (U) nerves with bupivacaine to recover motor function of the elbow and wrist more rapidly while maintaining long-lasting postoperative analgesia at the operative site. Patients undergoing surgery for Dupuytren's contracture were randomized into two groups in a double-blind fashion: in the control group (n = 17), each of the four nerves was infiltrated with 10 mL of a mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine, whereas in the selective group (n = 17), the R and MC nerves were blocked with 10 mL of 2% lidocaine each and the M and U nerves were blocked with 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine each. Recovery of motor block was significantly faster in the selective group (231 +/- 91 vs 466 +/- 154 min). However, time to first sensation of pain was not different between groups (707 +/- 274 vs 706 +/- 291 min). In conclusion, this new approach at the midhumeral level enables the anesthesiologist to selectively administer local anesthetics on different nerves. IMPLICATIONS: In outpatients undergoing surgery for Dupuytren's contracture, a midhumeral block was used with the musculocutaneous and radial nerves blocked by lidocaine and the median and ulnar nerves blocked with bupivacaine. Recovery of motor function and time to discharge were shorter compared with patients who received the mixture on all four nerves.",eng,0

We compared the analgesic efficacy of two doses of local anesthetic for TAP blocks after cesarean delivery. METHODS: Sixty women having cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were randomized to receive ultrasound-guided TAP blocks using either high-dose ropivacaine (3mg/kg), low-dose ropivacaine (1.5mg/kg) or placebo. Patients received intrathecal 0.75% bupivacaine 10-12mg, fentanyl 10mug and morphine 150mug and standard multimodal analgesia. The primary outcome was the difference in pain with movement using a numeric rating scale at 24h. Other outcomes included time to first request for analgesia, pain scores at 6, 12, 36, 48h and at 6 and 12weeks, opioid consumption, adverse effects, quality of recovery, and satisfaction. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups in the primary outcome. Mean +/- SD pain scores (0-10) with movement at 24h were: high-dose ropivacaine 3.6+/-1.5, low-dose ropivacaine 4.6+/-2.1 and placebo 4.1+/-1.7. With respect to secondary outcomes, the mean +/- SD pain scores at 6h were lower in the high-dose group 2.0+/-1.8 compared to the low-dose 3.4+/-2.7 and placebo groups 4.2+/-2.0 (P=0.009). Pain scores at 12h were also lower in the high-dose group 2.2+/-2.0 compared to the low-dose group 4.1+/-2.7 and placebo group 4.0+/-1.3 (P=0.011). There was no difference in other outcomes between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Neither high- or low-dose TAP blocks as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen including intrathecal morphine improved pain scores with movement at 24h after cesarean delivery when compared to placebo TAP blocks. High-dose TAP blocks may improve pain scores up to 12h after cesarean delivery.",eng,1
Journal Article,R. G. Davies; P. S. Myles; J. M. Graham,2006.0,A comparison of the analgesic efficacy and side-effects of paravertebral vs epidural blockade for thoracotomy--a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials,10.1093/bja/ael020,"Epidural analgesia is considered by many to be the best method of pain relief after major surgery. It is used routinely in many thoracic surgery centres. Although effective, side-effects include hypotension, urinary retention, incomplete (or failed) block, and, in rare cases, paraplegia. Paravertebral block (PVB) is an alternative technique that may offer comparable analgesic effectiveness and a better side-effect profile. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of all relevant randomized trials comparing PVB with epidural analgesia in thoracic surgery. Data were abstracted and verified by both authors. Studies were tested for heterogeneity, and meta-analyses were done with random effects or fixed effects models. Weighted mean difference (WMD) was used for numerical outcomes and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes, both with 95% CI. We identified 10 trials that had enrolled 520 thoracic surgery patients. All of the trials were small (n<130) and none were blinded. There was no significant difference between PVB and epidural groups for pain scores at 4-8, 24 or 48 h, WMD 0.37 (95% CI: -0.5, 121), 0.05 (-0.6, 0.7), -0.04 (-0.4, 0.3), respectively. Pulmonary complications occurred less often with PVB, OR 0.36 (0.14, 0.92). Urinary retention, OR 0.23 (0.10, 0.51), nausea and vomiting, OR 0.47 (0.24, 0.53), and hypotension, OR 0.23 (0.11, 0.48), were less common with PVB. Rates of failed block were lower in the PVB group, OR 0.28 (0.2, 0.6). PVB and epidural analgesia provide comparable pain relief after thoracic surgery, but PVB has a better side-effect profile and is associated with a reduction in pulmonary complications. PVB can be recommended for major thoracic surgery.",eng,1

We have developed a modification of a regional technique called medial open transversus abdominis plane (MOTAP) catheter analgesia. The MOTAP technique involves surgically placed catheters through the open surgical site into a plane between the internal oblique muscle and the transverse abdominis muscle superiorly. The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of this technique. METHODS/DESIGN: This protocol describes a multicentre, prospective, blinded, randomized controlled trial. One hundred and twenty patients scheduled for open liver resection through a subcostal incision will be enrolled. All patients will have two MOTAP catheters placed at the conclusion of surgery. Patients will be randomized to one of two parallel groups: experimental (local anaesthetic through MOTAP catheters) or placebo (normal saline through MOTAP catheters). Both groups will also receive IV PCA. The primary endpoint is mean cumulative postoperative opioid consumption over the first 2 postoperative days (48 hours). Secondary outcomes include pain intensity, patient functional outcomes, and the incidence of complications. DISCUSSION: This trial has been approved by the ethics boards at participating centres and is currently enrolling patients. Data collection will be completed by the end of 2014 with analysis mid-2015 and publication by the end of 2015.

Post-operative pain is less after VATS than after conventional thoracic surgery, but is still significant. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of thoracoscopic, internal intercostal nerve block in alleviating immediate postoperative pain. METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent VATS bilateral sympathectomy for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. The patients were randomly divided into two groups with similar demographic and preoperative physiologic parameters. Group A (n = 16) was submitted to thoracoscopic, internal intercostal nerve blocks performed at T2, T3, and T4 intercostal levels using 3 cc of 0.5% bupivacain in each intercostal space. The injections were performed bilaterally, immediately after the sympathectomy, through the same port. Group B (n = 16) underwent bilateral thoracic sympathectomy without the block. During the immediate postoperative period, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pain score, and analgesic requirements were monitored every 30 minutes. RESULTS: No morbidity was recorded in association with the thoracoscopic, internal intercostal nerve block. The mean heart rates (77 +/- 6 vs 89 +/- 12 beats per minute, p < 0.001), respiratory rates (15 +/- 2 vs 18 +/- 3 respirations per minute, p < 0.01), pain score (1.9 +/- 0.6 vs 2.7 +/- 0.5, p < 0.01), and postoperative analgesic requirements (20 +/- 18 vs 50 +/- 21 mg pethidine HCL, p < 0.001) were significantly lower in group A. There was no significant difference in blood pressures. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracoscopic, internal intercostal nerve block with bupivacain 0.5% during VATS is safe and effectively reduced the immediate postoperative pain and analgesic requirements.",eng,1

Blind TAP block has many complications and uncertainty of its effects. Use of ultrasonography increases the safety and efficacy. This study was conducted to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound (USG)-guided TAP block for retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy (RDN). Methods: In a prospective randomized double-blind study, 60 patients undergoing laparoscopic donor nephrectomy were randomly divided into two groups by closed envelope method. At the end of surgery, USG-guided TAP block was given to the patients of both the groups. Study group (group S) received inj. Bupivacaine (0.375%), whereas control group (group C) received normal saline. Inj. Tramadol (1 mg/kg) was given as rescue analgesic at visual analog scale (VAS) more than 3 in any group at rest or on movement. The analgesic efficacy was judged by VAS both at rest and on movement, time to first dose of rescue analgesic, cumulative dose of tramadol, sedation score, and nausea score, which were also noted at 30 min, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h postoperatively. Total tramadol consumption at 24 h was also assessed. Results: Patients in group S had significantly lower VAS score, longer time to first dose of rescue analgesic (547.13+266.96 min vs. 49.17+24.95 min) and lower tramadol consumption (103.8+32.18 mg vs. 235.8+47.5 mg) in 24 h.

Morgan,2013.0,Randomized clinical trial of intraoperative superficial cervical plexus block versus incisional local anaesthesia in thyroid and parathyroid surgery,10.1002/bjs.9292,"BACKGROUND: Moderate wound pain and opiate analgesia requirement is reported following thyroid and parathyroid surgery. A randomized clinical trial was performed to investigate whether intraoperative superficial cervical plexus block (SCPB) would decrease postoperative pain and analgesia use. METHODS: Patients were randomized to incisional local anaesthesia (control) or incisional local anaesthesia plus intraoperative SCPB. The primary outcome measure was pain, assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures were analgesia use (strong opiates defined as having potency at least as strong as that of oral morphine), respiratory rate and sedation score. Primary outcome measures were analysed with non-parametric tests, as well as with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves calculated as area under the curve (AUC) to discriminate between trial limbs. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were randomized to each group. Pain (VAS) scores were lower in patients who received intraoperative SCPB than in controls 30 min after surgery and subsequently (P < 0.020 at all time points), with a median pain score of zero on the day of operation in the SCPB group. Corresponding analysis of ROC curves showed differences between groups at 30 min (AUC = 0.722, P = 0.012), 90 min (AUC = 0.747, P = 0.005), 150 min (AUC = 0.803, P < 0.001) and 210 min (AUC = 0.849, P < 0.001) after surgery, and at 07.00 hours on postoperative day 1 (AUC = 0.710, P = 0.017). Fewer patients in the SCPB group required strong opiates (5 of 29 versus 16 of 29 in the control group; P = 0.003) and rescue opiates (6 of 29 versus 20 of 29; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative SCPB reduces pain scores following thyroid and parathyroid surgery, and reduces the requirement for strong and rescue opiates.

Gupta,2011.0,The efficacy of a novel approach to transversus abdominis plane block for postoperative analgesia after colorectal surgery,10.1213/ANE.0b013e3182159bf8,"BACKGROUND: The analgesic efficacy of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been established for patients undergoing abdominal surgery. We evaluated the efficacy of a novel approach to TAP block for postoperative analgesia after colorectal surgery. METHODS: Forty adult ASA physical status I to III patients undergoing colorectal surgery were recruited to this double-blind randomized controlled trial. A standard general anesthetic technique was used. TAP block was performed at the end of surgery by piercing the transversus abdominis muscle from inside the abdominal wall at the midaxillary line at the level of the umbilicus with a 22-gauge blunt needle. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mL of 0.25%bupivacaine (TAP group) or normal saline (control group) on each side of the abdominal wall. Each patient was assessed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively for pain at rest and on coughing using a visual analog scale. IV morphine was used for postoperative rescue analgesia. Time to first request for rescue analgesia, total morphine requirement in 24 hours, cumulative morphine consumption at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, and adverse effects (respiratory depression, sedation, nausea/vomiting) were recorded. RESULTS: A 65% decrease in 24-hour total morphine consumption was observed in the TAP group compared with the control group (P < 0.0001). The cumulative morphine requirement was also significantly lower in the TAP group at all time points. Although the time to first request for morphine was comparable, the subsequent doses of morphine were required at significantly longer time intervals in the TAP group than in the control group. TAP group patients had significantly lower pain scores at rest and on coughing as compared with the control group, at all time points assessed. The incidence of sedation was also less in the TAP group at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postoperatively (P < 0.05).

Methods: Patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery at a single centre were randomised to receive either bilateral TAP blocks (ultrasound-guided TAP infiltration with 2 mg/kg L-bupivacaine up to a maximum dose of 150 mg); or the control (no TAP block). The blocks were administered prior to surgery after the induction of a standardised anaesthetic by an anaesthetist who was otherwise uninvolved with the case. The patient, anaesthetist, surgeon and ward staff were blinded to treatment allocation. All patients received post-operative analgesia with paracetamol and a morphine PCA. Cumulative opioid consumption and pain scores were recorded at 2, 4, 6 and 24 h post-operatively and compared between the two groups using an intention-to-treat analysis of the patients converted to open surgery. Results: The intervention, TAP block group (n = 33) and control group (n = 35) were comparable for demographics, specimen pathology and type of procedure. Seven patients (2 of the TAP block group and 5 of the control group) were converted to open surgery. The TAP block groups cumulative morphine usage was significantly less than the control groups (no TAP block) with their median morphine usage at 2 h post-operatively 13 mg (Inter-quartile range [IQR] 11-16 mg) versus 18 mg (IQR 12-26 mg) p<0.01; at 4 h post-operatively 16 mg (IQR 14-26 mg) versus 26 mg (IQR 17-31 mg) p = 0.02; at 6 h post-operatively 20 mg (IQR 15-29 mg) versus 32 mg (IQR 21-46 mg) p = 0.01 and at 24 h post-operatively 40 mg (IQR 25-63 mg) versus 60 mg (IQR 39-81 mg) p = 0.04, respectively.

Pridun,2002.0,Is intercostal block for pain management in thoracic surgery more successful than epidural anaesthesia?,", http://ejcts.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/1115.full.pdf","OBJECTIVE: Currently epidural anesthesia is the gold standard for postoperative pain management in thoracic surgery. In a prospective randomised study, the effect of an intercostal nerve block applied at the end of the operation was compared to that of epidural anesthesia. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing thoracotomy were randomised to each group. Patients with resection of the parietal pleura, rib resection and rethoracotomy were excluded from the study. Both groups received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs every 8h as a baseline analgesic medication and were allowed to ask for supplemental subcutaneous opiate injection, limited to four injections per day. The patients in the epidural catheter group (group I) were provided with a motor pump allowing continuous infusion of bupivacain 0.125% and 2mg fentanyl/ml at a dosage of 6-10 ml per hour, dependent on the pain level over a period of 5 days. The patients of the second group (group II) received an intercostal nerve block at the end of the operation reaching from the third to the ninth intercostal space with 20 ml 0.5% bubivacaine. Pain was evaluated with a pain score ranging from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) twice daily in relaxed position and during physical activity like coughing. On the fifth postoperative day, the patients were asked specific questions concerning the subjective pain experience. Costs of both treatments were calculated. Mean pain values and costs of both groups were compared by t-tests for independent samples. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Eighteen male and 12 female patients, aged between 35 and 71 years (mean 59) were included in the study. Nineteen patients had lobectomy, five bilobectomy, two decortication and three wedge resection. There were 22 right sided and eight left sided procedures. In group I, the mean pain score on the operation day was 3.95 in relaxed position and 6.33 during physical activity like coughing. The mean pain score during the following 4 days was 2.19 in relaxed position and 4.28 with activity. Three patients required additional subcutaneous opiate injection. In group II, the mean score on the operation day was 2.0 in relaxed position and 3.5 during activity. The mean pain score during the next 4 days was 2.84 in relaxed position and 5.65 with activity. Twelve patients received subcutaneous opiates. In both groups, no complications were observed. COSTS: The costs for treatment of one patient was 105 in group I and 33 in group II. Patients' satisfaction was equal in both groups, there were no differences in terms of outcome and recovery. CONCLUSION: Pain management by intercostal block was superior during the first 24h after surgery whereas on the second day after surgery pain control was significantly better achieved by the epidural catheter in relaxed position. A combination of both forms of anaesthesia seems to be an ideal pain management in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.",eng,1

DESIGN: Meta-analysis. SETTING: District general hospital. PATIENTS: 86 patients in the TAP block group and 88 in the non-TAP block group. MEASUREMENTS: Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2007 for Windows XP. Hedges g statistic was used for the calculation of standardized mean differences (SMD). Binary data (nausea) were summarized as risk ratios (RR). MAIN RESULTS: Patients with TAP block required less morphine after 24 hours than those who did not have the block (random effects model: SMD -4.81, 95% CI [-7.45, -2.17], z = -3.57, P < 0.001). There was less time to first request of morphine in the non-TAP block group (random effects model: SMD 4.80, 95% CI [2.16, 7.43], z = 3.57, P < 0.001). Patients in the TAP block group had less pain up to 24 hours postoperatively. No statistical differences were found with respect to nausea. CONCLUSIONS: TAP block reduces the need for postoperative opioid use, it increases the time first request for further analgesia, it provides more effective pain relief, and it reduces opioid-associated side effects.",eng,1

Chelly,2014.0,Is L2 paravertebral block comparable to lumbar plexus block for postoperative analgesia after total hip arthroplasty?,10.1007/s11999-013-3393-9,"BACKGROUND: Continuous lumbar plexus block (LPB) is a well-accepted technique for regional analgesia after THA. However, many patients experience considerable quadriceps motor weakness with this technique, thus impairing their ability to achieve their physical therapy goals. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether L2 paravertebral block (PVB) provides better postoperative analgesia (defined as decreased postoperative opioid consumption and lower pain scores), better preservation of motor function, and decreased length of hospital stay (LOS) compared to LPB in patients undergoing THA. METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing minimally invasive THA under standardized spinal anesthesia were enrolled in this randomized controlled study. After exclusions, 53 patients were randomized into the L2 PVB (n = 27) and LPB (n = 26) groups. Patient-controlled analgesia was available for 24 hours. Motor and pain assessments were performed in the recovery room and at the end of 24 hours. LOS was also noted. RESULTS: Postoperative opioid consumption during the first 24 hours was less in the LPB group (mean +/- SD: 24 +/- 15 mg morphine) than in the L2 PVB group (32 +/- 15 mg morphine; p = 0.005); however, postoperative pain scores were not different between groups. Postoperative motor and rehabilitation outcomes and LOS were also similar. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that use of a LPB results in slightly less morphine consumption but comparable pain scores when compared with continuous L2 PVB. No difference was noted in terms of motor preservation or LOS. Although the difference in morphine consumption was only slightly in favor of the LPB group, the advantage of L2 PVBs noted by previous authors as preservation of motor function, was not seen. At our institute where LPBs have been performed for years, there seems to be no real advantage in switching to L2 PVBs. However, L2 PVB could be a reasonable alternative for operators who are wary of LPBs due to their high potential for complications and/or requiring advanced skills for its placement. But, since L2 PVBs are relatively new, not much is known about their complication profile. We recommend a thorough understanding of both techniques before attempting to place them.

Perez,2008.0,Psoas compartment block for lower extremity surgery: a meta-analysis,10.1093/bja/aen298,"Psoas compartment block (PCB) is a potentially useful but controversial technique for lower limb surgery. We have conducted a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of PCB for anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia for hip and knee surgery. Relevant studies were identified within PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. The main outcome measure for anaesthesia was anaesthetic efficacy. For postoperative analgesia, the severity of postoperative pain was compared. The data were subjected to meta-analysis using relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous variables and weighted mean differences with 95% CI for continuous variables. Thirty publications were included. PCB is an effective intervention for analgesia after hip and knee surgery. It appears superior to opioids for pain relief after hip surgery. This analgesic benefit may be extended beyond 8 h by the use of a catheter technique. Compared with Winnie's 3-in-1 block, PCB is associated with more consistent block of the obturator nerve. PCB may be an alternative to postoperative neuraxial block. Although PCB combined with sciatic nerve block and sedation is an effective technique for minor knee surgery, there is currently insufficient data to recommend the use of this approach for hip and major knee surgery. PCB is a safe and effective alternative for analgesia after hip and knee surgery. More research is required to define its role in the intraoperative setting and confirm potentially beneficial effects on variables such as perioperative haemodynamics and blood loss.",eng,1

Pusic,2005.0,The role of methocarbamol and intercostal nerve blocks for pain management in breast augmentation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asj.2005.09.003,"Background: Breast augmentation is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures performed in the United States. The optimal approach to postoperative pain management has yet to be determined. Objective: T he objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of intercostal nerve blocks and oral methocarbamol for postoperative pain control. Method: One hundred primary breast augmentation patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups: (1) methocarbamol given with intercostal blocks, (2) methocarbamol given without intercostal blocks, (3) no methocarbamol given with intercostal blocks, and (4) no methocarbamol or intercostal blocks given. The patients and recovery room nurses were strictly blinded to treatment group assignment. Results: All patients underwent primary augmentation with no other procedures performed. Patients who received intercostal nerve blocks required the same amounts of postoperative narcotics as those who did not receive blocks. Their mean visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores also did not differ significantly from those who received blocks. Patients who received preoperative methocarbamol had significantly lower VAS pain scores in the first hours after surgery than did those who did not receive the drug (P = 0.03). Conclusions: This study suggests that intercostal nerve blocks do not significantly decrease postoperative pain following breast augmentation. Preoperative use of methocarbamol may be of benefit to help diminish early perioperative pain. In this outpatient cosmetic surgery population, expeditious pain management with minimization of nausea and sedation is critical. A preoperative dose of methocarbamol may be of benefit and merits further investigation. Copyright 2005 by The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Inc.",English,1

We wanted to test if preoperative inguinal field block (IFB) with ropivacaine would provide benefits in the postoperative period compared with general anesthesia and wound infiltration. METHODS: Sixty patients scheduled for inguinal hernia repair were randomized to receive general anesthesia with wound infiltration postoperatively, or inguinal field block (IFB) before surgery, with no or only light sedation intraoperatively. General anesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl and propofol, maintained with propofol and alfentanil, and supplemented with nitrous oxide in oxygen through a laryngeal mask. The IFB was performed by an anesthesiologist, with 50-60 ml ropivacaine and 5 mg/ml with a dedicated technique. RESULTS: All significant differences were in favor of the IFB group: less pain (visual analog scale, verbal pain score) postoperatively and until day 7, faster mobilization with less pain, lower analgesic consumption, and higher patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Preoperative inguinal field block for hernia repair provides benefits for patients in terms of faster recovery, less pain, better mobilization and higher satisfaction throughout the whole first postoperative week.",eng,1

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, and double-blinded study. SETTING: A university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty patients undergoing thoracic surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received paravertebral catheterization and a bolus (14-20 mL) of 0.5% bupivacaine (n = 20) or 0.5% levobupivacaine (n = 20) with morphine, 60 [mu]g/kg, before the induction of general anesthesia that consisted of a propofol infusion. A paravertebral continuous infusion (0.05 mL/kg/h) of 0.25% bupivacaine or 0.25% levobupivacaine, 100 mL, with added morphine, 10 mg, and clonidine, 0.15 mg, was started at the end of surgery for 72 hours postoperatively.

Infusion was started before closing the chest and was continued for 5 days. Subjective pain relief was assessed on a linear visual analogue scale. Pulmonary function was measured on the day before operation and daily for 5 days. There were 29 patients in a group which received bupivacaine and 27 in a control group which received saline. The bupivacaine group had lower pain scores (P less than 0.01) and required less papaveretum (P less than 0.01) than the control group. Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and peak expiratory flow rate were maximally reduced at 24 h to median values of 56, 60 and 57 per cent, respectively, of preoperative control values in the bupivacaine group, and to 25, 30 and 32 per cent in the control group. These differences are highly significant (P less than 0.01). Restoration of pulmonary function was superior in the bupivacaine group (P less than 0.01). There were no infusion-related complications. After thoracotomy, continuous intercostal blockade with bupivacaine is a safe and effective method of pain relief which reduces the early loss of postoperative pulmonary function significantly and more rapidly restores respiratory mechanics.",eng,1

In the same patients (n = 60), a 1-yr follow-up was performed to find out whether PVB could also reduce the prevalence of postoperative chronic pain. The follow-up consisted of a 14-day symptom diary and telephone interviews 1, 6, and 12 mo after surgery. The 14-day consumption of analgesics was similar in the 30 PVB and the 30 control patients. However, 1 mo after surgery, the intensity of motion-related pain was lower (P = 0.005) in the PVB group. Six months after surgery, the prevalence of any pain symptoms (P = 0.029) was lower in the PVB group. Finally, at 12 mo after surgery, in addition to the prevalence of pain symptoms (P = 0.003) and the intensity of motion-related pain (P = 0.003), the intensity of pain at rest (P = 0.011) was lower in the PVB group. These findings were independent of whether or not axillary dissection had been performed.

We compared regional anaesthesia vs conventional analgesia for the prevention of persistent postoperative pain (PPP). METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from their inception to May 2012, limiting the results to randomized, controlled, clinical trials (RCTs), supplemented by a hand search in conference proceedings. We included RCTs comparing regional vs conventional analgesia with a pain outcome at 6 or 12 months. The two authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data. We report odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as our summary statistic based on random-effects models. We grouped studies according to surgical interventions. RESULTS: We identified 23 RCTs. We pooled data from 250 participants in three trials after thoracotomy with outcomes at 6 months. Data favoured epidural anaesthesia for the prevention of PPP with an OR of 0.33 (95% CI 0.20-0.56). We pooled two studies investigating paravertebral block for breast cancer surgery; pooled data of 89 participants with outcomes approximately 6 months favoured paravertebral block with an OR of 0.37 (95% CI 0.14-0.94). Adverse effects were reported sparsely. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural anaesthesia and paravertebral block, respectively, may prevent PPP after thoracotomy and breast cancer surgery in about one out of every four to five patients treated.

Methods: Forty healthy male newborns were assigned randomly to receive either ring block or no anesthesia. Indices of perceived pain including crying time, behavioral state, oxygen saturation, and heart and respiratory rates were recorded at baseline and at intervals during the circumcision. Infants were reassessed 2 minutes and 2 hours postoperatively. Results: Infants receiving ring block cried less than did controls (P < .001). Anesthetized infants had smaller increases in heart rate (P < .005) and demonstrated less arousal (P < .005) during each operative interval. For all operative intervals combined, anesthetized infants had a smaller decrease in oxygen saturation (P < .001) and a smaller increase in respiratory rate (P = .005) than did controls. Two minutes postoperatively, anesthetized infants had returned to their baseline behavioral state, whereas controls remained significantly more aroused (P < .005). Two hours postoperatively, there were no significant differences in any variables between the groups, nor between each group and its baseline. There were no complications related to anesthesia administration. Conclusion: Neonatal circumcision causes behavioral and physiologic changes consistent with the perception of pain.

We performed this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of nerve stimulator-guided unilateral pudendal nerve block for pain relief after episiotomy. METHODS: Forty women who gave birth vaginally with mediolateral episiotomy were randomized to receive pudendal nerve block with 15 mL of either ropivacaine 7.5 mg/mL (pudendal group) or normal saline (control group) after repair of the episiotomy. Episiotomy pain was assessed with a visual analog scale at rest at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postepisiotomy and during activities (walking and sitting). Breakthrough pain (visual analog scale >30 mm) was treated with niflumic acid suppositories 700 mg every 12 h. The primary outcome variables were pain scores at rest and during activities over 48 h postpartum. RESULTS: Demographic and obstetric characteristics were not different between groups. Successful pudendal nerve stimulation was achieved in all patients.

METHODS: After random allocation, 93 children aged 7-16 were randomized to receive ultrasound-guided TAP blocks placed before surgery or not (control). All subjects had port sites infiltrated with ropivacaine and were prescribed i.v. patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine and oral paracetamol for postoperative pain. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects using >200 microg kg(-1) morphine. Secondary outcomes included PCA morphine use, pain scores, time intervals to the first use of PCA and other analgesics, sedation scores, postoperative nausea or vomiting, and time to hospital discharge. RESULTS: The procedure duration was longer in the TAP group (111 compared with 97 min for controls, P=0.03). The duration in the recovery ward and that of the hospital stay were similar. There was no difference in the proportion of subjects requiring >200 microg kg(-1) of PCA morphine [control 31/45 (69%), TAP 29/42 (69%), P=0.99].

Basu,2011.0,Paravertebral block can be an alternative to unilateral spinal anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair,10.4103/0019-5049.90613,"BACKGROUND: Inguinal hernia repair can be performed under satisfactory anaesthetic conditions using general, regional and peripheral nerve block anaesthesia. Unilateral spinal anaesthesia provides optimal anaesthesia, with stable haemodynamics and minimal adverse events. The paravertebral block, being segmental in nature, can be expected to produce some advantages regarding haemodynamic stability and early ambulation and may be a viable alternative. METHODS: Fifty-four consenting male patients posted for inguinal hernia repair were randomized into two groups, to receive either the two-segment paravertebral block (group-P, n=26) at T10 and L1 or unilateral spinal anaesthesia (group-S, n=28), respectively. The time to ambulation (primary outcome), time to the first analgesic, total rescue analgesic consumption in the first 24-hour period and adverse events were noted. RESULTS: Block performance time and time to reach surgical anaesthesia were significantly higher in the patients of group-P (P<0.001). Time to ambulation was significantly shorter in group-P compared to group-S (P<0.001), while postoperative sensory block was prolonged in patients of group-S; P<0.001. A significantly higher number of patients could bypass the recovery room in group-P compared to group-S, (45% versus 0%, respectively, P<0.001). No statistically significant difference in adverse outcomes was recorded. CONCLUSION: Both the paravertebral block and unilateral spinal anaesthesia are effective anaesthetic techniques for uncomplicated inguinal hernia repair. However, the paravertebral block can be an attractive alternative as it provides early ambulation and prolonged postoperative analgesia with minimal adverse events.",eng,0

Subjects and methods This randomized controlled trial involved 108 children, 3-7 years old, randomly allocated into one of two equal groups; TAP Group and Control Group. All children received general anesthesia using propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg, atracurium 0.5 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 mug/kg. TAP Group received 0.5 ml/kg of ropivacaine 0.375% bilaterally under ultrasound guidance and control group received regular analgesics. Quality of analgesia was assessed using Children's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) and Objective behavioral pain score (OPS). The primary outcome measures were hemodynamic parameters and degree of pain. Secondary outcome measures were intraoperative fentanyl requirement, postoperative rescue analgesia (time and dose), complications, hospital stay and degree of satisfaction of patients and their parents. Results TAP block group had significantly lower intraoperative fentanyl dose (p < 0.001), significantly longer time to first postoperative request of analgesic (p < 0.001), lower analgesic dose during the first postoperative 24 h (p < 0.001) and lower pain scores along the whole 24 postoperative hours. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were within the clinically accepted range in the two groups. Parents' satisfaction was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the TAP block group. Conclusion TAP block under ultrasound guidance was easy, safe, reliable and effective analgesic in children undergoing laparoscopic surgery for undescended testis. 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.",English,1

Dahl,2013.0,Transversus abdominis plane block or subcutaneous wound infiltration after open radical prostatectomy: a randomized study,10.1111/aas.12080,"BACKGROUND: Open radical retropubic prostatectomy (ORRP) is associated with moderate pain. We hypothesized that a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block would reduce post-operative pain, morphine consumption and opioid-related side effects compared with wound infiltration and placebo in this population. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study. The operations were performed with patients in general anaesthesia. Patients were allocated to receive either bilateral TAP block (n = 23), wound infiltration (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). Treatment was 40 ml ropivacaine 0.75% and placebo was 40 ml saline 0.9%. Pre-operatively, all patients received oral gabapentin, ibuprofen and paracetamol, followed by oral paracetamol and ibuprofen at regular doses and intervals, and patient-controlled analgesia with IV morphine from 0 h to 24 h post-operatively. RESULTS: Visual analogue scale pain score during mobilization 4 h post-operatively (primary outcome) did not differ significantly between the TAP block and placebo group (TAP 28 +/- 22 mm vs. placebo 33 +/- 18 mm, P = 0.64). Pain scores (as area under the curve) during the first 24 h were not significantly different among any of the three groups, neither at rest nor during mobilization. Morphine consumption (0-24 h) did not differ significantly between groups {TAP block = 15 [8-23] mg, infiltration 15 [8-36] mg, placebo 15 [3-30] mg, [median (interquartile range)]}. Levels of nausea, sedation and number of vomits were not different among the groups. CONCLUSION: Neither TAP block nor wound infiltration with ropivacaine improved a basic multimodal analgesic regimen with paracetamol, ibuprofen and gabapentin after ORRP.",eng,1

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intraoperative intercostals neural blockade for the control of postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: In a prospective, double-blinded, clinical trial, 61 patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) 1 and 2 undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to receive only general anesthesia (control group, n = 30) or general anesthesia plus intraoperative intercostals neural blockade using 0.5% bupivacaine-adrenaline at the right side (intercostals group, n = 31). Postoperative pain was assessed according to a pain severity score using a subjective analog visual scale (VAS) 6, 12, and 24 h after the surgery. Systemic narcotic injection was available to all surgically treated patients postoperatively according to their demand. The history, pain severity score, and all postoperative data were recorded for each patient. RESULTS: The pain severity score was significantly higher in control group than in the intercostals group (p < 0.001), suggesting that patients who received intercostals neural blockade had less pain postoperatively than the control group. CONCLUSION: Intercostals neural blockade may safely be used to reduce the postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",eng,1

Dine,2003.0,"Improved pain control after cardiac surgery: results of a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial",10.1016/s0022,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether a continuous regional infusion of a local anesthetic delivered to the operative site would result in decreased levels of postoperative pain and narcotic requirements for patients who undergo a standard median sternotomy for cardiac surgery. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at a single center. Patients who were undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery alone or combined with laser transmyocardial revascularization received bilateral intercostal nerve blocks with either ropivacaine or saline. At wound closure, 2 catheters with multiple side openings were inserted percutaneously and placed directly over the sternum. The same agent (ropivacaine vs saline) was then administered as a continuous regional infusion for 48 hours through an elastomeric pump. Requirements for postoperative systemic narcotic analgesics and pain assessment scores were recorded for 72 hours after the operation. Secondary outcome measures were hospital length of stay and pulmonary function test results. Pain scores and narcotic use on the second postoperative day were also compared to avoid the confounding influence of anesthesia administered at the time of the operation. RESULTS: The total amount of narcotic analgesia required by the ropivacaine group was significantly less than that of the control group (47.3 vs 78.7 mg, respectively; P =.038). The ropivacaine group required less narcotics on postoperative day 2 as well (15.5 vs 29.4 mg, P =.025). The mean overall pain scores for the ropivacaine group were significantly less than the mean overall scores for the normal saline group (1.6 vs 2.6, respectively; P =.005). Patients receiving ropivacaine had a mean length of stay of 5.2 days compared with 8.2 days for patients in the normal saline group (P =.001). Excluding the data from outliers (length of stay = 39 days), the normal saline group mean length of stay was 6.3 days (P <.01). There was no difference in assessment of pulmonary function. CONCLUSION: Continuous delivery of local anesthetics significantly improved postoperative pain control while decreasing the amount of narcotic analgesia required in patients who underwent standard median sternotomy. There was also a significant decrease in hospital length of stay, which is likely to result in significant cost reductions.",eng,1

METHODS: Sixty ASA I-III patients scheduled for elective unilateral MRM under general anesthesia were included. They were randomly allocated into two groups: group 1 (n = 30), single-injection ipsilateral interscalene brachial plexus block; group 2 (n = 30), control group. Postoperative analgesia was provided with IV PCA morphine during 24 h postoperatively. Pain intensity was assessed with the visual analogue scale (VAS). Morphine consumption, side effects of opioid, antiemetic requirement, and complications associated with interscalene block were recorded. RESULTS: VAS scores were significantly lower in group 1, except in the first postoperative 24 h (p < 0.007). The patients without block consumed more morphine [group 1, 5 (0-40) mg; group 2, 22 (6-48) mg; p = 0.001]. Rescue morphine requirements were also higher in the postoperative first hour in group 2 (p = 0.001). Nausea and antiemetic requirements were significantly higher in group 2 (p = 0.03 and 0.018). Urinary retention was observed in 1 patient in group 2 and signs of Horner's syndrome in 2 patients in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal method has not been defined yet for acute pain palliation after MRM. Our study demonstrated that the use of interscalene block in patients undergoing MRM improved pain scores and reduced morphine consumption during the first 24 h postoperatively. The block can be a good alternative to other invasive regional block techniques used for postoperative pain management after MRM.",eng,1

Incorporating long-acting pain relief from a continuous peripheral nerve block, with a reliable method of catheter insertion, and a self-contained infusion system would be a valuable asset for short-stay care. We compared the efficacy of single injection interscalene brachial plexus blockade to a continuous peripheral nerve block, with an insulated Tuohy system and a disposable infusion pump. Forty adult patients scheduled for open rotator cuff repair were entered in this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Patients received an interscalene brachial plexus blockade and a continuous peripheral nerve catheter as their primary anesthetic and then, were assigned to receive one of two different postoperative infusions: either 0.2% ropivacaine at 10 mL/h via a disposable infusion pump or normal saline at 10 mL/h via a disposable infusion pump (n = 18-20 per group). Visual analog pain scores and postoperative morphine consumption were measured for 24 h. The ropivacaine group showed less pain than the placebo group (P: = 0.0001) between 12 and 24 h after the initial injection of local anesthetic. In addition, initial interscalene blockade was successful in all patients and all redosed catheters were functional after 24 h with the continuous catheter insertion system. We conclude that it is possible to achieve a high rate of successful catheter placement and analgesia by using the continuous catheter insertion system and a disposable infusion pump in the ambulatory setting. This method of analgesia may offer improved pain relief after outpatient rotator cuff repair.",eng,0

The aim of the present quantitative systematic review was to assess the efficacy and adverse events of PVB in women undergoing breast surgery. METHODS: The systematic search, data extraction, critical appraisal, and pooled analysis were performed according to the PRISMA statement. The relative risk (RR), mean difference (MD), and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the RevMan statistical software for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively. Pain scores were converted to a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). RESULTS: Fifteen randomized controlled trials (published between 1999 and 2009) including 877 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was a significant difference in worst postoperative pain scores between PVB and general anaesthesia (GA) at <2 h (MD: -2.68; 95% CI: -3.33 to -2.02; P<0.00001), 2-24 h (MD: -2.34; 95% CI: -2.42 to -1.12; P<0.00001), and 24-48 h (MD: -1.75; 95% CI: -3.19 to 0.31; P=0.02). Accordingly, lower pain scores were observed for combined PVB with GA compared with GA alone for <2 h (MD: -1.87; 95% CI: -2.53 to -1.21; P<0.00001), 2-24 h (MD: -2.21; 95% CI: -3.07 to -1.35; P<0.00001), and 24-48 h (MD: -1.80; 95% CI: -2.92 to 0.68; P=0.002). The RR for the reported adverse events (e.g. pneumothorax) was low. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable evidence that PVB in addition to GA or alone provide a better postoperative pain control with little adverse effects compared with other analgesic treatment strategies.",eng,1

METHODS: Forty patients undergoing elective lobectomy were randomly, but equally, placed into two groups. An intrapleural catheter was inserted under direct vision during surgery. Group I received intrapleural 40 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine, group II was administered 40 mL of saline solution as a control group. Diclofenac sodium was administered as an additional analgesic, if required. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS), and Prince Henry pain scale. Arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate, and systemic arterial pressures were monitored. All observations were recorded 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after the injection, and thereafter at hourly intervals through the postoperative 24 hours. RESULTS: The mean analgesia times were 5 hours and 2 hours in group I and group II, respectively. Therefore, bupivacaine administrations were repeated every 6 hours in group I, and saline with additional analgesic were administered every 4 hours in group II. The heart rate and arterial pressures did not show a significant difference. While the additional analgesic requirement was 180 +/- 10 mg/d in group II, there was no need for additional analgesic administration in the group I patients. Arterial oxygen was significantly higher in group I than in group II. Arterial carbon dioxide tension of group II was significantly higher than that of group I. While the postoperative atelectasis and pneumonia developed in four patients and one, respectively, in group II, no such complication was observed in group I. CONCLUSIONS: The easy placement of an intrapleural catheter and better pain relief observed in the present study suggest that intermittent pleural infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine has proven to be a safe and effective method for relief of post-thoracotomy pain.",eng,1

Wong,2009.0,Analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block in patients undergoing open appendicectomy,10.1093/bja/aep175,"BACKGROUND: Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a new regional anaesthetic technique that blocks abdominal neural afferents by introducing local anaesthetic into the neuro-fascial plane between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles. We evaluated its analgesic efficacy in patients undergoing open appendicectomy in a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial. METHODS: Fifty-two adult patients undergoing open appendicectomy were randomized to undergo standard care (n=26) or to undergo a right-sided TAP block with bupivacaine (n=26). In addition, all patients received patient-controlled i.v. morphine analgesia, regular acetaminophen, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, as required, in the postoperative period. All patients received standard anaesthetic, and after induction of anaesthesia, the TAP group received an ultrasound-guided unilateral TAP block. Each patient was assessed after operation by a blinded investigator at 30 min and 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: Ultrasound-guided TAP block significantly reduced postoperative morphine consumption in the first 24 h [mean (sd) 28 (18) vs 50 (19) mg, P<0.002]. Postoperative visual analogue scale pain scores were also reduced in the TAP block group soon after surgery [median (IQR) 4.5 (3-5.3) vs 8.5 (7.5-10), P<0.001] and at 24 h [5.2 (4-6.2) vs 8 (7-8.5), P<0.001]. There were no complications attributable to the TAP block. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided TAP block holds considerable promise as a part of a balanced postoperative analgesic regimen for patients undergoing open appendicectomy.",eng,1

We designed this study to compare the analgesic effect of IINBs placed before or after cesarean delivery. Forty-six patients undergoing cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Before, After, or None. Bilateral IINBs were placed with 0.5% bupivacaine, 10 mL to each side. Twenty-two patients had IINBs placed before surgery (11 failed blocks), 12 had blocks placed after surgery, and 12 had no block.

Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate whether better perioperative pain management could positively influence postoperative shoulder function. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, 3 groups of patients--each with 15 participants--were treated with SSN block (10 mL of 1% ropivacaine), placebo, or a subacromial infiltration of local anesthesia (20 mL of 1% ropivacaine). Preoperative and postoperative pain was evaluated with a visual analog scale. Functional outcome was measured by the Constant-Murley score, and patient satisfaction was measured anecdotally by interview 2 days, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: The SSN group reported significantly lower levels of postoperative pain, required significantly less analgesia, had better range of motion, and had higher levels of postoperative satisfaction in comparison to the subacromial infiltration group and placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with SSN blocks had less pain overall, which led to a decreased need for analgesics in comparison to the subacromial infiltration and placebo groups.

Recently, the transverse abdominis plane block has been proposed to compensate for the problems developed by preexisting methods. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of the ultrasound-guided transverse abdominis plane block (US-TAP block) and compare efficacy according to the concentration of local analgesics in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: Fifty-four patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized into three groups. The patients in Group Control did not receive the US-TAP block. The patients in Group B(0.25) and Group B(0.5) received the US-TAP block with 0.25% and 0.5% levobupivacaine 30 ml respectively. After the general anesthesia, a bilateral US-TAP block was performed using an in-plane technique with 15 ml levobupivacaine on each side. Intraoperative use of remifentanil and postoperative demand of rescue analgesics in PACU were recorded. The postoperative verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was evaluated at 20, 30, and 60 min, and 6, 12, and 24 hr. Postoperative complications, including pneumoperitoneum, bleeding, infection, and sleep disturbance, were also checked. RESULTS: The intraoperative use of remifentanil, postoperative VNRS and the postoperative demand of rescue analgesics were lower in the groups receiving the US-TAP block (Group B(0.25) and Group B(0.5)) than Group Control. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between Group B(0.25) and Group B(0.5). No complications related to the US-TAP block were observed.

We hypothesised that the ACB would reduce pain and analgesic requirements after minor arthroscopic knee surgery. Methods Seventy-two patients scheduled for minor knee surgery were enrolled in this placebo-controlled, blinded trial. The patients were randomised to receive an ACB with either 30 ml ropivacaine 7.5 mg/ml (n = 36) or saline (n = 35) in addition to a basic analgesic regimen with paracetamol and ibuprofen. Primary outcome measure was pain during standing at 2 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes were pain at rest, while standing and after a 5-m walk; opioid consumption and opioid-related side effects 0-24 h after surgery. Results Pain scores {median [interquartile range (IQR)]}, regarding primary outcome were 15 (0-26) mm in the ropivacaine vs. 17 (5-28) mm in the control group, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-10 to 4) mm, P = 0.41. Ketobemidone consumption 0-2 h post-operatively [median (IQR)] was lower in the ropivacaine vs. The control group: 0.0 (0.0-2.5) mg vs. 2.5 (0.0-5.0) mg, 95% CI: -2.5 to 0 mg, P = 0.01. No differences were observed for any other outcome. Conclusion No significant analgesic effect of the ACB could be detected after minor arthroscopic knee surgery with a basic analgesic regimen with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, except from a minor reduction in immediate requirements for supplemental opioids.

Elshmaa,2012.0,Pre-emptive analgesia by nerve stimulator guided pudendal nerve block for posterior colpoperineorrhaphy,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2012.03.032,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of pre-emptive analgesia by bilateral nerve stimulator-guided pudendal nerve block (PNB) on pain intensity and consumption of analgesics following posterior colpoperineorrhaphy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized observer-blinded study. The study included 130 patients who were scheduled to undergo posterior colpoperineorrhaphy under general anesthesia (GA). They were invited to enroll in the study during the period from October 2009 to August 2011 at TAIBA Hospital in Kuwait. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups of 65 patients each: GA alone or GA combined with pre-emptive nerve stimulator-guided PNB with 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine in each side. The primary outcome measures were VAS pain scores and postoperative analgesic consumption. RESULTS: Postoperative average VAS pain scores, IM pethidine consumption and IV paracetamol consumption during the first 24 h; were highly significantly lower in the PNB group compared to the GA alone group. This technique was also associated with a significantly higher overall patient satisfaction compared to GA alone, without obvious side effects. CONCLUSION: Pre-emptive analgesia by bilateral nerve stimulator-guided PNB is a simple and useful technique that when combined with GA was found to substantially reduce postoperative pain and consumption of analgesics during the first 24 h postoperatively, and shorten the time to return to normal activities compared to GA alone for patients undergoing posterior colpoperineorrhaphy. The use of PNB was also associated with a high overall patient satisfaction. Thus, the results of the present study may recommend the use of nerve stimulator-guided PNB in posterior colpoperineorrhaphy patients.",eng,1

We evaluated its analgesic efficacy in patients during the first 24 postoperative hours after abdominal surgery, in a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. METHODS: Thirty-two adults undergoing large bowel resection via a midline abdominal incision were randomized to receive standard care, including patient-controlled morphine analgesia and regular nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and acetaminophen (n = 16), or to undergo TAP block (n = 16) in addition to standard care (n = 16). After induction of anesthesia, 20 mL of 0.375% levobupivacaine was deposited into the transversus abdominis neuro-fascial plane via the bilateral lumbar triangles of Petit. Each patient was assessed by a blinded investigator in the postanesthesia care unit and at 2, 4, 6, and 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS: The TAP block reduced visual analog scale pain scores (TAP versus control, mean +/- sd) on emergence (1 +/- 1.4 vs 6.6 +/- 2.8, P < 0.05), and at all postoperative time points, including at 24 h (1.7 +/- 1.7 vs 3.1 +/- 1.5, P < 0.05). Morphine requirements in the first 24 postoperative hours were also reduced (21.9 +/- 8.9 mg vs 80.4 +/- 19.2 mg, P < 0.05). There were no complications attributable to the TAP block. All TAP patients reported high levels of satisfaction with their postoperative analgesic regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The TAP block provided highly effective postoperative analgesia in the first 24 postoperative hours after major abdominal surgery.",eng,1

METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, adult patients scheduled for thyroid surgery under general anaesthesia were randomized to receive BSCPB with 20 ml 0.5% ropivacaine (ropivacaine group) or placebo (20 ml saline; saline group) before surgery. The incidence of PONV and postoperative pain, and the need for rescue antiemetics were assessed at 0-24 h postoperatively. RESULTS: Data from 135 patients were evaluated and the incidence of PONV, the need for rescue antiemetics and the number of patients needing additional perioperative pain relief in the postanaesthetic care unit were significantly lower in the ropivacaine group compared with the saline group. Early postoperative (0-8 h) visual analogue scale pain scores were significantly lower in the ropivacaine group compared with the saline group. CONCLUSIONS: BSCPB with 0.5% ropivacaine administered before surgery can significantly reduce the incidence of PONV and early postoperative pain and also reduce perioperative opioid requirements in thyroidectomy patients undergoing general anaesthesia.",eng,1

Mercuri,2010.0,The use of prolonged peripheral neural blockade after lower extremity amputation: the effect on symptoms associated with phantom limb syndrome,10.1213/ANE.0b013e3181f4e848,"BACKGROUND: Phantom limb syndrome (PLS) is common after limb amputations, involving up to 90% of amputees. Although many different therapies have been evaluated, none has been found to be highly effective. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of a prolonged perineural infusion of a high concentration of local anesthetic solution in preventing PLS. METHODS: A perineural catheter was placed immediately before or during surgery in 71 patients undergoing lower extremity amputation. A continuous infusion of 0.5% ropivacaine was started intraoperatively at 5 mL/h using an elastomeric (nonelectronic) pump, and continued for 4 to 83 days after surgery. PLS was evaluated on the first postoperative day and then 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery. To evaluate the presence and severity of PLS while the patient was receiving the ropivacaine infusion, it was discontinued for 6 to 12 hours before each assessment period (i.e., until the sensation in the extremity returned). The severity of phantom limb and stump pain was assessed using a 5-point verbal rating scale (VRS), with 0 = no pain to 4 = intolerable pain, and phantom"" sensations were recorded as present or absent. If the VRS score was >1 or significant phantom sensations were present, the ropivacaine infusion was immediately restarted at 5 mL/h. If the VRS score remained at 0 to 1 and the patient had not experienced phantom sensations for 48 hours, the infusion was permanently discontinued and the catheter was removed. RESULTS: Median duration of the local anesthetic infusion was 30 days (95% confidence interval, 25-30 days). On postoperative day 1, 73% of the patients complained of severe-to-intolerable pain (visual analog scale >2). However, the incidence of severe-to-intolerable phantom limb pain was only 3% at the end of the 12-month evaluation period. At the end of the 12-month period, the percentage of patients with VRS pain scores were 0 = 84%, 1 = 10%, 2 = 3%, 3 = 3%, and 4 = none. However, phantom limb sensations were present in 39% of patients at the end of the 12-month evaluation period. All patients were able to manage the elastomeric catheter infusion system at home. CONCLUSION: Use of a prolonged postoperative perineural infusion of ropivacaine 0.5% seems to be an effective therapy for the treatment of phantom limb pain and sensations after lower extremity amputation.""",eng,0

Lindsey,2014.0,No benefit of TAP block over wound infiltration in laparoscopic colorectal surgery; results of a double blind randomised controlled trial,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/codi.12640,"Aim: The advances in laparoscopic techniques combined with enhanced recovery pathways have led to faster recuperation and discharge after colorectal surgery. Analgesic strategies like epidural catheters, (intravenous) opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have significant side effects that interfere with rapid recovery and/or wound healing. Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP)-blocks provide regional pain control and seem beneficial compared to PCA only. This study was designed to compare TAP-blocks to wound infiltration in the first 48 hours after colorectal surgery. Method: 72 Patients were randomised between either TAP-block or wound infiltration. TAP-blocks were performed by experienced anaesthetists who used ultrasound guidance to deliver 40 ml of 0.25% Bupivacaine in the transverse abdominis plane. In the control group 40 ml of 0.25% Bupivacaine was injected around trocar- and extraction sites by the surgeon. Both groups received PCA-rescue with intravenous morphine. Patient and nursing staff assessed pain scores at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after surgery. Primary outcome was overall morphine use in the first 48 hours. Results: Of the 72 patients 22 underwent a right hemi-colectomy and 50 a high anterior resection. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant differences in overall morphine use (45.3 vs 43.1 mg, P = 0.073). Pain scores recorded by patients and nursing staff were similar at 6,12, 24 & 48 hours. No differences were found regarding time to mobilisation, resumption of diet and length of hospital stay in both groups. Conclusion: In laparoscopic colorectal surgery local anaesthetic delivered at the end of the procedure has the same analgesic effect as TAP blocks.",English,0

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded study. SETTING: Single-university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consenting patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive preoperative multiple-injection thoracic paravertebral blocks (PVB group, n = 25) or preoperative multiple subcutaneous saline injections at the same site as in the PVB group (control group, n = 25). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intraoperative fentanyl consumption was lower in the PVB group (p < 0.01). The time to first analgesic requirement was longer, and pain score at this time was lower in the PVB group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Postoperative pain scores both at rest and coughing were lower during the first 4 hours in the PVB group than those in the control group (p < 0.01 for 0 hours and p < 0.05 for 1, 2, and 4 hours). Cumulative morphine consumption was significantly less in the PVB group at all time points (p < 0.05 for 12 hours and p < 0.01 for all other time points), but there were no significant differences in sedation scores between the 2 groups. There were no complications because of the blocks. Patient satisfaction with the analgesia was significantly greater (p < 0.05), and first mobilization and hospital discharge were quicker (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively) in the PVB group. CONCLUSION: Perioperative multiple-injection thoracic paravertebral blocks with bupivacaine containing epinephrine provided effective pain relief and a significant reduction in opioid requirements. This approach may also contribute to earlier postoperative ambulation after video-assisted thoracic surgery.",eng,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients scheduled to undergo PBD were prospectively assigned randomly into placebo (30 mL of normal saline) and treatment (30 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine) CPB groups. Each patient received .03 mg/kg of midazolam for premedication before PBD and had access to a patient-controlled analgesia pump during the procedure. The pump was set to deliver 0.2 mg of midazolam and 25 micrograms of fentanyl per dose with a 3-minute lockout time. Vital signs, including heart rate and blood pressure, were continuously monitored during the procedure and recorded for comparison with baseline values. Patients completed a 10-point visual analogue pain scale following completion of their procedure. RESULTS: Patients in the placebo and treatment groups self-administered a mean of 2.0 and 1.85 mg of midazolam, respectively (P = .40), and a mean of 247 and 231 micrograms of fentanyl, respectively (P = .40). On a 10-point pain scale, the mean postprocedure versus preprocedure elevation in pain was 2.1 points in the placebo group versus 1.6 points in the treatment group (P = .60). Overall, the degree of satisfaction with the analgesia was equal in both groups. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that CPB is not an effective means of providing additional visceral pain relief over and above that which can be accomplished with self-administered intravenous medication for patients who undergo PBD.",eng,1

Murray,2006.0,Complications of regional anesthesia,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.aco.0000245280.99786.a3,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The use of regional anesthesia, either alone or as an adjunct to general anesthesia, is at an all-time high. Demonstrated benefits include reduced side effects, more efficient use of facilities and enhanced patient satisfaction with the improved postoperative pain relief. New advances in equipment, techniques and medications have been incorporated over the past 10 years, and especially over the last 2 years. As the number of practitioners and procedures increase, the number of complications may rise as well. RECENT FINDINGS: The specific issues of nerve damage, treatment of local anesthetic toxicity with lipid solutions and prevention of wrong-sided procedures are examined with special reference to recent publications. SUMMARY: Specific needle shapes, appropriate pharmacologic resuscitation from intravascular injection of local anesthetics and institutional procedures to positively identify patients and the correct block location are all part of a strategy to minimize the occurrence of adverse outcomes and to mitigate the consequences of those adverse events when they do occur. More importantly, these are changes that can be instituted immediately with minimal expense to the institution and great benefit to the patient. 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",English,0

Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks have been found to be beneficial in improving pain for a variety of abdominal operations. The objective of this study was to determine if single dose TAP blocks are useful in improving postoperative recovery following laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Methods: A prospective double blind randomized clinical trial, involving 158 consecutive patients having laparoscopic colorectal surgery, was performed by a university colorectal surgical department. Patients were randomized to either TAP blockade using ultrasound guidance, or control, with the primary outcome being postoperative pain, measured by analgesic consumption. Secondary outcomes included pain visual analogue score (VAS), respiratory function, time to return of gut function, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and patient satisfaction. Results: One hundred and forty-two patients were followed to trial completion (74 control, 68 intervention). Patients were well matched with regards to demographics. No complications occurred as a result of the intervention of TAP blockade. There was no difference between groups with regards to analgesic consumption (161 MEq morphine control v 175 MEq morphine TAP). There was no difference between the two groups with regards to the secondary outcomes of daily VAS, respiratory outcome, time to return of gut function, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and patient satisfaction. Conclusion: Single dose TAP blockade appears to be a safe intervention, but confers no specific advantage following laparoscopic colorectal surgery.",English,0

We conducted this double-blinded study to determine whether clonidine has analgesic effects when administered into the brachial plexus sheath. At the conclusion of hand or forearm surgery, performed under axillary brachial plexus block, 45 patients were randomly divided into three groups of 15 each to receive, through an axillary catheter, 15 mL of saline (Group Saline), clonidine 150 microg in 15 mL of saline (Group Clonidine), or bupivacaine 15 mL (Group Bupivacaine). The analgesic effects of the three solutions were evaluated for 6 h. Times to onset of pain and to first analgesic request were longer, and the total dose of pain medication was smaller in Group Bupivacaine compared with the other groups. Visual analog scores were significantly lower in Group Bupivacaine. There was no significant difference in time to onset of pain, time to first analgesic request, total dose of pain medication, and visual analog scores between Group Saline and Group Clonidine at any time. We conclude that the administration of clonidine 150 microg into the brachial plexus sheath does not prolong the onset of postoperative pain. IMPLICATIONS: Used as the sole analgesic, clonidine produces analgesia after epidural, intrathecal, and intraarticular administration. It also prolongs the analgesic effect of brachial plexus block when mixed with local anesthetics. In this study, the administration of clonidine 150 microg alone into the brachial plexus sheath did not produce postoperative analgesia.",eng,1

This study evaluated the analgesic efficacy of either performing a prophylactic suprascapular nerve block with bupivacaine or applying a piroxicam patch to the skin over both shoulders for the relief of shoulder tip pain after laparoscopy. METHODS: Sixty healthy informed female patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) a control group (n = 20), no treatment; (b) a suprascapular nerve block group (n = 20) in which a bilateral suprascapular nerve block was performed before induction of anaesthesia with 5 mL 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine; and (c) a piroxicam patch group (n = 20) in which a 48 mg piroxicam patch on the skin of each shoulder was applied before induction of anaesthesia. All patients received a total intravenous anaesthesia technique with propofol, fentanyl and vecuronium. Shoulder tip and wound pain were recorded on a visual analogue pain scale at five time intervals for 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 80% of patients in the control group, 75% in the suprascapular nerve block group and 45% in the piroxicam patch group complained of shoulder tip pain during the recording period (P < 0.05). The scores for shoulder tip pain in the piroxicam patch group were significantly lower compared with the control group at 3, 6 and 12 h, and compared with the suprascapular nerve block group at 6 and 12 h.

However, conflicting reports on its analgesic effectiveness exist. No study has investigated plasma local anesthetic concentration following ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block (USGRSB) in children. Objectives Compare the effectiveness and bupivacaine absorption following USGRSB or wound infiltration (WI) for umbilical hernia repair in children. Methods A randomized blinded study comparing WI with USGRSB in 40 children undergoing umbilical hernia repair was performed. Group WI (n = 20) received wound infiltration 1 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> 0.25% bupivacaine. Group RS (n = 20) received USGRSB 0.5 mgkg<sup>-1</sup> 0.25% bupivacaine per side in the posterior rectus sheath compartment. Pain scores and rescue analgesia were recorded. Blood samples were drawn at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min. Results Patients in the WI group had a twofold increased risk of requiring morphine (hazard ratio 2.06, 95% CI 1.01, 4.20, P = 0.05). When required, median time to first morphine dose was longer in the USGRSB group (65.5 min vs 47.5 min, P = 0.049). Peak plasma bupivacaine concentration was higher following USGRSB than WI (median: 631.9 ngml<sup>-1</sup> IQR: 553.9-784.1 vs 389.7 ngml<sup>-1</sup> IQR: 250.5-502.7, P = 0.002).

The primary reason for failure is pain. There is no consensus upon the routine use of analgesia during hysteroscopy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of different types of pharmacological interventions for pain relief in patients undergoing hysteroscopy. SEARCH STRATEGY: A search of medical literature databases including PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINHAL (to February 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating pharmacological interventions for pain relief during hysteroscopy were investigated. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Results for each study were expressed as a standardised mean difference with 95% confidence interval and combined for meta-analysis with Revman 5 software. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-four RCTS were identified involving a total of 3155 participants, with 15 studies included in the meta-analysis.Meta-analysis (nine RCTs, 1296 participants) revealed a significant reduction in the mean pain score for the use of local anaesthetics during the procedure compared with placebo (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.17, I(2) = 82%).Meta-analysis (4 RCTs, 454 participants) demonstrated a significant reduction in the mean pain score for the use of local anaesthetics within 30 minutes after the procedure compared with placebo (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.21, I(2) = 54%).There was no significant reduction in the mean pain score with the use of NSAIDS or opioid analgesics compared with placebo during or within 30 minutes after the procedure.There was no significant reduction in the mean pain score with the use of local anaesthetics, NSAIDS or opioid analgesics compared with placebo more than 30 minutes after the procedure.There was no significant difference between the number of incidents of failure to complete the procedure due to cervical stenosis between the intervention and control groups (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.59; 6 RCTs, 805 participants).There were significantly fewer incidents of failure to complete the procedure due to pain in the intervention group than in the control group (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.69; two studies, 330 participants).Meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference between the intervention and placebo groups with regards to adverse effects.

All patients in the epidural group had bilateral blockade, compared with three patients in the paravertebral group. In both groups only minor insignificant changes in blood pressure and pulse rate were seen postoperatively. Pain scores were significantly higher in the paravertebral group, as was the need for systemic morphine (P less than 0.05). Pulmonary function estimated by forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume and peak expiratory flow rate decreased about 50% postoperatively in both groups.

This double-blind, randomized controlled study was conducted to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) performed under general anaesthesia in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy. METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive consenting patients were randomized to receive a BSCPB with saline (Group P, n = 29), ropivacaine 0.487% (Group R, n = 29), or ropivacaine 0.487% plus clonidine 5 microg ml(-1) (Group RC, n = 29). Sufentanil was given during the intraoperative period for a 20% increase in arterial mean pressure or heart rate in a patient with a bispectral index between 40 and 60. All patients received 4 g of acetaminophen during the first 24 h after operation. The pain score was checked every 4 h and nefopam was given for pain score >4 on a numeric pain scale. RESULTS: During surgery, the median sufentanil requirements were significantly reduced in Group RC compared with Groups R and P (0.32 vs 0.47 and 0.62 microg kg(-1); P < 0.0001). After surgery, the number of patients requiring nefopam within 24 h of surgery was significantly lower in Groups R and RC than in Group P (16 and 19 vs 25; P = 0.03). At post-anaesthetic care unit admission, median (range) pain scores were significantly lower in Groups R [3 (0-10)] and RC [3 (0-8)] than in Group P [5 (0-8), P = 0.03]. No major complications of BSCPB occurred during study. CONCLUSIONS: BSCPB with ropivacaine and clonidine improved intraoperative analgesia. BSCPB with ropivacaine or ropivaciane and clonidine was effective in reducing analgesic requirements after thyroid surgery.",eng,1

Study design: Twenty patients underwent removal of bilateral lower third molars under local anesthesia (articaine or mepivacaine) in 2 separate appointments, in a double-blind, randomized, and crossed manner. Objective and subjective parameters were recorded for paired comparison of postoperative courses. Results: Duration of analgesia provided by articaine and mepivacaine was 198.00 + 25.86, and 125.40 + 13.96 min, respectively (P = .02), whereas the duration of anesthesia was 273.80 + 15.94 and 216.85 + 20.15 min, respectively (P = .06). Both solutions exerted no important effects upon arterial pressure, heart rate, or oxygen saturation (P > .05). Conclusions: Articaine provides a longer period of analgesic effect and a tendency for a longer period of anesthesia as compared to mepivacaine. The presence of a vasoconstrictor agent in local anesthetic solutions does not seem to influence hemodynamic parameters during lower third molar removal in healthy subjects. 2006 Mosby, Inc.

Journal Article,L. Le-Wendling; F. K. Enneking,2008.0,Continuous peripheral nerve blockade for postoperative analgesia,10.1097/ACO.0b013e32830a4be6,PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the recent literature involving the use of continuous peripheral nerve sheath catheters in the management of postoperative pain. RECENT FINDINGS: Continuous peripheral nerve blocks provide superior analgesia and are associated with fewer opioid-induced side effects for patients undergoing extremity surgery. Ultrasound technology is being used with increasing frequency to guide the placements of continuous peripheral nerve blocks. The evidence is still equivocal regarding the superiority of stimulating versus nonstimulating catheters for the delivery of continuous peripheral nerve blockade. The incidence of major complications associated with continuous peripheral nerve blocks is very low and probably no different from single injection peripheral nerve blocks. SUMMARY: Continuous peripheral nerve blocks are an excellent additional modality to compliment other multimodal analgesics to control moderate to severe postoperative pain.,eng,0

Chassard,2006.0,Efficacy and plasma levels of ropivacaine for children: controlled regional analgesia following lower limb surgery,10.1093/bja/ael145,"BACKGROUND: Continuous regional analgesia (CRA) is considered a safe and efficacious technique for postoperative pain relief in children after lower limb surgery. We recently evaluated the feasibility of patient-controlled regional analgesia (PCRA) in a similar acute pain situation and we concluded that PCRA might be advantageous over CRA in terms of lower costs, risk of systemic toxicity while producing similarly adequate analgesia. We therefore prospectively compared both techniques in the paediatric population. METHODS: In total, 30 children undergoing lower limb orthopaedic surgery were randomized to receive PCRA or CRA with ropivacaine 0.2%. Visual analogue scale scores, rescue analgesia, overall satisfaction, motor blockade and plasma ropivacaine concentrations were recorded for 48 h. RESULTS: Adequate analgesia was achieved with both techniques. No significant difference was noted for rescue analgesia, overall satisfaction and motor blockade. In contrast, children in the PCRA group received significantly less local anaesthetics than those in the CRA group. In addition, total plasma concentrations of ropivacaine were significantly reduced in the PCRA group as compared with the CRA group during the 48 h postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques are efficacious and satisfactory. However, PCRA with ropivacaine 0.2% can provide adequate postoperative analgesia for paediatric orthopaedic procedures with smaller doses of ropivacaine than CRA.",eng,0

Hogan,2001.0,Regional block and mexiletine: the effect on pain after cancer breast surgery,10.1053/rapm.2001.23205,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Breast surgery for cancer is associated with chronic pain and sensory abnormalities. The present study investigates the effect of regional block, oral mexiletine, and the combination of both, on acute and chronic pain associated with cancer breast surgery. METHODS: One hundred patients scheduled for cancer breast surgery received either regional block with 18 mL of 1% ropivacaine intraoperatively and oral mexiletine for the first 6 postoperative days (R + M group), or regional block and placebo (R + PL), or normal saline instead of ropivacaine and mexiletine (PL + M), or normal saline and placebo (PL + PL). Postoperative analgesic requirements were recorded daily. Pain was assessed 0, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and on the second to sixth day postoperatively, at rest, and after movement using the visual analog scale (VAS). Three months after surgery, patients were interviewed for the presence and intensity of pain, abnormal sensations, and analgesic requirements. RESULTS: Regional block reduced the number of intramuscular (IM) injections required the first 24 hours (P =.05), the R + PL group requiring less injections versus the PL + M group (P =.037). Lonarid tablet (paracetamol and codeine) consumption from the second to the fifth postoperative day differed among the 4 groups (P =.0304), the R + M group requiring fewer tablets than the PL + PL group (P =.009). Three hours postoperatively, the R + PL group had less pain at rest when compared with all other groups (P <.05 for all comparisons). On the second postoperative day, VAS at rest and after movement was less in the R + M versus the R + PL group (P <.01 and P <.05, respectively). Three months after surgery, the 4 groups were similar with regard to incidence or intensity of pain or analgesic requirements. The R + PL group had a lower incidence (77%) of reduced or absent sensation (P =.016). CONCLUSIONS: Regional block reduced the analgesic requirements in the early postoperative period, while mexiletine combined with regional block reduced the total analgesic requirements during the next 5 postoperative days. Although chronic pain was not affected by these treatments late-abnormal sensation may be diminished by combination of these treatments. Reg Anesth Pain Med 2001;26:223-228.",eng,1

An alternative is paravertebral block. We investigated whether ropivacaine, administered through a paravertebral catheter placed by the surgeon, reduced postoperative pain. METHODS: In a randomized double-blind study, adult patients with a paravertebral catheter placed by the thoracic surgeon after thoracotomy were randomly assigned to receive through this catheter, either a 0.1 mlkg(-1) bolus of 0.5% ropivacaine, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 mlkg(-1)h(-1) for 48 h, or saline at the same scheme of administration. Patients also benefited from patient-controlled analgesia with intravenous morphine (bolus 1mg, lockout time 7 min), paracetamol, and nefopam. The primary endpoint was pain intensity on a visual analog scale at rest and on coughing. Secondary endpoints were total morphine consumption and side effects during the first 48 postoperative hours. Surgeons, anesthesiologists, and all the nurses and caring staff involved in this study were blinded. Solutions of saline and ropivacaine were prepared identically by the central pharmacy, without any possible identification of the product. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with contraindications to epidural anesthesia were included. There were no significant differences between the groups receiving ropivacaine and saline in terms of pain severity at rest and on coughing, mean postoperative morphine consumption (45.7 mg for ropivacaine, 43.2mg in controls), and incidence of morphine-related side effects (nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, pruritus, respiratory rate, and sedation). CONCLUSIONS: Paravertebral block using a catheter placed by the thoracic surgeon was ineffective on postoperative pain after thoracotomy and did not confirm the analgesic effect that has been observed after percutaneous catheter placement. A direct comparison of these two placement methods is required.",eng,1

Laringoscopy, endotracheal entubation, insertion of skull pins, surgical incision, dural opening are most; stressful steps during neurosurgery. Objectives: To compare the effects of sku11 block with levobupivacaine vs placebo on hemodynamics and bispectral index variables (BIS) during skull pin insertion and craniotomy. Material/Patients and Methods: Sixty patients, ASA I-III, aged 18-180 y, scheduled for craniotomy were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind study. Patients were randomly assigned in two groups, 30 patients in each warm. After intubation with standard protocol, scalp block was performed with 20 mL %0.9 sodium chloride in Group I and with 20 mL 2.5% levobupivacaine in Group II. Heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and BIS were recorded before anesthesia induction, during the scalp block and 30 min after surgery. Visiual analog pain scores (VAS), first analgesic requirement and postoperative 24-hour analgesic consumption were also recorded. Results: HR, SBP, DBP, MAP and BIS values obtained after surgery were significantly improved compared to baseline values in Group II (p<0.05). Compared to hemodynamics and BIS values in Group I, those values obtained in Group II were significantly better at each time point (p<0.05) the postoperative VAS scores and total analgesic consumption in Group II were significantly lower than those in Group I.

This randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial examines the effects of multilevel ultrasound-guided paravertebral blocks (PVBs) and total intravenous anesthesia on QoR after ambulatory breast tumor resection. METHODS: Sixty-six women were randomized to standardized general anesthesia (control group) or PVBs and propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (PVB group). The PVB group received T1-T5 PVBs with 5 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine per level, whereas the control group received sham subcutaneous injections. Postoperative QoR was designated as the primary outcome. The 29-item ambulatory QoR tool was administered in the preadmission clinic, before discharge, and on postoperative days 2, 4, and 7. Secondary outcomes included block success, pain scores, intra- and postoperative morphine consumption, time to rescue analgesia, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and hospital discharge time. RESULTS: Data from sixty-four patients were analyzed. The PVB group had higher QoR scores than control group upon discharge (146 vs. 131; P < 0.0001) and on postoperative day 2 (145 vs. 135; P = 0.013); improvements beyond postoperative day 2 lacked statistical significance. None of the PVB group patients required conversion to inhalation gas-based general anesthesia or experienced block-related complications. PVB group patients had improved pain scores on postanesthesia care unit admission and discharge, hospital discharge, and postoperative day 2; their intraoperative morphine consumption, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and discharge time were also reduced. CONCLUSION: Combining multilevel PVBs with total intravenous anesthesia provides reliable anesthesia, improves postoperative analgesia, enhances QoR, and expedites discharge compared with inhalational gas- and opioid-based general anesthesia for ambulatory breast tumor resection.",eng,1

Local anaesthesia has become an important part of optimizing intra and post-operative pain treatment, but is sometimes not entirely sufficient. The aim of the present study was to study the effect of adding an ankle block to a multi-modal analgesic approach on the first 24-hour-need for rescue analgesia in patients undergoing elective Hallux Valgus surgery. TYPE OF STUDY: Prospective, randomized patient-blind study comparing ankle block with levo-bupivacaine, lidocaine and Saline placebo control. METHODS: Ninety patients were studied comparing ankle block (15 cc) using levo-bupivacaine 2.5 mg/ml, lidocaine 10 mg/ml or placebo (saline) on day-case elective Hallux Valgus surgery, supported by general anaesthesia in all cases. Primary study endpoint was number of patient's requiring oral analgesics during the first 24 post-operative hours. RESULTS: Ankle block had no effect on need for rescue analgesia and pain ratings during the 1st 24 postoperative hours, there was no difference seen between placebo and any of the two active local anaesthesia studied. The only differences seen was that both lidocaine and levo-bupivacaine reduced the intra-operative need for anaesthetic (sevoflurane) and that levo-bupivacaine patients had a lower need as compared to the lidocaine patients for oral analgesics during the afternoon of surgery. CONCLUSION: Adding a single shot ankle block to a multi-modal pain management strategy reduces the need for intra-operative anaesthesia but has no major impact of need of rescue analgesics or pain during the first 24-hour after surgery.",eng,0

Systemic analgesia may produce complications as a result of impaired renal function. We investigated whether combined lower intercostal and Ilioinguinal-Iliohypogastric (IG-IH) nerve block might improve the quality of analgesia and reduce morphine consumption during the first 24 h after surgery. METHODS: Forty-two patients, scheduled as kidney transplant recipients were randomized into two equal groups and were anesthetized with the same technique. After surgery IG-IH, T11 and T12 intercostal nerves on the side of surgery were blocked by bupivacaine 0.5%. The control group was not blocked. Postoperative pain and total amount of morphine consumption were recorded by a person who was blinded to the allocation. RESULTS: There were significant differences in median visual analog scale scores (25th-75th) measurements at all time points in the study groups (P < 0.05). The total amount of morphine consumption during 24 h was 12.7 +/- 10.5 mg in the blocked group compared with 34.9 +/- 5.9 mg in the nonblocked group (P < 0.001).

The hypothesis tested in this study was that this policy was also suitable to improve pain control after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). METHODS: This was a prospective randomized study on 40 patients submitted to three-ports' VATS for pneumothorax or solitary pulmonary nodule. The sample size was calculated to detect one point of minimum pain score difference with 80% statistical power. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) paravertebral block group (PVB) (n=20) - At the end of surgery, a catheter was placed in patients in the thoracic paravertebral space under camera control; they received a bolus of 15 ml of local anesthetic (ropivacaine 0.2%) every 6h, combined with endovenous metamizol (1g); and (2) alternate NSAIDs group (AN) (n=20) - They were treated with paracetamol (1g) combined with metamizol (1g) every 6h. Subcutaneous meperidine (synthetic opioid) was employed as rescue drug. Both groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, pathology, and co-morbidity. Pain level was measured with the visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 6, 24, and 48 h. RESULTS: No side effects related to any of the two analgesic techniques were noted. Two patients needed rescue meperidine in the AN group, and none in the PVB group. VAS scores were the following: PVB group, VAS 1h: 1.4+/-0.8, VAS 6h: 3.4+/-1.2, VAS 24h: 2.6+/-1.0, VAS 48 h: 2.2+/-0.9, and mean VAS: 2.4+/-1.3; AN group, VAS 1h: 2.8+/-1.0, VAS 6h: 4.9+/-1.3, VAS 24h: 3.9+/-1.4, VAS 48 h: 3.3+/-1.0, and mean VAS: 3.8+/-1.4. VAS scores were significantly lower at any time in the PVB patients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The analgesic regimen combining PVB and NSAID provided an excellent level of pain control. Thoracoscopy assisted positioning of the paravertebral catheter is simple and effective, and allows direct visualization of correct delivery of local anesthetic. It represents a valuable addition to any VATS procedure.",eng,1

Materials and methods We studied 100 patients on warfarin undergoing cataract surgery; randomly allocated into one of two groups; sub-Tenon's group (group S, n = 50), and peribulbar group (group P, n = 50). In group (S), sub-Tenon's injection of 3-5 ml of anesthetic agent was done using a 25 mm sub-Tenon's cannula. In group (P), the peribulbar block with 3-4 ml of 2% lidocaine-hyaluronidase (10 IU/ml) and 0.5% bupivacaine was done. Pain and akinesia and postoperative complications were assessed. Results Sub-Tenon group showed significantly higher frequency of hemorrhage compared to peribulbar group (30% versus 8%, p = 0.041), mainly of grade I. The two groups had comparable frequency of subconjunctival hemorrhage (p = 1.000). No patients experienced sight-threatening hemorrhagic complications. Pain was significantly lower in the sub-Tenon group. Akinesia was significantly better (p = 0.025) 2 min after injection and comparable from 4 to 10 min after injection in the peribulbar group. The majority of patients in the two groups reported satisfaction (p = 0.372). The surgeon expressed higher satisfaction with peribulbar block (94%) compared to sub-Tenon's block (81%) (p = 0.064). Conclusion Peribulbar and sub-Tenon techniques were relatively safe in patients on anticoagulants during cataract operation. We recommend peribulbar technique owing to significantly less bleeding and more satisfactory akinesia response and hence surgeon comfort. 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.",English,0

METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients undergoing transvaginal pelvic reconstructive surgery under general anesthesia were randomized to receive pudendal block with either bupivacaine 0.25% or placebo (normal saline 0.9%) immediately before surgery. All patients received postoperative intravenous hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia. Patients were asked to report on their pain intensity 1, 3, 5, 7, 18, and 24 hours postoperatively, using a validated visual analog pain scale from 0-10. Main outcome measures included postoperative pain intensity and hydromorphone consumption. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients enrolled in the study, of whom 106 underwent randomization, and 102 received pudendal nerve blockade, 51 with bupivacaine and 51 with saline. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics were not significantly different between the 2 patients groups. There were no significant differences in postoperative pain intensity (median scores: 1 hour, 4.0 versus 5.0; 3 hours, 3.0 versus 4.0; 7 hours, 2.0 versus 3.0; 18 hours, 3.0 versus 4.0), the consumption of hydromorphone (0-3 hours, 1.84 mg versus 1.77 mg; 4-7 hours, 1.19 mg versus 1.20 mg; 8-18 hours, 2.89 mg versus 2.35 mg), or mean hospital stay (39.6 versus 37.3 hours) between the bupivacaine and saline groups.

Amiri,2011.0,Comparing caudal and penile nerve blockade using bupivacaine in hypospadias repair surgeries in children,10.4103/0189-6725.91673,"BACKGROUND: Caudal anaesthesia is recommended for most surgical procedures of the lower part of the body, mainly below the umbilicus. It has been well established that a dorsal penile nerve block immediately after surgery decreases postoperative pain in children undergoing hypospadias repair. This study aimed to compare caudal or penile nerve block using bupivacaine in postoperative pain control in hypospadias repair in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After local ethical committee approval and obtaining informed parental consent, 85 American society of Anesthesiologists status I and II patients, aged 6 months to 6 years old, undergoing hypospadias repair, were prospectively enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly divided into the following two groups: Caudal block was performed in 44 and penile block was performed in 41 patients. Cardiorespiratory systems data, analgesic requirement and complications were compared between the groups. RESULTS: There were statistically significant haemodynamic (blood pressure and heart rate) alteration during operation in each group (P<0.01). The haemodynamic parameters were stable during operation in successful blocks in both groups. Caudal block success rate is 97.7%, whereas in penile block is 92.6%. Nineteen of 43 patients (44%) in caudal group and 29 of 41 patients (70%) in penile group received analgesia in the postoperative period and this difference was significant between the two groups (P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Without ultrasonography and with blind block, with anatomic landmarks only, the caudal block success rate is high and if there is no contraindication for caudal block, it is the best choice in children under 6 years old (or 25 kg) for hypospadias repair.",eng,1

Subcostal TAP block has also been proposed as a new technique to provide analgesia for the supraumbilical abdomen. We compared the analgesic and opioid-sparing effects of a single-injection subcostal TAP block with continuous thoracic epidural analgesia and IV opioid analgesia. METHODS: Ninety patients undergoing elective radical gastrectomy were randomized to receive either combined general-subcostal TAP anesthesia (group TAP), combined general-epidural anesthesia (group EA), or general anesthesia (group GA), and were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. In group TAP, a bilateral subcostal TAP block was performed after induction of general anesthesia using 20 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine. In group EA, a thoracic epidural was placed between T8 and T9 and bolused with 8 mL of 0.25% ropivacaine before induction of general anesthesia. The epidural was maintained with 5 mL/h of 0.25% ropivacaine during the surgery. Group GA received standard general anesthesia. In the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), all groups received IV morphine titration for visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores >3. All patients were started on IV patient-controlled analgesia with morphine after morphine titration in the PACU, while group EA also had their epidural maintained with 5 mL/h of 0.125% bupivacaine with 8 mug/mL morphine. Patients were assessed in the PACU and at 1, 3, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. Primary outcomes measured were morphine consumption at 24 hours and all VAS pain scores. RESULTS: Data from 82 of 90 (91.1%) patients were included in the study. Group TAP demonstrated decreased cumulative morphine consumption at 24 hours (98.75% confidence intervals, -29 to -9 mg) and noninferiority on VAS pain scores at all measurement times, as compared with group GA with standard opioid analgesia. However, group EA was superior to group TAP regarding cumulative morphine consumption at 24 hours (98.75% confidence intervals, -23 to -4 mg) and noninferior to group TAP on VAS pain scores at all comparison points. Group TAP had reduced morphine consumption from PACU admission to 6 hours as compared with group GA, but increased morphine consumption for 6 to 24 hours as compared with group EA. CONCLUSION: Single-injection subcostal TAP block was more effective than IV opioid analgesia, while continuous thoracic epidural analgesia was more effective than the single-injection subcostal TAP block.",eng,1

Methods: Between February and May 2009, 60 patients undergoing full muscle-sparing posterior minithoracotomy were prospectively randomized into two groups, according to the thoracotomy closure techniques. In the first group (group A), two holes were drilled into the sixth rib using a hand perforator, and sutures were passed through the holes in the sixth rib and were circled from the upper edge of the fifth rib, thereby compressing the intercostal nerve underneath the fifth rib. In the second group (group B), the intercostal muscle underneath the fifth rib was partially dissected along with the intercostal nerve, corresponding to the holes on the sixth rib. Two 1/0 polyglactin (Vicyrl) sutures were passed through the holes in the sixth rib and above the intercostal nerve. Results: There were 30 patients in each group. The visual analog score, observer verbal ranking scale (OVRS) scores for pain, and Ramsay sedation scores were used to follow-up on postoperative analgesia and sedation. The von Frey hair test was used to evaluate hyperalgesia of the patients. The patients in group B had lower visual analog scores at rest and during coughing. The patients in group B had lower OVRS scores than group A patients. The groups were not statistically different in terms of the Ramsay sedation scores and von Frey hair tests.

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized study. SETTING: A single hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve adult patients undergoing posterolateral thoracotomies. INTERVENTIONS: Paravertebral or interpleural administration of bupivacaine. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Analgesia, as assessed by visual analog pain scores and patient-controlled morphine requirements, was similar in both groups. Postoperative spirometric values were significantly better at most times with the paravertebral route of administration. Dependent chest tube bupivacaine losses were approximately four times higher in the interpleural group. CONCLUSION: Local anesthetic on the diaphragm might actively impair respiratory function through diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle weakness, while failing to contribute to pain relief.",eng,0

Buggy,2014.0,Differential effects of serum from patients administered distinct anaesthetic techniques on apoptosis in breast cancer cells in vitro: a pilot study,10.1093/bja/aet581,"BACKGROUND: In vitro and retrospective clinical studies suggest an association between anaesthetic technique during primary breast cancer surgery and cancer outcome. Apoptosis is an important step in the mechanism of breast cancer metastasis, but whether it is influenced by anaesthetic technique is unknown. Using serum from breast cancer surgery patients randomized to receive distinct anaesthetic techniques, we investigated its effect on apoptosis in oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer cells in vitro. METHODS: Women with biopsy-proven breast cancer were randomized to receive either propofol general anaesthesia with paravertebral analgesia (PPA) or standard sevoflurane general anaesthesia with opioid analgesia (SGA) in an ongoing, prospective clinical trial (NCT 00418457). Serum from a randomly selected subset of these patients (10 PPA and 10 SGA) who had donated 20 ml venous blood immediately before anaesthetic induction and at 1 h after operation was exposed to ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Apoptosis was measured using ApoLive-Glo Multiplex Assay. RESULTS: Exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to postoperative serum of PPA patients resulted in higher luminescence ratio (apoptosis) than SGA patients, median (25-75%), 0.40 (0.35-0.43) compared with 0.22 (0.21-0.30), respectively (P=0.001). The luminescence ratio of postoperative serum from SGA was reduced compared with preoperative SGA 0.22 (0.21-0.30) compared with 0.3 (0.25-0.35) (P=0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Serum from patients given sevoflurane anaesthesia and opioids for primary breast cancer surgery reduces apoptosis in ER-negative breast cancer cells to a greater extent than serum from patients given propofol-paravertebral anaesthesia. Anaesthetic technique might affect the serum milieu in a manner that impacts cancer cell apoptosis, and thereby tumour metastasis.",eng,0

McCaul,2011.0,Comparison of transversus abdominis plane block vs spinal morphine for pain relief after Caesarean section,10.1093/bja/aer061,"BACKGROUND: Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is an alternative to spinal morphine for analgesia after Caesarean section but there are few data on its comparative efficacy. We compared the analgesic efficacy of the TAP block with and without spinal morphine after Caesarean section in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Eighty patients were randomized to one of four groups to receive (in addition to spinal anaesthesia) either spinal morphine 100 microg (S(M)) or saline (S(S)) and a postoperative bilateral TAP block with either bupivacaine (T(LA)) 2 mg kg(-1) or saline (T(S)). RESULTS: Pain on movement and early morphine consumption were lowest in groups receiving spinal morphine and was not improved by TAP block. The rank order of median pain scores on movement at 6 h was: S(M)T(LA) (20 mm)<S(M)T(S) (27.5 mm)<S(S)T(S) (51.5 mm)<S(S)T(LA) (52.0 mm) (P<0.05, highest vs lowest). The rank order of median morphine consumption at 6 h was: S(M)T(S) (4.0 mg)<S(M)T(LA) (5.0 mg)<S(S)T(LA) (8.0 mg)<S(S)T(S) (12.0 mg) and at 24 h was: S(M)T(LA) (5.0 mg)<S(M)T(S) (6.0 mg)<S(S)T(S) (9.5 mg)<S(S)T(LA) (15.0 mg) (P<0.05, highest vs lowest). Sedation scores and patient satisfaction did not differ between groups. Anti-emetic use and pruritus were highest in the S(M)T(LA) group. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal morphine-but not TAP block-improved analgesia after Caesarean section. The addition of TAP block with bupivacaine 2 mg kg(-1) to spinal morphine did not further improve analgesia.",eng,1

METHODS: Twenty-nine patients scheduled for scleral buckling were included in this double-blind, randomized, prospective study. After induction of general anesthesia and opening of the conjunctiva, patients received either 4 mL bupivacaine 0.5% or 4 mL saline 0.9% injected into the retrobulbar space preoperatively. Heart rate and blood pressure were documented before the start of anesthesia, 10 and 50 minutes later, and 60 minutes after completion of surgery. At the same time points, 10 mL of blood were withdrawn for measurement of glucose and cortisol levels to evaluate the efficacy of retrobulbar block in eliminating humoral response. Postoperative scores for pain and vigilance were recorded 1, 6, and 24 hours after completion of surgery. The application of analgesic and antiemetic drugs was documented, as well as occurrence of nausea and vomiting. RESULTS: A preoperative retrobulbar block in patients undergoing scleral buckling reduces pain, endogenous stress response, and improves vigilance. CONCLUSIONS: Because the analgesic effect of the retrobulbar block was considerably longer than pharmacologically expected, the combined retrobulbar and general anesthesia protects"" against postoperative pain and is recommended for patients undergoing scleral buckling.""",eng,1
Journal Article,J. M. Kamal Abdel-halim,2011.0,Continuous thoracic paravertebral block: An adjunct to general anaesthesia in major breast surgery,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egja.2011.03.001,"Background: Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is an effective intraoperative and postoperative technique for surgical anaesthesia and analgesia for breast surgery. It offers a long-lasting effective analgesia without increases in side effects, with a significant decrease in anaesthetic and analgesic consumption, and with a high degree of patient satisfaction and shorter recovery time. In this study, TPVB was done by using a nerve stimulator to measure the depth of needle insertion by eliciting intercostal muscle contraction, and a catheter was introduced preoperatively to allow for repeated injections and to maintain analgesia postoperatively. Methods: Two groups of patients undergoing unilateral cancer breast surgery (each 20 patients) were randomly assigned to the study; a study group (PVB) and a control (C) group. The study started by preoperative application of an epidural catheter by using the nerve stimulator at the fourth thoracic paravertebral space in the study group and injection of local anaesthetic started preoperatively. General anaesthesia was started for the two groups. Total intraoperative fentanyl and postoperative morphine consumption, and pain intensity at rest and with arm movement were recorded, together with recording of any undesirable side effects for 24 h. Results: There were statistically highly significant decreases in intraoperative fentanyl consumption and postoperative morphine consumption in the PVB group than the C group. There were statistically significant decreases in the VAS in the PVB group than the C group both at rest and with shoulder movement. The incidence of adverse events was very low in both groups. Conclusion: Continuous TPVB provides effective pain relief, significant opioid sparing, and also less painful restricted movement of the shoulder, with few side effects after breast cancer surgery. Thoracic paravertebral somatic nerve block may be an alternative to general anaesthesia for major unilateral breast surgery with heavy sedation or to be combined with light general anaesthesia. 2011 Egyptian Society of Anesthesiologists.

We hypothesized that performance of a lumbar plexus block (LPB) would reduce postoperative pain in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) for patients discharged home on the day of surgery. METHODS: Patients received a combined spinal epidural with IV sedation, ondansetron, and ketorolac. Half of the patients (n = 42) also underwent a single-injection bupivacaine LPB. Postoperative analgesia (PACU and after discharge) was provided with oral hydrocodone/acetaminophen (5/500 mg) and an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug. IV hydromorphone was given as needed in the PACU. RESULTS: The LPB reduced pain at rest in the PACU (GEE: beta estimate of the mean on a 0 to 10 scale = -0.9; 95% confidence interval = -1.7 to -0.1; P = 0.037). Mean PACU pain scores at rest were reduced by the LPB from 4.2 to 3.3 (P = 0.048, 95% confidence interval for difference = 0.007-1.8; uncorrected for multiple values per patient, using independent samples t test for preliminary evaluation comparing pain between the groups). There were no statistically significant differences in PACU analgesic usage, PACU pain with movement, and patient satisfaction. No permanent adverse events occurred, but 2 LPB patients fell in the PACU bathroom, without injury. Three unplanned admissions occurred; one LPB patient was admitted for epidural spread and urinary retention. Two control patients were admitted, one for oxygen desaturation and one for pain and nausea. CONCLUSION: LPB resulted in statistically significant reductions in PACU resting pain after hip arthroscopy, but the absence of improvement in most secondary outcomes suggests that assessment of risks and benefits of LPB should be individualized.",eng,1

DESIGN: Randomized triple blind trial. SETTING: Gynecological endoscopy unit at a referral center for laparoscopic surgery. POPULATION: A total of 197 patients. METHODS: Comparison of a treatment group receiving TAP block with bupivacaine 0.25% and placebo group with comparably placed bilateral injection of sterile saline solution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain scores at discharge 24, 48 and 72 h after surgery, opioid requirement after procedure. RESULTS: Patients who had TAP block had a significant reduction in their pain score at discharge compared with the placebo group (p = 0.017). There were no significant differences in the pain scores between groups at 24 h (95% CI 1.36-0.133, p = 0.237), 48 h (95% CI 0.689-0.465, p = 0.702) and 72 h (95% CI -0.631 to 0.223, p = 0.347). No differences were found between the groups regarding opioid requirements following the procedure (chi(2) = 3.62, p = 0.46). CONCLUSION: Although TAP block after a total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduced the pain score at discharge compared with placebo, its role in this setting is debatable due to the possible lack of clinical significance of the small difference found.",eng,1

The null hypothesis was there is no difference with respect to pain scores between ketorolac and iliac crest bupivacaine infusion as analgesic adjuncts to intravenous opioids. METHODS: A total of 54 children and adolescents (27 boys, 27 girls) undergoing alveolar cleft repair or Le Fort I osteotomy were assigned randomly in a prospective, single-blinded fashion to one of three groups: intravenous ketorolac plus iliac crest normal saline infusion, intravenous ketorolac plus iliac crest bupivacaine infusion, or iliac crest bupivacaine infusion alone. Iliac crest infusions and ketorolac were administered for 48 hours or until discharge, whichever occurred first. All patients received morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia device. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary outcome was pain score, and secondary outcomes were morphine consumption and satisfaction scores. RESULTS: Pain scores, morphine consumption, and satisfaction scores were not significantly different among groups. Estimated costs were significantly higher for bupivacaine infusion than intravenous ketorolac. CONCLUSIONS: Iliac crest donor-site pain is well managed in this patient population.

Therefore its use is suitable for surgery both superior and inferior to the umbilicus. Despite the encouraging initial results, there has yet to be any work demonstrating the comparative analgesic efficacy of OSTAP block with standard systemic opioids or epidural analgesia. Objective: We studied the efficacy of OSTAP block in providing intra- and post-operative analgesia in comparison to conventional intravenous (IV) morphine during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods: In this prospective, randomised and single-blind study, 34 adult patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under standard general anaesthesia received either bilateral OSTAP block using 1.5 mg/kg ropivacaine on each side (n=17) or IV morphine 0.1mg/kg (n=17). Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters (pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure) were recorded every five minutes. Repetitive boluses of IV fentanyl 0.5 mg/kg were given as rescue analgesic when any of the above-mentioned parameters rose more than 15% from the baseline values. Intraoperative fentanyl requirements and time to extubation were documented. Additional boluses of IV morphine 0.05mg/kg were administered in recovery room if the recorded visual analogue scale (VAS) score was more than 4. VAS score, nausea and vomiting score, sedation score as well as postoperative morphine requirements were recorded. Results: The morphine group required more rescue fentanyl in contrast to the OSTAP block group but the difference was not significant statistically [mean (SD) 34.4 (41.04) vs 22.4 (27.73) mg; p=0.323]. Time to extubation was significantly shorter in the OSTAP block group [mean (SD) 10.4(2.79) vs 12.5(2.70) min; p=0.030]. Both methods delivered an excellent analgesia [median VAS score (IQR) 2(2)] and did not differ in postoperative morphine consumptions. The morphine group demonstrated a higher sedation score [median sedation score (IQR) 1(1) vs 0(1); p=0.320] as well as incidence of nausea and vomiting (35.3% vs 11.8%; p=0.225). However, these between-group differences failed to show any statistical significance. There were no complications attributable to the OSTAP block. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided OSTAP block is as efficacious as IV morphine in providing effective analgesia during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore it can be introduced as a component of a multimodal analgesic regimen. The shorter time to extubation in the former method may be an advantage in ambulatory care.",English,0

Pediatric patients can be mobilized earlier if postoperative pain is minimized. In this study, two different regional anesthetic techniques, retrobulbar block and local infiltration, were compared with a no block"" control group for the postoperative management of pain in pediatric patients undergoing elective strabismus surgery. METHODS: Thirty patients were randomly allocated to one of the study groups: group 1 (n=10) control, group 2 (n=10) retrobulbar block, and group 3 (n=10) subconjunctival bupivacaine infiltration. The parameters that were evaluated during the early postoperative period (6 hours) were circulatory, pain scores by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Modified Pediatric Objective Pain Scale (MPOPS), additional analgesic requirement, nausea, and vomiting. The parameters that were evaluated after discharge from the hospital (on postoperative days 1 and 2) through questionnaires were additional analgesic requirement, nausea, vomiting, sleep disturbances, activity, and appetite. RESULTS: Group 3 had significantly higher VAS and MPOPS scores at postoperative 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes than groups 1 and 2 (P < .05). Patients in group 2 seemed to have a higher incidence of nausea and vomiting both in the early (6 hours) and late postoperative (postoperative days 1 and 2) periods; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Group 2 required less analgesic compared with groups 1 and 3 during the late postoperative period. Late postoperative activity and appetite were better in groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: Because there was no significant difference in terms of postoperative analgesia in the retrobulbar block or subconjunctival local anesthetic infiltration groups compared with the control group, we suggest that conventional methods of pain treatment are adequate for postoperative analgesia in strabismus surgery.""",eng,1

METHODS: After receiving hospital ethical committee approval and informed patient consents, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-III patients aged 18-80 were enrolled in the study. Standard anesthesia monitoring was applied to all patients. After premedication, spinal anesthesia was administered to all patients with 3.5 mL heavy bupivacaine at the L3-L4 subarachnoid space. Patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group I (n = 32) received a placebo block with 20 mL saline, Group II (n = 32) received semi-blind TAP block with 0.25% bupivacaine in 20 mL with a blunt regional anesthesia needle into the neurofascial plane via the lumbar triangle of Petit near the midaxillary line before fascial closure. At the end of the operation, intravenous (IV) dexketoprofen was given to all patients. The verbal analog scale (VAS) was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. Paracetamol IV was given to patients if their VAS score > 3. A rescue analgesic of 0.05 mg/kg morphine IV was applied if VA S > 3. Total analgesic consumption and morphine requirement in 24 hours were recorded. RESULTS: TAP block reduced VAS scores at all postoperative time points (P < 0.001).

Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 45 patients (ASA II-III) undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy for lung resection were randomized to one of three groups: group 1 received 0.5% bupivacaine and adrenaline 1/200,000 (B+E) 8 ml through a thoracic extradural catheter (tip T3-T5) 30 min before skin incision and saline 8 ml 15 min after skin incision; group 2 received saline 8 ml extradurally before incision and B+E 8 ml after incision; group 3 received saline 8 ml extradurally before and after incision. General anaesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol, alfentanil and atracurium. The alfentanil infusion was stopped before chest closure and fentanyl 50 micrograms in saline 10 ml was given extradurally. Patient-controlled extradural analgesia (PCEA) was commenced with 0.125% bupivacaine, adrenaline 1/400,000 and fentanyl 6 micrograms ml-1 (continuous rate of 2 ml h-1 and supplementary doses of 0.5 ml per 6 min). Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (recorded at rest, on mobilization and after cough), verbal rating scale (VRS) (recorded at rest), number of successful PCEA demands and complications were measured during the first 48 h after operation. There was no significant difference between groups, either in PCEA requirements (P > 0.21) or in VAS scores (either at rest, during mobilization of the ipsilateral arm of surgery or after cough). No significant differences between groups were found in the VRS. Thoracic extradural block with bupivacaine did not produce an early preemptive effect after thoracotomy.",eng,1

Paravertebral somatic nerve blocks (PVB) have the potential to offer unilateral abdominal wall anesthesia and long-lasting pain relief with minimal side effects. We compared PVB with peripheral neural blocks for outpatient IH. METHODS: Forty-six patients scheduled for IH were entered into this prospective, single-blind study. All patients underwent a standardized general anesthetic. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a PVB (levels T10-L2) preoperatively (n = 24) or an intraoperative peripheral block (PB) by the surgeon (n = 22), using 0.5% ropivacaine (40 mL). Opioid use, verbal analog pain scores, and side effects were documented for 72 hours. RESULTS: The use of opioids during surgery was less for the PVB group 162 +/- 70 mg than the PB group, 210 +/- 60 (P =.02). Need for opioids in PACU was less for the PVB group (39%) than the PB group (61%) (P =.002). Time until first pain after discharge was not different between groups, 312 +/- 446 minutes (PB) and 425 +/- 384 minutes (PVB) (P =.12). Of the PVB patients, 29% used no opioids at all compared with 18% of PB patients (P =.12). Mean time until first oxycodone use was similar between groups, 303 +/- 469 minutes (PB) and 295 +/- 225 minutes (PVB) (P =.18). Oxycodone use was also similar; 35 +/- 34 mg (PVB) versus 49 +/- 42 mg (PB) (P =.30). More patients in the PB group (50%) required antiemetic treatment in the postanesthesia care unit than the PVB group (21%) (P <.001). Side effects were similar at all other measurements. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PVB provides analgesia equivalent to extensive peripheral nerve block for inguinal herniorrhaphy, offering an alternative method of postoperative pain management and perhaps fewer side effects.",eng,0

Thirty subjects randomly received an inferior alveolar nerve block using 1 of the 2 solutions at 2 separate appointments using a repeated-measures design. Mandibular anterior and posterior teeth were blindly pulp tested at 4-minute cycles for 60 minutes postinjection. No response from the subject to the maximum output (80 reading) of the pulp tester was used as the criterion for pulpal anesthesia. Anesthesia was considered successful when 2 consecutive readings of 80 were obtained. A postoperative survey was used to measure pain and trismus. The results demonstrated 100% of the subjects had profound lip numbness with both solutions for inferior alveolar nerve blocks. The anesthetic success rates for individual teeth ranged from 20 to 80%. There were no significant differences (P > .05) between the 2 solutions. However, the combination lidocaine/hyaluronidase solution resulted in a significant increase in postoperative pain and trismus. It was concluded that adding hyaluronidase to a buffered lidocaine solution with epinephrine did not statistically increase the incidence of pulpal anesthesia in inferior alveolar nerve blocks and, because of its potential tissue damaging effect, it should not be added to local anesthetic solutions for inferior alveolar nerve blocks.",eng,0

Goga,2011.0,Mandibular nerve block can improve intraoperative inferior alveolar nerve visualization during sagittal split mandibular osteotomy,10.1016/j.jcms.2010.04.015,"INTRODUCTION: The main procedure specific complication of sagittal split osteotomy of the mandibular ramus (SSOMR) is inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) injury. This can be produced by poor intraoperative visibility of the IAN due to bone bleeding. In our centre, mandibular nerve blocks (MNBs) are usually performed for intra- and post-operative analgesia. We observed that MNB seems to decrease intraoperative bleeding and thus to improve IAN visibility. Our study was performed to evaluate the effect of MNB on intraoperative bleeding during SSOMR and, secondarily, on the duration of this procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients scheduled for bilateral SSOMR under general anaesthesia were prospectively randomized into two groups. The Block group received bilateral MNB (5 mL ropivacaine 0.5% for each block) and the Control group sham MNBs (bilateral cutaneous puncture, without block). The operations were carried out under a standardised general anaesthetic. Post-operatively, the surgeon, blinded to group allocation, assessed intraoperative bone bleeding using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (0: no bleeding, perfect visibility to 100: major bleeding, no visibility). Osteotomy duration, intraoperative anaesthetic requirements, and pain score in the recovery room were also recorded. Results are expressed as median [25-75th percentiles]. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included in each group. Osteotomy under MNB had a decreased intraoperative bone bleeding score compared with controls (20 [0-40] versus 55 [20-80], p=0.0002). They had a dry surgical field more frequently (29% versus 5%, p=0.01), and a shorter mean time for the osteotomy (15 [12.25-17.75] versus 17.5 [15-21]min, p=0.009). Block patients had reduced intraoperative opioid consumption (770 [678-1430] versus 2310 [1908-3058]mcg of remifentanil, p=0.0001), and lower pain scores in the recovery room (0 [0-2] versus 3 [1-5], p=0.12). CONCLUSION: MNB decreases intraoperative bone bleeding during SSOMR under general anaesthesia. Three hypotheses to explain this result are discussed.",eng,0

The secondary objectives measured postoperative pain, length of stay, and narcotic use. STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized, single-blinded trial of TAP block versus no block on women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy. TAP block patients received 20 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 placed under ultrasound guidance on each side. The outcomes were measured using validated quality of recovery questionnaires (QoR-40), visual analog scales (VAS) for pain, and documented narcotic use in the electronic medical record. RESULTS: In 58 women, no differences in demographics were noted between groups. Comparisons of pain and recovery between the 2 groups showed no differences. There was no decrease in narcotic use or length of stay among those who received the TAP block. CONCLUSIONS: TAP block does not improve postoperative QoR-40 scores or VAS pain scores following laparoscopic hysterectomy, nor does it decrease narcotic pain medication use.",eng,1

METHODS: Citations from 2000 to 2010 were included regarding the following aspects: selection of ganglia level for VTS, comparison of different techniques for VTS, evaluating clinical efficacy of intraoperative intrapleural analgesia, and postoperative intrapleural drainage. Major clinical outcomes are defined as: cases with postoperative resolution of symptoms, total cases with postoperative compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH), cases with severe or moderate CH, satisfied cases, evaluation of postoperative pain, and postoperative pneumothorax. RESULTS: Systemic review indicates that T3 and T3-4 sympathectomy had the best"" clinical efficacy. Meta-analysis suggests that efficacious rates of PH are nearly similar compared with multiple and single ganglia sympathectomy (100 vs. 95.6%). However, single-ganglia sympathectomy can render a lower risk of total CH compared with multiple-ganglia block. Risk of moderate/severe CH has a similar trend. Additionally, single-ganglia sympathectomy is more potent to satisfy patients postoperatively. One randomized, controlled trial (RCT) that compared different techniques for VTS indicated that the overall success rate of the operation was 95% and the differences were not statistically significant. Two RCTs indicated that there were significant differences between trial group (intraoperative intercostal nerve blocks using bupivacaine) and control group regarding the attenuation of postoperative pain. One RCT suggested that there was no significant difference with or without pleural drainage regarding the incidence of postoperative residual pneumothorax. CONCLUSIONS: T3 sympathectomy is supposed to be recommended for the treatment of PH regardless of using various techniques. Intraoperative intrapleural analgesia using bupivacaine or bupivacaine plus epinephrine is effective to prevent postoperative pain. Pleural drainage after VTS should be abandoned.""",eng,0

The patients completed a demographic survey and visual analog pain scales for pain prior to and at several time points after the procedure. Data regarding the need for additional pain medications postoperatively were recorded. Analysis of variance single factor and two-sample one-sided t test were used in data analysis. RESULTS: Experimental and control groups were similar in all measured demographic characteristics. They were also similar in gestational age, number of laminaria required, preoperative dilation, operative time, estimated blood loss and reported complications. Postoperative pain was not significantly affected by placement of a paracervical block prior to abortion under general anesthesia. The need for postoperative pain medication during recovery was similar between groups.

This randomized controlled double-blinded trial investigated the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks for laparoscopic gastric-bypass surgery. Methods: Seventy patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric-bypass surgery were randomized to receive either bilateral ultrasound-guided subcostal TAP block injections after induction of general anesthesia or none. All patients received trocar insertion site local anesthetic infiltration and systemic analgesia. The primary outcome was cumulative opioid consumption (IV morphine equivalent) during the first 24 h postoperatively. Interval opioid consumption, pain severity scores, rates of nausea or vomiting, and rates of pruritus were measured during phase I recovery, and at 24 and 48 h postoperatively. Results: There was no difference in cumulative opioid consumption during the first 24 h postoperatively between the TAP (32.2 mg [95% CI, 27.6-36.7]) and control (35.6 mg [95% CI, 28.6-42.5]; P = 0.41) groups. Postoperative opioid consumptions during phase I recovery and the 24-48-h interval were similar between groups, as were pain scores at rest and with movement during all measured intervals.

METHODS: VIU for urethral stricture can be performed under various types of anesthesia, including topical anesthesia. Although recent studies have shown that ICSB and general anesthesia have comparable efficacy for performing VIU, no studies have compared ICSB with topical anesthesia. Forty consenting patients with single, short, passable anterior urethral stricture were randomized into two groups. Group 1 patients received topical 2% lignocaine jelly and group 2 patients received 1% lignocaine ICSB for undergoing VIU. Pain perception during and after the procedure was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS). The changes in vital parameters during the procedure and procedure-related complications were recorded. Statistical analysis was done using the Mann-Whitney test or t test. RESULTS: The mean+/-standard deviation VAS scores intraoperatively (2.85+/-1.34) and at 1-hour postoperatively (1.17+/-0.96) were significantly lower (P<01) in group 2 patients than the corresponding scores in group 1 (4.9+/-1.9 and 2.35+/-1.34 respectively). The intraoperative rise in pulse rate and in blood pressure were significantly greater (P<.05) in group 1 patients (13+/-5.1/min and 11.3+/-6.44 mm Hg) than in group 2 (8.05+/-5.54/min and 6.35+/-5.86 mm Hg).

In this study, we assessed the efficacy of scalp block for decreasing postoperative pain in brain surgery. Thirty patients scheduled for supratentorial craniotomy were enrolled. They were randomly divided into two groups: Ropivacaine (scalp block with 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.75%) and Saline (scalp block with 20 mL of saline 0.9%). Anesthesia was standardized. The scalp block was performed after skin closure and before awakening. Postoperative pain was assessed at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 48 h by using a 10-cm visual analog scale. Analgesia was provided with sub- cutaneous codeine as requested by the patient. Average visual analog scale scores were higher in the Saline group as compared with Ropivacaine (3.7 +/- 2.4 vs 2.0 +/- 1.6; P = 0.036). The total dose of codeine did not differ, nor did the duration of time before the first dose of codeine was required in the Ropivacaine (571 +/- 765 min) versus Saline (319 +/- 409 min; P = 0.17) group. In conclusion, we found that postoperative scalp block decreases the severity of pain after craniotomy and that this effect is long lasting, possibly through a preemptive mechanism.

Methods: Forty-one subjects (age: 2-13 years) undergoing circumcision with Plastibell were randomly divided into LT and DPNB groups. Inhalation induction was performed with an 8% end-tidal sevoflurane concentration. In the LT group, a eutectic ointment of 5% lidocaine and 5% prilocaine was applied to the foreskin 1 h before surgery.

The LT group showed a higher pain score at 1 h after surgery than the DPNB group, whereas the DPNB group had a higher incidence of hematoma (p = 0.02) at 24 h after surgery. Conclusion: Anesthesia with 5% lidocaine and 5% prilocaine cream during circumcision of older children with Plastibell under general anesthesia with sevoflurane does not provide satisfactory perioperative hemodynamic stability or postoperative analgesia. 2012 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company.

The lack of studies in the maxillofacial literature on regional analgesia for rib harvests stimulated this study design. This study compared ropivacaine with bupivacaine in providing postoperative analgesia after rib harvest. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who needed rib grafting for maxillofacial reconstructive procedures were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups with different modalities of anesthesia against a control group. A catheter was embedded in the rib donor site in all patients. Patients in group A received 0.75% ropivacaine, those in group B received 0.5% bupivacaine, and those in croup C patients received normal saline and served as the controls. The outcome variables were the subjective and objective pain scores, the duration of action, and the efficacy of the drugs after rib harvest. Dependent variables were the need for a rescue analgesic by the patient and the duration of hospital stay. The subjective intensity of pain at rest was calculated using the visual analog scale. The objective pain scores at function were evaluated by comparing preoperative with postoperative values of incentive spirometry, breath-holding test, maximal chest expansion, and match-blowing test. The t test and paired samples test were used to the analyze data, and a P value less than .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were enrolled in this study. Patients in groups A and B showed significant pain relief compared with group C. Patients in group A showed significantly less pain at rest (2.8+/-0.894) compared with those in group B (3.7+/-0.875; P<.05). Patients in group A also showed significantly less in pain at function (3.8+/-0.894) compared with those in group B (4.7+/-0.923; P<.05). Patients in group A showed a minimal need for a rescue bolus compared with those in group B. The duration of action for ropivacaine was longer by a mean difference of 11 hours. No noteworthy difference was seen for the duration of stay in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The use of catheter-based analgesia after rib harvesting provides excellent postoperative comfort, with ropivacaine providing an earlier return to normal function compared with bupivacaine. The duration of action of ropivacaine was significantly longer and, hence, decreased the need for rescue analgesics.",eng,0

A systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1093/bja/aes279,"The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a field block that provides postoperative analgesia for abdominal surgery. Its analgesic utility after Caesarean delivery (CD) remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines whether TAP block can reduce i.v. morphine consumption in the first 24 h after CD. The authors retrieved randomized controlled trials comparing TAP block with placebo in CD. Postoperative i.v. morphine consumption during the first 24 h was selected as a primary outcome. Pain scores and both maternal and neonatal opioid-related side-effects were secondary outcomes. Where possible, meta-analytic techniques and random effects modelling were used to combine data. Trials were stratified based on whether or not spinal morphine was used as part of the analgesic regimen. Five trials including 312 patients were identified. TAP block reduced the mean 24 h i.v. morphine consumption by 24 mg [95% confidence interval (CI) -39.65 to -7.78] when spinal morphine was not used. TAP block also reduced visual analogue scale pain scores (10 cm line where 0 cm, no pain, and 10 cm, worst pain) by 0.8 cm (95% CI -1.53 to -0.05, P=0.01), and decreased the incidence of opioid-related side-effects. The differences in primary and secondary outcomes were not significant when spinal morphine was used. TAP block provides superior analgesia compared with placebo and can reduce the first 24 h morphine consumption in the setting of a multimodal analgesic regimen that excludes spinal morphine. TAP block can provide effective analgesia when spinal morphine is contraindicated or not used.",eng,1

Curatolo,2005.0,Single-injection thoracic paravertebral block for postoperative pain treatment after thoracoscopic surgery,10.1093/bja/aei250,"BACKGROUND: Thoracoscopic surgery can be associated with considerable postoperative pain. While the benefits of paravertebral block on pain after thoracotomy have been demonstrated, no investigations on the effects of paravertebral block on pain after thoracoscopy have been conducted. We tested the hypothesis that a single-injection thoracic paravertebral block, performed preoperatively, reduces pain scores after thoracoscopic surgery. METHODS: Of 45 patients recruited, 40 completed the study. They were randomly allocated to two groups: the paravertebral group received i.v. patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine plus single-injection thoracic paravertebral block with bupivacaine 0.375% and adrenaline 1:200 000 0.4 ml kg(-1) (n=20). The control group was treated with a back puncture without injection and morphine PCA (n=20). RESULTS: The main outcomes recorded during 48 h after surgery were pain scores using the visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100). Secondary outcomes were cumulative morphine consumption and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Half an hour and 24 h after surgery, median (25th-75th percentiles) VAS on coughing in the paravertebral group was 31.0 (20.0-55.0) and 30.5 (17.5-40.0) respectively and in the control group it was 70.0 (30.0-100.0) and 50.0 (25.0-75.0) respectively. The difference between the groups over the whole observation period was statistically significant (P<0.05). Twenty-four and 48 h after surgery, median (25th-75th percentiles) cumulative morphine consumption (mg) was 49.0 (38.3-87.0) and 69.3 (38.8-118.5) respectively in the paravertebral group and 51.2 (36.0-84.1) and 78.1 (38.4-93.1) in the control group (statistically not significant). No differences were found in PEFR or the incidence of any side-effects between groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that single-shot preoperative paravertebral block improves post-operative pain treatment after thoracoscopic surgery in a clinically significant fashion.",eng,1

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825365/pdf/jcvtr-4-65.pdf","Introduction: Postoperative pain as an important medical concern is usually treated by opioids which also are of various inevitable side effects. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of multimodal preincisional premedication on preventing post-cholecystectomy acute pain. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, sixty patients undergoing open cholecystectomy were randomized into two groups. Before anesthesia induction, Diclofenac suppository (100 mg) and oral Clonidine (0.2 mg) were administered in the first group. Immediately before operation, patients received Ketamine (1 mg/kg IV) while the control group received placebo. The site of incision was infiltrated by the surgeon with 20 mL Bupivacaine 0.25% in both groups. Anesthesia induction and maintenance were similar in both groups. The severity of pain was recorded 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after operation according to Visual Analogue Scale. Results: The severity of pain at two defined stages (6 and 12 hours later) was significantly less in the intervention group than the control group (P<0.005). The average pain severity score was less than the control group (P<0.005). Conclusion: In our study, the administration of Clonidine, Diclofenac and Ketamine and bupivacaine infiltration to the site of incision, altogether was associated with a significant decrease in pain score and opioid requirement after cholecystectomy in comparison to bupivacaine infiltration to the site of incision. 2012 by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.",English,0

DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: A tertiary care hospital in Hamilton, Ont. PATIENTS: Fifty patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Day-surgery patients had the choice of staying overnight for discharge the following day. They were compared with a control group of 47 patients who had laparoscopic cholecystectomy but did not receive bupivacaine. INTERVENTION: Instillation of 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine into laparoscopic cholecystectomy port sites intraoperatively before closure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores assessed 4 times postoperatively, the choice of patients to leave hospital the same day or to remain in the hospital overnight; the level of postoperative narcotic usage. MAIN RESULTS: Mean VAS pain scores (range 0 [no pain] to 5 [severe pain]) at less than 2 hours and at 6 hours after surgery were 2.9 and 2.9, respectively, in the bupivacaine group compared with 4.5 and 4.0, respectively, in the control group (p = 0.001 and 0.025). VAS scores at 10 hours postoperatively and the next morning did not differ between the groups. More patients in the bupivacaine group elected to go home on the day of surgery (p = 0.034). Narcotic usage was not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Instillation of bupivacaine into port sites should be standard practice for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",eng,0

During surgery, all patients received a light general anaesthesia with thiopentone, alfentanil and nitrous oxide in oxygen. After induction of general anaesthesia, patients were allocated randomly to receive an inguinal field block with lignocaine, either 15 min before operation or immediately after operation, after closure of the surgical wound, but before the patients were awake. Pain score on a visual analogue scale and on a verbal scale at rest, during mobilization from supine into sitting position and during cough was assessed 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h, and 7 days after operation. No significant differences between the groups were observed in VAS scores or verbal pain scores during rest or ambulation at any time. There was no significant difference in time to first request for morphine or total morphine consumption. These results do not show pre-emptive analgesia with a conventional inguinal field block to be of clinical importance compared with a similar block administered after operation.",eng,0

A topical review,10.1111/j.1399-6576.2010.02215.x,"The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a newly described peripheral block involving the nerves of the anterior abdominal wall. The block has been developed for post-operative pain control after gynaecologic and abdominal surgery. The initial technique described the lumbar triangle of Petit as the landmark used to access the TAP in order to facilitate the deposition of local anaesthetic solution in the neurovascular plane. Other techniques include ultrasound-guided access to the neurovascular plane via the mid-axillary line between the iliac crest and the costal margin, and a subcostal access termed the 'oblique subcostal' access. A systematic search of the literature identified a total of seven randomized clinical trials investigating the effect of TAP block on post-operative pain, including a total of 364 patients, of whom 180 received TAP blockade. The surgical procedures included large bowel resection with a midline abdominal incision, caesarean delivery via the Pfannenstiel incision, abdominal hysterectomy via a transverse lower abdominal wall incision, open appendectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Overall, the results are encouraging and most studies have demonstrated clinically significant reductions of post-operative opioid requirements and pain, as well as some effects on opioid-related side effects (sedation and post-operative nausea and vomiting). Further studies are warranted to support the findings of the primary published trials and to establish general recommendations for the use of a TAP block.",eng,1

Brull,2013.0,Duration of analgesic effectiveness after the posterior and lateral transversus abdominis plane block techniques for transverse lower abdominal incisions: a meta-analysis,10.1093/bja/aet214,"BACKGROUND: Both posterior and lateral transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block techniques provide effective early (0-12 h) postoperative analgesia after transverse incision surgery. However, whether either technique produces prolonged analgesia lasting beyond 12 h remains controversial. This meta-analysis examines the duration of analgesia associated with posterior and lateral TAP blocks in the first 48 h after lower abdominal transverse incision surgery. METHODS: We retrieved randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the analgesic effects of TAP block compared with control in patients undergoing lower abdominal transverse incision surgery. Outcomes sought included interval postoperative i.v. morphine consumption and also rest and dynamic pain scores at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postoperatively. Opioid-related side-effects and patient satisfaction at 24 and 48 h were also assessed. The 12-24 h interval morphine consumption was designated as a primary outcome. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs including 641 patients were analysed. Four trials examined the posterior technique and eight assessed the lateral technique. Compared with control, the posterior TAP block reduced postoperative morphine consumption during the 12-24 h and 24-48 h intervals by 9.1 mg (95% CI: -16.83, -1.45; P=0.02) and 5 mg (95% CI: -9.54, -0.52; P=0.03), respectively. It also reduced rest pain scores at 24, 36, and 48 h, and also dynamic pain scores at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Differences were not significant with the lateral TAP block. CONCLUSION: Based on the comparisons with control, the posterior TAP block appears to produce more prolonged analgesia than the lateral TAP block. Future RCTs comparing these two techniques are required to confirm our findings.",eng,1

METHODS: In this randomized controlled and double-blind study, 30 patients scheduled for infratentorial or occipital craniotomy were divided randomly into two groups: group morphine (morphine 0.1 mg.kg(-)(1) iv after dural closure and a SCPB performed with 20 mL of 0.9% saline at the end of the surgery) or group block (10 mL of 0.9% saline iv instead of morphine after dural closure and a SCPB performed with 20 mL of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% bupivacaine and 2% lidocaine at the end of the surgery). Postoperative pain was assessed at one, two, four, eight, 12, 16, and 24 hr using an 11-point (0-10) numerical rating scale (NRS). Analgesia was provided with subcutaneous codeine. RESULTS: Average NRS scores were similar between the two groups at each time interval over the study period. The average scores (with 95% confidence interval) were 3.9 (3.4-4.4) and 4.3 (3.8-4.9) for the block and morphine groups, respectively (P = 0.25). The delay before administration of the first dose of codeine was not statistically different between the two groups: 25 min (5-2,880) vs 21.5 min (5-90), median and range for the block and morphine groups, respectively. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was similar between the two groups.

METHODS: Forty-five pediatric patients aged below five undergoing cleft palate repair were randomly allocated to three groups of 15 each. After tracheal intubation, Group NB received no block for control, group S received 0.5 ml of normal saline and group B received 0.5 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine for palatal block. Postoperative pain score, the time to first demand of analgesia and number of rescue analgesic demands were noted. Finally, the parental satisfaction was graded. RESULTS: The block had no anesthetic sparing effect. The mean pain scores were significantly lower in patients who received block than in the group NB. The mean area under curve for FLACC score in group NB was 29 with 95% CI of 25-32, group S was 15 with 95% CI of 8.9-22.3 and in group B, it was 10 with 95% CI of 6-14.

METHODS: We prospectively recruited 162 patients who underwent elective thyroid operations from March 2006 to October 2007. They were randomly assigned to receive a bilateral superficial cervical block (12 ml per side) with isotonic saline (group A; n = 56), bupivacaine 0.5% (group B; n = 52), or levobupivacaine 0.5% (group C; n = 54) after induction of general anesthesia. The analgesic efficacy of the block was assessed with: intraoperative anesthetics (desflurane), numbers of patients needing postoperative analgesics, the time to the first analgesics required, and pain intensity by visual analog scale (VAS). Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for 24 h were also assessed by the PONV grade."" We also compared hospital stay, operative time, and discomfort in swallowing. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in patient characteristics. Each average end-tidal desflurane concentration was 5.8, 3.9, and 3.8% in groups A, B, and C, respectively (p < 0.001). Fewer patients in groups B and C required analgesics (A: B: C = 33:8:7; p < 0.001), and it took longer before the first analgesic dose was needed postoperatively (group A: B: C = 82.1:360.8:410.1 min; p < 0.001). Postoperative pain VAS were lower in groups B and C for the first 24 h postoperatively (p < 0.001). Incidences of overall and severe PONV were lower, however, there were not sufficient numbers of patients to detect differences in PONV among the three groups. Hospital stay was shorter in group B and group C (p = 0.011). There was no significant difference in operative time and postoperative swallowing pain among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral superficial cervical plexus block reduces general anesthetics required during thyroidectomy. It also significantly lowers the severity of postoperative pain during the first 24 h and shortens the hospital stay.""",eng,1

We compared a continuous intra-articular infusion to a continuous interscalene block with ropivacaine for patients undergoing outpatient rotator cuff repair. METHODS: Seventeen patients were randomized to one of two groups: 1) interscalene block with 0.5% ropivacaine (40 mL) followed by a postoperative intra-articular infusion or; 2) interscalene block with 0.5% ropivacaine (40 mL) followed by a postoperative continuous interscalene infusion. Infusions were 0.2% ropivacaine at 10 mL x hr(-1) for both groups. Infusions were maintained for 48 hr. Patients were discharged on the day of surgery. Verbal analogue pain scores (VAS) and postoperative oxycodone consumption were measured for 48 hr. RESULTS: Eight patients (47%; four in each group) had side effects or logistical problems complicating care. The mean VAS scores at rest and with movement in the postanesthesia care unit and at 12 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr were not different (P > 0.1). Inadequate analgesia was reported in 50-75% of all study patients. Time until first oxycodone use was similar between groups 829 min +/- 432 (interscalene) and 999 min +/- 823 (intra-articular; P = 0.6). Total oxycodone consumption was also similar 49 mg +/- 48 and 59 mg +/- 51 (P = 0.7), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the difficulties of ambulatory interscalene and intra-articular infusion for rotator cuff surgery. The high VAS scores and need for additional medical care suggest that intra-articular administration may not be reasonable for this magnitude of surgery. Further refinement of the perineural local anesthetic infusion is necessary to consistently provide analgesia after ambulatory rotator cuff surgery.",eng,0

We compared the efficacy and side effects of intrathecal morphine with an ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial. The primary outcome was the morphine equivalents dose used in the first 24 h post-surgery. Secondary outcomes were pain scores and side effects, including pruritus, sedation, nausea and vomiting. METHODS: Planned recruitment was for 90 women; however, the study was terminated early. Sixty-nine women undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia were enrolled. They were randomized to receive either intrathecal morphine 100 mug plus a sham TAP block or a TAP block with 0.5% ropivacaine 1.5 mg/kg, to each side to a maximum of 20 mL. Women were assessed at 2, 6, 10, 24 h and 3 months post-spinal. RESULTS: Sixty-six women completed the trial. The morphine equivalents dose used in the TAP block group was greater at 24 h compared with the intrathecal morphine group (7.5 mg (95% CI 4.8-10.2) vs. 2.7 mg (95% CI 1.0-4.3), F [1, 64]=9.62, P=0.003). There was no difference at 2, 6, or 10 h. Pain scores on rest and movement were higher in the TAP block group at all times although this only reached statistical significance at 10 h (P=0.001). Nausea and vomiting (P=0.02) and pruritus (P=0.007) were lower in the TAP block group. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, the TAP block was associated with greater supplemental morphine requirements and higher pain scores than intrathecal morphine but fewer opioid-related side effects. The TAP block may be a reasonable alternative when intrathecal morphine is contraindicated or not appropriate.",eng,1

This was a randomized, single-blind investigation of 202 children aged 1-13 yr. Anaesthesia was induced with N2O/O2 and halothane or propofol and maintained with N2O/O2/halothane. Local anaesthesia included ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block plus subcutaneous injection by the surgeon of up to 0.3 ml.kg-1 bupivacaine 0.25% with 5 micrograms.kg-1 adrenaline. The dose for caudal anaesthesia was 1 ml.kg-1 up to 20 ml bupivacaine 0.2% with 5 micrograms.kg-1 adrenaline. Postoperative pain was assessed with mCHEOPS in the anaesthesia recovery room, with postoperative usage of opioid and acetaminophen in the hospital, and with parental assessment of pain with a VAS. Vomiting, time to first ambulation and first urination were recorded. The postoperative pain scores and opioid usage were similar; however, the LA-group required more acetaminophen in the Day Care Surgical Unit. The incidence of vomiting and the times to first ambulation and first urination were similar. The LA-patients had a shorter recovery room stay (40 +/- 9 vs 45 +/- 15 min, P < 0.02). The postoperative stay was prolonged in the CA group (176 +/- 32 vs 165 +/- 26 min, P = 0.02).

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: St. Joseph's Hospital, Hamilton, Ont., a tertiary care teaching centre. PATIENTS: Sixty-one patients booked for elective thoracotomy were randomized by scaled envelope to two groups. INTERVENTIONS: Group A received a continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block with bupivacaine 0.5% in 1:200,000 epinephrine as a bolus of 0.3 mL/kg followed by an infusion of 0.1 mL/kg every hour for 72 hours. Group B received a continuous lumbar epidural block with morphine as a bolus of 70 g/kg followed by an infusion of 7 g/kg every hour for 72 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain was assessed by a linear visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score. The cumulative amount of rescue"" intravenous morphine used, and serum bupivacaine concentrations were measured as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Pain control was the same in both groups as assessed by linear VAS score (p = 0.33). The cumulative dose of intravenous morphine for supplemental analgesia was statistically significant between the groups: group A patients used more morphine than group B (p < 0.05). Accumulation of serum bupivacaine was present with no clinical toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in the degree of post-thoracotomy pain control measured by the VAS score when analgesia is provided by continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block with bupivacaine 0.5% in 1:200,000 epinephrine or lumbar epidural block with morphine. Larger amounts of rescue analgesia were used by patients in the continuous extrapleural group with bupivacaine than those in the continuous lumbar epidural block with morphine.

However its value in the perioperative management of laparoscopic colorectal surgical patients is unclear and analgesic regimens vary. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of various analgesic regimes on outcomes following laparoscopic colectomy. METHOD: A systematic review of studies assessing analgesic regimes following laparoscopic colorectal resection was performed. The primary outcome of interest was length of hospital stay whilst the secondary outcomes included pain, time to tolerate a normal diet, return of bowel function and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Eight studies were identified, five of which compared epidural vs patient controlled analgesia/intra-venous morphine. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of outcomes, except pain control which was superior in the epidural group. Spinal anaesthesia using intrathecal morphine in addition to local anaesthetic, and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have also been shown to reduce postoperative pain. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of data assessing the benefits of postoperative analgesic regimes following laparoscopic colorectal surgery and none of the protocols were shown to be clearly superior. Further studies, including the assessment of spinal analgesia are required to determine the most appropriate analgesic regime following laparoscopic colorectal surgery.",eng,1

Different treatment modalities are proposed. The aim of this review was to evaluate recent literature on different interventions to treat chronic inguinal pain after inguinal hernia repair and their outcomes. Methods: The Medline database, CINAHL, Embase, and Pubmed, including e-links to related articles, and the clinical trial registry of the Cochrane Collaboration were searched for relevant articles. Studies since 2001 reporting an intervention and their outcome to treat chronic postoperative inguinal pain in adult patients were selected. Study design, length of follow-up, number of included and evaluated patients, definition of chronic pain, description, as well as outcome of the intervention areextracted. Results: A total of 29 studies were included; eleven of them were prospective, the remaining retrospective. One study about pharmacological treatment (n=2), two studies about peripheral nerve blockage (n=9), three studies about pulsed radiofrequency (n=12), four studies about neurostimulation (n=7), one study about removal of staples or tackers (n=1), one study about neuroablation (n=10), and 17 studies about neurectomy (n=733) were included. Conclusions: This collective review shows the broad spectrum of interventions to treat chronic postoperative inguinal pain. Due to a wide range of pain definitions and outcome measurement a true comparison is difficult. 2012 Springer-Verlag.",English,1

Ilfeld,2009.0,Bilateral infraorbital nerve blocks decrease postoperative pain but do not reduce time to discharge following outpatient nasal surgery,10.1007/s12630-009-9119-5,"PURPOSE: While infraorbital nerve blocks have demonstrated analgesic benefits for pediatric nasal and facial plastic surgery, no studies to date have explored the effect of this regional anesthetic technique on adult postoperative recovery. We designed this study to test the hypothesis that infraorbital nerve blocks combined with a standardized general anesthetic decrease the duration of recovery following outpatient nasal surgery. METHODS: At a tertiary care university hospital, healthy adult subjects scheduled for outpatient nasal surgery were randomly assigned to receive bilateral infraorbital injections with either 0.5% bupivacaine (Group IOB) or normal saline (Group NS) using an intraoral technique immediately following induction of general anesthesia. All subjects underwent a standardized general anesthetic regimen and were transported to the recovery room following tracheal extubation. The primary outcome was the duration of recovery (minutes) from recovery room admission until actual discharge to home. Secondary outcomes included average and worst pain scores, nausea and vomiting, and supplemental opioid requirements. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled. A statistically significant difference in mean [SD] recovery room duration was not observed between Groups IOB and NS (131 [61] min vs 133 [58] min, respectively; P = 0.77). Subjects in Group IOB did experience a reduction in average pain on a 0-100 mm scale (mean [95% confidence interval]) compared to Group NS (-11 [-21 to 0], P = 0.047), but no other comparison of secondary outcomes was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: When added to a standardized general anesthetic, bilateral IOB do not decrease actual time to discharge following outpatient nasal surgery despite a beneficial effect on postoperative pain.",eng,1

METHODS: A prospective, randomised clinical trial was conducted on 52 eyes of 52 consecutive patients undergoing sub-Tenon's anaesthetic for cataract surgery. Eyes were randomly assigned to either 3 mL or 5 mL volume of anaesthetic solution (0.5% bupivacaine/2% lidocaine in a 50:50 mixture). The main outcome measures were akinesia 5 min post-administration of anaesthetic, changes in IOP immediately after and 5 min after anaesthetic administration, and patient pain perception during procedure. RESULTS: The level of kinesia was greater in the 3 mL group (n = 25) compared to the 5 mL group (n = 27) (P = 0.001, Mann-;Whitney U-test). There was no significant difference in pain perception between the two groups (P = 0.464, student t-test). Although there was great variation in IOP changes following sub-Tenon's anaesthetic, there was a trend for a larger rise in mean IOP immediately after anaesthetic administration in the 5 mL group (mean +/- SD +5.6 +/- 4.2 mmHg) compared to the 3 mL group (+4.3 +/- 3.8 mmHg), but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.25, student t-test).

Journal Article,D. K. Baidya; P. Khanna; S. Maitra,2014.0,Analgesic efficacy and safety of thoracic paravertebral and epidural analgesia for thoracic surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivt551,"Though once considered the gold standard, epidural anaesthesia has complications that may be significant and include hypotension, urinary retention, partial or patchy block and, in rare cases, devastating neurological injuries also. Paravertebral block (PVB) is an alternative technique for unilateral surgical procedures like thoracotomy, which may offer similar analgesic effectiveness and a more favourable side-effect profile than epidural analgesia. This systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized clinical trials aims to compare thoracic paravertebral with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in thoracotomy for lung surgery. Five hundred and forty-one patients from 12 clinical trials have been included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. We found that visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at rest and during activity/coughing at 4-8, 24 and 48 h postoperatively were similar in both the PVB and TEA groups. Considering studies not included in the previous meta-analysis, a VAS score on activity at 48 h is significantly better in the PVB group (mean difference 0.40 cm; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.77, 0.02; Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) fixed). Hypotension (odds ratio 0.13; 95% CI 0.06, 0.31; M-H fixed) and urinary retention are more common in the epidural analgesia group. So, we conclude that thoracic PVB may be as effective as thoracic epidural analgesia for post-thoracotomy pain relief and is also associated with fewer complications. The Author 2014.

Ideal methods should have a high success rate, with easy implementation and minimal complications. Debate exists over the optimal pain control method. This randomized trial was designed to compare epidural (EPI) and intercostal nerve catheter with patient-controlled analgesia (ICN-PCA) for pain control after thoracotomy. METHODS: The study included 124 randomized patients; 91 had sufficient data for analysis (44 EPI, 47 ICN-PCA). The primary endpoint was pain measurement using a composite of a visual analogue scale, numerical rating, and categorical rating. A second endpoint was the success rate of each method. Pulmonary function tests, antibiotics, intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital days, and use of nonprotocol pain medications were also compared. RESULTS: There were 12 pain observations per patient (90% completed on days 1 to 5). The pain composite revealed an average postoperative pain score of 2.4 on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). There was no difference between the groups. Failures of the planned method of analgesia included 9 in the EPI group and 4 in the ICN group (p = 0.23). Another 20 patients were excluded (no difference between groups) due to unsuspected mediastinal metastases precluding thoracotomy (n = 13), and other miscellaneous factors precluding follow-up (n = 7). The EPI group had an increased number of urinary catheter days (2.5 days vs 1.7, p = 0.002) and increased narcotic supplements (p = 0.03) compared with ICN. Mean ICU days (0.9) and hospital days (6.2) were similar for both groups, and there were no differences in arrhythmias, pneumonias, transfusions, and antibiotic use. Significant differences were seen (p = 0.001) between preoperative and postoperative pulmonary function tests in both groups. However, there were no differences in pulmonary function when the groups were compared with each other. CONCLUSIONS: Satisfactory pain control was achieved after thoracotomy using either EPI or ICN-PCA. The ICN-PCA achieved equivalent pain control compared with EPI, and was placed by the surgeon with no delays in surgery, and demonstrated a decreased requirement for Foley catheter duration.",eng,1

Horn,2010.0,Indications and management of continuous infusion of local anesthetics at home,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACO.0b013e32833e27bc,Purpose of review: The review examines recent research activity in the field of continuous peripheral nerve blocks in the ambulatory setting and places it in context with regard to previous research efforts. Recent findings: Use of continuous peripheral nerve blocks at home following outpatient surgery is an increasingly accepted form of anesthesia practice. Researchers continue active investigation of optimal strategies for the relationship between continuous local anesthetic infusion volume and concentration as well as assisted and ideal catheter placement techniques including ultrasound. SUMMARY: Continuous peripheral nerve blockade at home offers good short-term control of postoperative pain in the outpatient setting. Long-term outcomes remain to be evaluated fully. More information is becoming available on local anesthetic volume and concentration relationships in both the upper and lower extremities - optimal strategies are not yet clear. Ultrasound may offer benefits in terms of speed and ease of continuous catheter placement while reducing the necessary number of needle passes required to reach the target structure site(s). 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.,English,0

Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of intercostal block in children following minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). METHODS: Forty-five patients given patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine postoperatively were studied. Twenty-six patients were given bilateral intercostal blocks after induction of anesthesia (PCA-IB group), and nineteen patients were retrospective controls without regional blockade (PCA group). All patients were followed up 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS: A loading dose of morphine (0,1+/-0,49 mg/kg) before starting PCA was used in seventeen patients in PCA group vs. no patient in PCA-IB group. Cumulative used morphine doses were lower up to 12 h after surgery in PCA-IB group (0,29+/-0,08 mug/kg) than in the PCA group (0,46+/-0,18 mug/kg), p<0,01. There were no differences in pain scores, oxygen saturation values, sedation scores, and the incidence of pulmonary adverse events between the two groups. There was a tendency towards less morphine-related adverse effects in PCA-IB group compared to PCA group (p<0,05). No complications related to the intercostal blocks were observed. CONCLUSION: Bilateral intercostal blocks following MIRPE are safe and easy to perform and can diminish postoperative opioid requirement.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized study. SETTING: Specialty research hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one consenting patients undergoing MIDCAB surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the TEA group had an epidural catheter inserted at the T4-5 interspace, whereas patients in the PVB group had a catheter inserted in the paravertebral space on the left side at the T4-5 level. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Parameters evaluated included visual analog scale pain scores at rest and while coughing, supplemental analgesic requirement, complications, hemodynamics, and respiratory parameters. Measurements were made at 2-hour intervals for 12 hours beginning at 10 minutes after endotracheal extubation. There was no statistically significant difference in visual analog scale scores and requirement of supplemental analgesia between the 2 groups. Cardiac index at 4 hours and 6 hours was significantly higher in the TEA group. Patients in the PVB group had significantly lower respiratory rates at 8, 10, and 12 hours. All other parameters were comparable. In 1 patient, the epidural space could not be catheterized. One patient in the TEA group had transient hypotension, and 1 patient complained of backache at the site of the epidural catheter insertion. CONCLUSION: PVB is as effective as TEA for postoperative analgesia after MIDCAB surgery. PVB is technically easier than TEA and may be safer than TEA because no complications were seen in the PVB group.",eng,1

We conducted this clinical trial to confirm the effectiveness of PVB after thoracotomy. METHODS: In this non-inferiority trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive PVB (n = 35) or EP (n = 35). The primary endpoint was the pain assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) at rest, 2, 24, and 48 h after thoracotomy, with the non-inferiority margin set at 15 mm. The secondary end points were the pain assessed using the VAS on exercising and on coughing, 2, 24, and 48 h after surgery, respectively, and the complications and need for additional analgesic agents. RESULTS: This trial revealed that PVB was not inferior to EP with respect to the primary end point: The mean VAS scores at rest, 2, 24, and 48 h after thoracotomy were 26.3, 10.8, and 8.3 mm in the PVB group and 23.6, 12.4, and 12.6 mm in the EP group, respectively (P < 0.01 for non-inferiority at all points). There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of complications or the need for additional analgesic agents.

Colic,2011.0,Transversus abdominis plane block anesthesia in abdominoplasties,10.1097/PRS.0b013e31821e6f51,"BACKGROUND: The transversus abdominis plane block is a promising approach to the provision of postoperative analgesia following abdominal incision. This effective method blocks the sensory nerve supply to the anterior abdominal wall. The authors evaluated its analgesic efficacy over the first 12 postoperative hours after abdominoplasty with liposculpture in a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. METHODS: Twenty-eight women undergoing abdominoplasty by means of a lower abdominal incision were randomized to undergo transversus abdominis plane block (n = 14) in addition to standard care therapy (n = 14). The investigators, who were blinded to the conditions of the study, assessed the patients in the postanesthesia care unit at 4, 6, and 12 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: The transversus abdominis plane block group reported reduced pain scores (F = 12.73, p < 0.001). Morphine requirement was also reduced in the first 12 postoperative hours (chi2 = 19.27; p < 0.005). Transversus abdominis plane block group patients also exhibited early ambulation compared with the control group (F = 65.15, p < 0.001). All of the patients in the transversus abdominis plane block group reported lower levels of pain with their postoperative analgesic regimen, which was demonstrated by their rates of recovery. The Mann-Whitney test was performed on the data, which illustrated that mean ranks consistently corresponded to the trend the authors predicted. CONCLUSIONS: The transversus abdominis plane block seems to hold considerable promise for patients undergoing abdominoplasty by providing effective postoperative analgesia in the first 12 postoperative hours after major abdominoplasty.

Adenosine is a metabolic intermediate that is involved in nearly all aspects of cell function, including neurotransmission and signal transduction.This study was aimed to show whether addition of adenosine to bupivacaine in ultrasound-guided ICB had an analgesic effect. Methods: Sixty adult patients were divided into two equal groups, each group included 30 patients. Group I received infraclavicular bupivacaine 0.325% in a volume of 30 ml. Group II received 30 ml of 0.325% bupivacaine + 12 mg adenosine. The block was maintained with an infusion of 10 ml/h. The following parameters were assessed: Success rate, time of the sensory onset, motor block, visual analog scale (VAS), and amount of i.v. pethidine needed. Results: This study showed an analgesic effect of infraclavicular adenosine as evidenced by a statistically significant shorter mean time of onset of the sensory block (16 vs. 20 min, P < 0.05), lower mean VAS score over 48 h (1.7 vs. 2.7, P < 0.05), longer mean time of first parenteral analgesic requirement (299 vs. 255 min, P < 0.05), and lower mean total dose of pethidine needed over 48 h after surgery (25.5 vs. 56.6 mg, P <0.05). All patients got successful infraclavicular block and recovered uneventfully without any sensory or motor deficit. Conclusion: Adenosine may provide valuable addition to the therapeutic options in anesthesia and pain management. Further research is required to figure out its exact role.",English,0

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Operating room of a university hospital. PATIENTS: 51 women undergoing elective Cesarean delivery with a combined spinal-epidural technique that included intrathecal morphine. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomized to receive a bilateral TAP block with 0.5% ropivacaine or 0.9% saline. Postoperative analgesics were administered on request and selected based on pain severity. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were evaluated at 2, 24, and 48 hours after the TAP blocks were performed. Verbal rating scale (VRS) pain scores at rest, with movement, and for colicky pain were recorded, as was analgesic consumption. Patients rated the severity of opioid side effects and their satisfaction with the procedure and analgesia. MAIN RESULTS: 51 subjects received TAP blocks with ropivacaine (n = 26) or saline (n = 25).

Respiratory studies comprising forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) and analysis of arterial blood gases were made. Bilateral i.c.b. given after surgery performed through a midline incision did not improve the respiratory function, whereas unilateral i.c.b. after surgery through a subcostal incision had positive effects. Thus postoperative i.c.b. following cholecystectomy performed through a subcostal incision resulted in higher FVC, FEV1 and PEF values than without i.c.b. at least during the time of effective nerve block. I.c.b. after subcostal incision also improved arterial oxygen tension. The patients undergoing cholecystectomy and receiving a second i.c.b. 8 h after the first one had better respiratory function than the patients without any block during the first 2 days postoperatively.",eng,1

The efficacy of an infraorbital nerve block vs intravenous fentanyl was compared in our prospective, randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Forty-six infants scheduled for primary cleft lip repair were prospectively randomized to one of two groups: group F that received 2 mcg x kg(-1) of fentanyl intravenously and an infraorbital nerve block with 0.5 ml on each side of preservative-free normal saline, and, group B that received bilateral infraorbital nerve blocks with 0.5 ml on each side of 0.25% bupivacaine and 2 ml of preservative-free saline solution intravenously after induction of anesthesia but prior to surgical incision. Patients were observed by a blinded observer for (i) pain scores using neonatal infant pain score; (ii) need for rescue medication in the anesthesia care unit (PACU), in the short stay unit (SSU) and at home and (iii) feeding parameters including difficulty in feeding, time to first feeding and volume of feeds in the PACU, SSU and at home. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in pain scores between the two groups over time (P = 0.98); there were no differences between groups in the number of rescue medications in the PACU, in the SSU as well as at home; however, the time to first rescue medication was greater in the block group compared with the fentanyl group (P = 0.07). There were no significant differences in feeding volumes between groups in the PACU (P = 0.46), SSU (P = 0.57) and at home (P = 0.15). There were no differences in time to initiate feeding between the two groups (P = 0.81). However, there was difficulty with feeding in the block groups compared with the fentanyl group (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The infraorbital nerve block can be effectively used for pain control in infants undergoing primary cleft lip repair. Although children undergoing a nerve block experienced minor difficulties in feeding, there were no differences in feeding volumes or other feeding parameters.

Recent studies have shown the simplicity and the efficacy of a transrectal approach for periprostatic nerve block. The goal of our study was to evaluate the effect of a transrectal periprostatic nerve block on the discomfort associated with rigid cystoscopy. A total of 73 patients underwent cystoscopy. Group 1 (n = 39) received a transrectal periprostatic lidocaine infiltration prior to the cystoscopy. Group 2 (n = 34) underwent cystoscopy alone. The pain that patients experienced during cystoscopy was assessed on a visual analog scale. The patients in the two groups were very similar in regard to age and size of the prostate. The mean pain score was 3.4 in group 1 and 3.9 in group 2. This difference was not statistically significant.

Based on our pilot initial results that reflected reduced postoperative pain, we conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to investigate whether the analgesia produced by bilateral pudendal nerve block using a nerve-stimulator could provide better postoperative pain relief compared with the routine technique in use in the Department of Anesthesia. METHODS: After Ethical Committee approval and informed consent, 100 patients scheduled for hemorrhoidectomy were randomized into control (C) and study (P) groups with 50 patients each. Bilateral pudendal nerve block with 0.25 percent bupivacaine was performed with nerve-stimulator. Evaluated parameters were pain severity, duration of analgesia, demand analgesia, and possible technique-related complications. Data were evaluated 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after surgery completion. The first defecation and patient satisfaction were recorded. RESULTS: Successful pudendal nerves stimulation was achieved in all patients in the study group. The pudendal nerve block group was found to have better postoperative pain relief, reduced need for analgesics, and patient satisfaction. Mean analgesic duration was 23.8 +/- 4.8 hours vs. 3.6 +/- 1 hours. All patients in the pudendal nerve block had spontaneous micturition vs. 48 patients in the control group. The pudendal analgesia was considered excellent by 44 patients and satisfactory by 6 male patients. The six male patients complained because of penile anesthesia. No anesthetic-related local or systemic complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In this controlled study, bilateral pudendal nerve block oriented by nerve stimulator provided excellent analgesia with low need for opioids, without local or systemic complications, and without urinary retention.",eng,1

All women had local anaesthetic infiltration at the site of port placement and, in addition, received multimodal post-operative analgesia. RESULTS: Sixty-one successive cases were included in the study: 20 had a TAP block and 41 were managed without any blocks. The groups were comparable with respect to age, body mass index, Eastern Co-operative Group performance status, type of operation, cancer status, surgical and anaesthetic time. Women with a TAP block had a significantly shorter length of stay (1.45 vs 2.20 days, P=0.014), lower total peri-operative and post-operative opioid use (12 vs 19 mg in morphine equivalents, P=0.014; 11 vs 21 mg, P=0.05) when compared with those without a TAP block. Multivariate analysis identified patient age and a TAP block with a shorter length of stay (P<0.001 and P=0.015, respectively). Total opioid use was only significantly correlated with a TAP block (P=0.005). There were no complications related to a TAP block.

Operative morbidity rates reduce by effective postoperative pain control. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the thoracic epidural blockade (TEB) and the paravertebral blockade (PVB) methods in relieving the pain caused by a thoracotomy incision. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 44 consecutive patients who underwent elective posterolateral thoracotomy. The patients were classed into two groups: TEB (n=19) and PVB (n=25). Patients in both the groups could self-control the infusion of bupivacaine infusion and diclofenac sodium. The groups were compared according to the parameters such as analgesic efficacy (VAS), respiratory function tests (forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and arterial blood gases), stress response (serum cortisol and glucose levels), adverse effects, necessity for additional analgesia, duration of catheter application procedure, mean hospital stay and postoperative follow-up. Results are analysed statistically by Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and a p-value of <0.05 was accepted to be statistically significant. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to age, gender, VAS, FEV(1), PEFR, serum cortisol and glucose levels, necessity for additional analgesia and hospital staying days. In contrast, adverse effects and duration of catheterisation were statistically significantly lower in group PVB (p=0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: PVB catheterisation can be easily performed and placed in a short span perioperatively. Therefore, it might be the preferred method over TEB which has a high incidence of adverse effects and complication rates.",eng,1

In addition, the need to include only those clinical studies that meet minimum standards for randomization and blinding must be adhered to. In this review, we have applied stringent clinical study design standards to identify publications on the use of perioperative local anesthetics. We first examined several types of peripheral nerve blocks, covering a variety of surgical procedures, and second, we examined the effects of intentionally administered IV local anesthetic (lidocaine) for suppression of postoperative pain. Thirdly, we have examined publications in which vascular concentrations of local anesthetics were measured at different times after peripheral nerve block procedures, noting the incidence when those levels reached ones achieved during intentional IV administration. Importantly, the very large number of studies using neuraxial blockade techniques (epidural, spinal) has not been included in this review but will be dealt with separately in a later review. The overall results showed a strongly positive effect of local anesthetics, by either route, for suppressing postoperative pain scores and analgesic (opiate) consumption. In only a few situations were the effects equivocal. Enhanced effectiveness with the addition of adjuvants was not uniformly apparent. The differential benefits between drug delivery before, during, or immediately after a surgical procedure are not obvious, and a general conclusion is that the significant antihyperalgesic effects occur when the local anesthetic is present during the acute postoperative period, and its presence during surgery is not essential for this action.",eng,1

However, no study has examined whether US can reduce the volume required when compared with nerve stimulation (NS) for ISB. Our aim was to do this by comparing the minimum effective analgesic volumes (MEAVs). METHODS: After ethics approval and informed consent, patients undergoing shoulder surgery were recruited to this randomized, double-blind, up-down sequential allocation study. The volume used for both US and NS was dependent upon the success or failure of the previous block. Success was defined as a verbal rating score of 0/10, 30 min after surgery. Ten needle passes were allowed before defaulting to the opposite group. Patients received general anaesthesia. Pain scores and analgesic consumption were assessed by a blinded observer. Statistical comparisons of continuous variables were performed using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. Categorical variables were analysed using chi(2) test. MEAV values were estimated using log-transformed up-down independent pairs analysis and probit regression. Significance was assumed at P<0.05 (two-sided). RESULTS: The MEAV required to provide effective analgesia was significantly (P=0.034) reduced to 0.9 ml [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-2.8] in the US group from 5.4 ml (95% CI 3.4-8.6) in the NS group. Fewer needle passes were needed to identify the brachial plexus with US (1 vs 3; P<0.0001) and patients had less pain at 30 min after surgery (P=0.03).

Thoracic epidural analgesia is commonly considered the gold standard"" in this setting; however, evaluation of the evidence is needed to assess the comparative benefits of alternative techniques, guide clinical practice and identify areas requiring further research. METHODS: In this systematic review of randomized trials we evaluated thoracic epidural, paravertebral, intrathecal, intercostal, and interpleural analgesic techniques, compared to each other and to systemic opioid analgesia, in adult thoracotomy. Postoperative pain, analgesic use, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Continuous paravertebral block was as effective as thoracic epidural analgesia with local anesthetic (LA) but was associated with a reduced incidence of hypotension. Paravertebral block reduced the incidence of pulmonary complications compared with systemic analgesia, whereas thoracic epidural analgesia did not. Thoracic epidural analgesia was superior to intrathecal and intercostal techniques, although these were superior to systemic analgesia; interpleural analgesia was inadequate. CONCLUSIONS: Either thoracic epidural analgesia with LA plus opioid or continuous paravertebral block with LA can be recommended. Where these techniques are not possible, or are contraindicated, intrathecal opioid or intercostal nerve block are recommended despite insufficient duration of analgesia, which requires the use of supplementary systemic analgesia. Quantitative meta-analyses were limited by heterogeneity in study design, and subject numbers were small. Further well designed studies are required to investigate the optimum components of the epidural solution and to rigorously evaluate the risks/benefits of continuous infusion paravertebral and intercostal techniques compared with thoracic epidural analgesia.""",eng,1

METHODS: We studied 43 patients undergoing vitreo-retinal surgery under general anaesthesia in a randomized double blind study. Patients received a standard general anaesthetic followed by a sub-Tenon's injection of 4-5 mL of either bupivacaine 0.75% or saline. We recorded intraoperative invasive arterial pressure, then the incidence and severity of pain and of nausea and vomiting, for 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS: In the sub-Tenon's bupivacaine group, there was a significant reduction in the perioperative opioid use and a reduction in the frequency of bradycardia and hypertensive episodes, defined as a rise > 25% of baseline for a duration of > 3 min. The sub-Tenon's bupivacaine group also had significantly lower pain scores and nausea scores at 12 h, concomitant with a lower consumption of analgesia and antiemetics. CONCLUSIONS: This local anaesthetic technique is effective in vitreo-retinal surgery and can be safely applied to this population of patients regardless of axial length.",eng,0

METHODS: Thirty-six patients undergoing arthroscopic elbow surgery under general anesthesia were randomized to either a study group receiving axillary nerve block (Ax group) or a control group receiving portal site injections of local anesthetic (Lo group). During the first 48 hours after surgery, pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores (0-100), total amount of oral analgesics required, and patient satisfaction were assessed. RESULTS: Among all 36 patients, mean pain VAS scores at rest were 37, 18, and 9 for the first 12-hour period and at 24 and 48 hours after surgery, respectively. The mean pain VAS scores during physiotherapy were 47 and 33 at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively, respectively. No intergroup differences were observed between the Ax and Lo groups at any time point after surgery (P value range, .41 to .87). The mean number of loxoprofen tablets required during the 48-hour study period was 5.1 in the Ax group and 4.5 in the Lo group (P = .90). The Ax and Lo groups had mean overall patient satisfaction scores of 91 and 91, respectively (P = .98). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative pain levels after arthroscopic elbow surgery could be well managed with oral analgesics and local anesthetic.

The aim of the current study was to compare the efficacy of continuous thoracic epidural analgesia (EDA) to continuous intercostal (IC) block for postoperative pain and pulmonary function in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial. METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing lung lobectomy for malignancies were randomized into two groups (25/group). Respiratory function (forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume per 1 s/forced vital capacity, maximum midexpiratory flow rate, peak expiratory flow rate) were evaluated preoperatively, within 4 h after the operation and on the first postoperative day. Visual analog scale (VAS: 0-10) scores were evaluated four-hourly for 20 h. RESULTS: The VAS scores were significantly lower in the EDA versus IC group at the 4th, 8th, and 12th h of observation (mean +/- SD) 5.5 +/- 2.9 vs. 7.3 +/- 2.2 P = 0.04; 4.1 +/- 2.1 vs. 5.1 +/- 2.9 P = 0.02; 3.6 +/- 1.9 vs. 5.2 +/- 2.4 P = 0.01, respectively. Respiratory function parameters deteriorated significantly in both groups (P < 0.001) with no significant difference between the groups. Only one major adverse effect was detected: one patient suffered from rib osteomyelitis after intercostal cannulation and healed following surgical repair.

Continuous infusion of local anesthetic into the incision may help reduce the amount of narcotics required to control postoperative pain. To address this issue, we performed a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial of infusion of bupivacaine versus placebo through intercostal and subcutaneous catheters after thoracotomy. Methods: From April 2006 to June 2007, 124 patients had intercostal catheters placed at thoracotomy and connected to continuous infusion pain pumps. Each patient had catheters placed in the intercostal space near the head of the rib and subcutaneously beneath the incision; both were connected to an infusion pump through a Y connector. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (normal saline solution) or 0.25% bupivacaine as a 4 cc per hour infusion for 100 hours after thoracotomy. All personnel caring for the patients were blinded to the content of the infusion. Demographic information, visual analog pain scores, and oral morphine equivalent usage was recorded for each patient. In addition to the infusion catheters, all patients had epidural analgesia that remained in place until postoperative day 3. Results: There were 60 patients in the bupivacaine arm and 64 in the placebo group. Overall mean age was 64.7 years and 65 (52.4%) were men. Mean body mass index was 28.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. There were no statistical differences in any demographic parameter except that there were more men in the placebo group. Pulmonary resection was performed in 100 patients, an antireflux procedure in 16, and other miscellaneous procedures in 8. There was no statistical difference in the morphine equivalent usage between the two groups. There was also no difference between the average daily pain scores between the two groups. Length of stay was not significantly different between groups: mean (SD) of 6.2 (3.4) and 6.7 (5.0) for placebo and bupivacaine, respectively (p = 0.51). There was no operative mortality, and complications occurred in 28% of patients (placebo group, 25%; bupivacaine group, 32%; p = 0.41). Conclusions: This randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial demonstrated that the infusion of local anesthetic into the subcutaneous area and around the rib fracture site in addition to epidural analgesia did not reduce the amount of narcotic usage after a thoracotomy, nor did it affect visual analog pain scores. Pain control with intercostal catheters infusing local anesthetics did not produce a measurable pain relief beyond that provided by epidural analgesia. 2009 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",English,0

Another 25 patients (group II) had metamizol given intravenously. Respiratory function tests, arterial blood gases, range of shoulder motion, and postoperative pain were evaluated for each group. Bupivacaine and metamizol were given just before finishing the thoracotomy and then repeated every 4 hours for 3 days. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in arterial blood gases between the groups (P >.05). There were statistically significant differences in the respiratory function tests, range of shoulder motion, and visual analogue scale (P <.05) between the groups.

We hypothesized that the combination of PVB and ITO provides analgesia comparable with that of TEA. METHODS: After local ethics committee approval, 84 consecutive patients undergoing open thoracic procedures were randomized to the TEA (ropivacaine 0.2%+sufentanil) or the PVB (ropivacaine 0.5%)+ITO (sufentanil+morphine) group. The primary endpoints were pain intensities at rest and during coughing/movement at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after operation assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) score. Data were analysed by multivariate analysis (anova; P<0.05). RESULTS: Patient and surgical characteristics were comparable between the groups. The mean and maximal VAS scores were lower in the TEA (n=43) than in the PVB+ITO group (n=37) at several time points at rest (P<0.026) and during coughing/movement (P<0.021). However, in the PVB+ITO group, the mean VAS scores never exceeded 1.9 and 3.5 at rest and during coughing/movement, respectively; and the maximal differences between the groups (TEA vs PVB+ITO) in the maximal VAS scores were only 1.2 (3.4 vs 4.6) at rest, and 1.3 (4.4 vs 5.7) during coughing/movement. CONCLUSIONS: Although VAS scores were statistically lower in the TEA compared with the PVB+ITO group at some observation points, the differences were small and of questionable clinical relevance. Thus, combined PVB and ITO can be considered a satisfactory alternative to TEA for post-thoracotomy pain relief. ClinicalTrials.gov number. NCT00493909.",eng,0

This prospective, randomized, and double-blinded study was designed to describe a method of ultrasound-guided TAP block and to evaluate the intra- and postoperative analgesic efficacy in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anaesthesia with or without TAP block. METHODS: Forty-two patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to receive standard general anaesthetic either with (Group A, n=21) or without TAP block (Group B, n=21). Ultrasound-guided bilateral TAP block was performed with a high frequent linear ultrasound probe and an in-plane needle guidance technique with 15 ml bupivacaine 5 mg ml(-1) on each side. Intraoperative use of sufentanil and postoperative demand of morphine using a patient-controlled analgesia device were recorded. RESULTS: Ultrasonographic visualization of the relevant anatomy, detection of the shaft and tip of the needle, and the spread of local anaesthetic were possible in all cases where a TAP block was performed. Patients in Group A received significantly less [corrected] intraoperative sufentanil and postoperative morphine compared with those in Group B [mean (SD) 8.6 (3.5) vs 23.0 (4.8) microg, P<0.01, and 10.5 (7.7) vs 22.8 (4.3) mg, P<0.05].

Nausea and vomiting is also a problem. This study was designed to compare two analgesic techniques (i) regional nerve blockade (ii) local anaesthetic infiltration, with respect to quality and duration of analgesia, opioid requirements and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). METHODS: Forty three children, ASA I-II, aged 3-15 yr, were studied and followed for 24 hr postoperatively. Patients were randomised into two groups. Patients in Group A received local infiltration with lidocaine 1% with adrenaline 1:200,000 0.4 ml.kg-1 (n = 21). Patients in Group B (n = 22) received nerve blockade, bupivacaine 0.5%, 0.4 ml.kg-1. No other form of analgesia was used intraoperatively. Quality and duration of analgesia were assessed using pain and sedation scores recorded by a blinded observer at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 min with Recovery Room, and at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480 min on the ward. Pain score > 6 was treated with fentanyl 1 microgram.kg-1 iv (recovery) and morphine 0.2 mg.kg-1 im or mefenamic acid 8 mg.kg-1 po on the ward. Time to first supplemental analgesia was noted. Mean duration of analgesia was 8.6 (1.1-24) hr, Group A and 10.5 (1.3-24) hr, Group B (P > 0.7). 24% per cent of children (Group A) and 27% (Group B) required no supplemental analgesia (P > 0.6). The degree of pain control resulted in a low requirement for opioids, Group A: 24%, Group B: 14% (P:NS). The overall incidence of PONV was 43% (Group A) and 36% (Group B) (P:NS): PONV correlated with opioid use. There were no differences between the groups with regard to pain/sedation scores, quality/duration of analgesia, opioid requirements and incidence of PONV. CONCLUSION: Both techniques provided excellent postoperative analgesia. Lidocaine 1% infiltration (adrenaline 1:200,000) has the added advantage of improving surgical field and haemostasis.

A pudendal nerve block was used in hemorrhoid surgery to reduce voiding complications. METHODS: The effects of a pudendal nerve block in anal surgery were compared with those of spinal anesthesia. In this prospective study, 163 consecutive patients who underwent elective hemorrhoids surgery by a single surgeon were randomized to receive pudendal nerve block (pudendal group) with 0.5 percent bupivacaine (n = 81) with 1:20,000 epinephrine or spinal anesthesia (spinal group) with 0.5 percentbupivacaine (n = 82). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the patient demographics, total amount of fluid administered, time to the onset of anesthesia, or intraoperative pain. All patients had a successful block during surgery. However, puborectalis muscle relaxation was not complete in the pudendal group. The time from the injection of the anesthetics to the first sensation of pain was longer in the pudendal group (9.1 vs. 3.1 hours; P < 0.001). Urinary catheterization was required in only 6 patients in the pudendal group compared with 57 patients in the spinal group (P < 0.001). The degree of pain was significantly lower in the pudendal group (2.7 vs. 5.2, Visual Analog Scale; P < 0.001). The amount of analgesics injected was significantly lower in the pudendal group (16/81 vs. 45/82; P < 0.001).

Possible modes of postoperative analgesia for umbilical hernia repair are rectus sheath block (RSB) and local anaesthetic infiltration of the surgical site (LAI). METHODS: We undertook an observer-blinded, randomized, prospective, observational study to compare the efficacy of ultrasound-guided RSB and LAI in providing postoperative analgesia for umbilical hernia repair. Our primary objective was to compare the use of opioid medication between patients who receive RSB and those who receive LAI. Our secondary objectives were to compare the duration of analgesia based on time to first rescue analgesic, to compare the quality of analgesia based on revised FACES scale, and to determine the incidence of side-effects. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (26 in each group) completed the study. There was a statistically significant difference in the perioperative opioid medication consumption between the LAI group [mean: 0.13 mg kg(-1), confidence interval (0.09-0.17 mg kg(-)(1))] and the RSB group [mean: 0.07 mg kg(-)(1), confidence interval (0.05-0.09 mg kg(-)(1))] (P=0.008). When we compared the postoperative opioid consumption between the LAI group [mean: 0.1 mg kg(-)(1), 95% confidence interval (0.07-0.13 mg kg(-)(1))] and the RSB group [mean: 0.07 mg kg(-1), 95% confidence interval (0.05-0.09 mg kg(-)(1))] (P=0.09), there was a trend towards statistical significance between the two groups. The difference in time to rescue analgesic administration between the RSB group [49.7 (36.9) min] and the LAI group [32.4 (29.4) min] was not statistically significant (P=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ultrasound-guided RSB provides superior analgesia in the perioperative period compared with infiltration of the surgical site after umbilical hernia repair. In comparing only the postoperative period, analgesia provided by an ultrasound-guided RSB showed a trend towards statistically significant improvement compared with infiltration of the surgical site.",eng,1

Thus, we performed this randomized clinical trial comparing ultrasound versus nerve stimulator-guided interscalene blocks for shoulder arthroscopy to determine whether ultrasound could reduce the incidence of postoperative neurological symptoms. METHODS: Two hundred thirty patients were randomized to a standardized interscalene block with either ultrasound or nerve stimulator with a 5 cm, 22 g Stimuplex insulated needle with 1.5% mepivacaine with 1:300,000 epinephrine and NaCO3 (1 meq/10 mL). A standardized neurological assessment tool (questionnaire and physical examination) designed by a neurologist was administered before surgery (both components), at approximately 1 wk after surgery (questionnaire), and at approximately 4-6 weeks after surgery (both components). Diagnosis of postoperative neurological symptoms was determined by a neurologist blinded to block technique. RESULTS: Two hundred nineteen patients were evaluated. Use of ultrasound decreased the number of needle passes for block performance (1 vs 3, median, P < 0.001), enhanced motor block at the 5-min assessment (P = 0.04) but did not decrease block performance time (5 min for both). No patient required conversion to general anesthesia for failed block, and patient satisfaction was similar in both groups (96% nerve stimulator and 92% ultrasound). The incidence of postoperative neurological symptoms was similar at 1 wk follow-up with 11% (95% CI of 5%-17%) for nerve stimulator and 8% (95% CI of 3%-13%) for ultrasound and was similar at late follow-up with 7% (95% CI of 3%-12%) for nerve stimulator and 6% (95% CI of 2%-11%) for ultrasound. The severity of postoperative neurological symptoms was similar between groups with a median patient rating of moderate. Symptoms were primarily sensory and consisted of pain, tingling, or paresthesias. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound reduced the number of needle passes needed to perform interscalene block and enhanced motor block at the 5 min assessment; however, we did not observe significant differences in block failures, patient satisfaction or incidence, and severity of postoperative neurological symptoms.

In the immediate postoperative period, a 51% reduction in demand and a 31% reduction in consumption of morphine delivered by a patient-controlled analgesic system was demonstrated. There was more than fivefold reduction in the incidence of nausea, as well as reduced visual analog and verbal pain scores for patients who received a suprascapular nerve block. The duration of hospital stay was reduced by 24% in the suprascapular nerve block group. A 24-h phone call interview revealed a 40% reduction in analgesic consumption and a reduction in verbal pain scores at rest and on abduction. There were no complications from the suprascapular nerve block. This study demonstrates that a suprascapular nerve block for pain relief in arthroscopic shoulder surgery is an effective and safe modality of postoperative pain relief.",eng,0

Carr,2007.0,Continuous lumbar plexus block provides improved analgesia with fewer side effects compared with systemic opioids after hip arthroplasty: a randomized controlled trial,10.1016/j.rapm.2007.04.008,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A single injection lumbar plexus block for acute pain management after hip surgery is usually limited to the immediate postoperative period. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of a continuous lumbar plexus block on perioperative opioid requirements and pain intensity. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing elective hip arthroplasty under general anesthesia were randomized to continuous lumbar plexus block combined with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or PCA only for postoperative pain. Patients allocated to the lumbar plexus block had the catheter placed before surgery. Patients were followed for 36 hours. Perioperative opioid requirement was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included assessment of pain intensity, patient and surgeon satisfaction with the analgesic technique, and occurrence of nausea and vomiting. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were randomized to each treatment group. Compared with patients in the PCA group, patients in the continuous lumbar plexus block group required less morphine (12 mg) (95% CI, -12.9 to -3.9), had on average less pain (-2.1 units on a 0 to 10 scale) (95% CI, -3.8 to -1.1), were more satisfied with their analgesic technique, and experienced less nausea and vomiting. One patient in the continuous lumbar plexus block developed a delayed paresis and 1 patient in the PCA group developed respiratory depression. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous lumbar plexus block combined with PCA is superior to PCA alone for postoperative pain management following hip replacement. It reduces opioid requirements, opioid related side effects, and enhances patient satisfaction. However, additional research is required to determine its safety in light of the neurologic injury observed.",eng,1

The efficacy of infraorbital nerve block in reducing isoflurane consumption and postoperative pain was evaluated in patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal maxillary sinus surgery (ESS) under general anesthesia. Methods. Fifty patients were randomly allocated to either the block group (n = 15) or the nonblock group (n = 25). After the establishment of general anesthesia with isoflurane, nitrous oxide, and oxygen, the patients received infraorbital nerve block with 1.0ml of either 0.5% bupivacaine (block group) or normal saline (nonblock group) administered into the soft tissue in front of the infraorbital foramen. Systolic blood pressure during anesthesia and surgery was maintained at 85-90 mmHg by adjusting the inspiratory concentration of isoflurane, and its consumption was evaluated in both groups. Pain intensity at 15 min after the end of anesthesia was also evaluated on a five-point pain scale. Results. The consumption of isoflurane under a fresh gas flow of 61min<sup>-1</sup> was 17.3 + 6.5 mlkg<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup> (mean + SD) in the block group and 27.4 + 9.4 mlkg<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup> in the nonblock group during surgery (P < 0.001). Nicardipine was required during surgery less frequently in the block group than in the nonblock group (P < 0.01). Postoperative pain intensity was lower in the block group than in the nonblock group (P < 0.01). Conclusion. General anesthesia combined with infraorbital nerve block is effective in reducing the consumption of isoflurane and postoperative pain intensity in ESS.",English,1

We questioned whether there might also be a place for their use in conjunction with regional anesthesia and whether there was a preferable route for NSAID administration. METHODS: Ilioinguinal and field blocks were performed preoperatively on seventy patients undergoing outpatient inguinal hernia repair. Patients were divided into a control group who received no ketorolac and four study groups who received a preoperative dose of 30 mg ketorolac by one of the following routes: i.v., i.m., p.o., or intrawound (i.w.). The ketorolac in the i.w group was mixed in the syringe with the local anesthetic used for the field block. i.v. and i.m. groups also received ketorolac at the time of the preoperative regional anesthesia and the PO group received the dose at least one hour preoperatively. All patients received a similar general anesthetic intraoperatively. RESULTS: Postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements were lowest for the i.m., i.v., and i.w. groups. Pain scores and analgesic requirements for the PO group were less than for the control group but more than for the other three groups. Analgesic efficacy therefore ranked: i.m. = i.v. = i.w. > p.o. > control. Though no differences were found between groups in the time to discharge from the recovery room, the ease of nursing care paralleled the findings for pain scores and analgesia requirements. CONCLUSION: Beyond the analgesia provided by the regional anesthesia of the ilioinguinal and field blocks, the preoperative use of ketorolac further reduced postoperative pain scores and the need for additional postoperative analgesic medication. Comparable outcomes for the i.v., i.m. and i.w. groups indicate the lack of any benefit to concentrating the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug at the wound (i.w.) or to achieving high blood levels rapidly (i.v.). In conclusion, ketorolac is a useful supplement to ilioinguinal plus field block regional anesthesia for hernia surgery and is most effective administered parenterally.",eng,0

Recent randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in providing postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgery. We hypothesized that a TAP block may reduce pain while coughing and at rest for the first 24 postoperative hours, opioid consumption, and opioid side effects in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in day-case surgery. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind study, 80 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in our day-case surgery unit were allocated to receive either bilateral ultrasound-guided posterior TAP blocks (20 mL 0.5% ropivacaine) or placebo blocks. Postoperative pain treatment consisted of oral acetaminophen 1000 mg x 4, oral ibuprofen 400 mg x 3, IV morphine (0-2 hours postoperatively), and oral ketobemidone (2-24 hours postoperatively). The primary outcome was postoperative pain scores while coughing calculated as area under the curve for the first 24 postoperative hours (AUC/24 h). Secondary outcomes were pain scores at rest (AUC/24 h), opioid consumption, and side effects. Patients were assessed 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours postoperatively. Group-wise comparisons of visual analog scale (VAS) pain (AUC/24 h) were performed with the 2-sample t test. Morphine and ketobemidone consumption were compared with the Mann-Whitney test for unpaired data. Categorical data were analyzed using the chi(2) test. RESULTS: The primary outcome variable, VAS pain scores while coughing (AUC/24 h), was significantly reduced in the TAP versus the placebo group (P = 0.04); group TAP: 26 mm (SD 13) (weighted average level) versus group placebo: 34 (18) (95% confidence interval): 0.5-15 mm). VAS pain scores at rest (AUC/24 h) showed no significant difference between groups. Median morphine consumption (0-2 hours postoperatively) was 7.5 mg (interquartile range: 5-10 mg) in the placebo group compared with 5 mg (interquartile range: 0-5 mg) in the TAP group (P < 0.001). The odds ratio of a random patient in group TAP having less morphine consumption than a random patient in group placebo was P (group TAP < group placebo) = 0.26 (confidence interval: 0.15, 0.37) where 0.5 represents no difference between groups. There were no between-group differences in total ketobemidone consumption, levels of nausea and sedation, number of patients vomiting, or consumption of ondansetron. CONCLUSIONS: TAP block after laparoscopic cholecystectomy may have some beneficial effect in reducing pain while coughing and on opioid requirements, but this effect is probably rather small.",eng,1

Nikolis,2011.0,General anaesthesia versus thoracic paravertebral block for breast surgery: a meta-analysis,10.1016/j.bjps.2011.03.025,"BACKGROUND: Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) offers an attractive alternative to general anaesthesia (GA) for ambulatory breast surgery. The aim of this meta-analysis was first to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TPVB for breast surgery, and second to compare TPVB with GA with regard to postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, opioid consumption and length of hospital stay. METHODS: An electronic and manual search of English- and French-language articles on TPVB in breast surgery (published from January 1980 to June 2010) yielded 41 citations. Two levels of screening identified 11 relevant studies. The Mantel-Haenszel method (fixed effect) was used to perform the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies were retained for analysis. When TPVB was used instead of GA, pain scores were significantly decreased at 1 and 6 h postoperatively (mean difference of 2.48 (95%confidence interval (CI): 2.20-2.75) and 1.71 (95%CI: 1.64-1.78), respectively). Furthermore, postoperative analgesic consumption was significantly lower in patients who received TPVB compared with GA (relative risk (RR) 0.23, (95%CI: 0.15-0.37)). TPVB was also associated with significantly less postoperative nausea and vomiting (RR 0.27 (95%CI: 0.12-0.61)). Increased patient satisfaction and a shorter hospital stay also favoured TPVB over GA. CONCLUSIONS: TPVB provides effective anaesthesia for ambulatory breast surgery and can result in significant benefits over GA. However, further studies are required to determine whether these advantages would still be present if an optimal technique for outpatient GA is employed. Adjunctive ultrasonography may contribute to improve the safety of TPVB in breast surgery and requires further investigation.",eng,0
Journal Article,S. R. Schell,2006.0,Patient outcomes after axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer: use of postoperative continuous local anesthesia infusion,10.1016/j.jss.2005.11.571,"BACKGROUND: Although considered a safe surgical procedure, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is associated with postoperative numbness, paresthesias, pain, and muscle weakness. Despite meticulous surgical technique and the absence of long thoracic or thoracodorsal nerve injury, the risk of these complications are reported as great as 35% to 50%, with a subset of patients developing chronic pain syndromes. METHODS: Female patients (n = 27) undergoing Level I-II ALND for breast cancer were recruited. After ALND, patients were randomized to three groups. Group 1 received standard axillary lymph node dissection. Patients assigned to group 2 or 3 (double-blinded) received 120 h continuous 0.9% saline solution or 0.5% bupivacaine using a catheter placed into the axilla and delivered by an elastomeric pump device. After routine postoperative care, patients were discharged with oral opioid analgesics. Twice-daily assessment of pain, sedation, and nausea were conducted using validated visual-analog scale measures. Daily and total opioid analgesic requirements after surgery were recorded. RESULTS: Patients treated with a continuous infusion of bupivacaine experienced significantly lower pain scores (P < 0.001) during the first 5 postoperative days. Postoperative opioid analgesic requirements also were significantly decreased in the bupivacaine group, and these effects persisted until postoperative day 14 (P < 0.001). Concomitant to the observed decreases in pain and oral opioid requirements, nausea and morning sedation also were significantly reduced. There were no pump-related complications, wound infections, or postoperative axillary fluid collections. CONCLUSIONS: The use of continuous administration of bupivicaine after ALND significantly decreases pain and opioid analgesic requirements, with concomitant decreases in nausea and sedation. This study provides encouraging evidence of the therapeutic benefits of continuous infusion of local anesthesia and may represent a valuable adjunct for surgical patients who require ALND, including those with breast cancer and melanoma.",eng,0

To determine the impact of pre-operative and intra-operative ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block on post-operative analgesic utilization and length of stay (LOS). Methods. We conducted a prospective randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial to assess effectiveness of ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block (IINB) on post-operative morphine consumption in female study patients (n = 60). Patients undergoing laparotomy via Pfannenstiel incision received injection of either 0.5% bupivacaine + 5 mcg/ml epinephrine for IINB (Group I, n = 28) or saline of equivalent volume given to the same site (Group II, n = 32). All injections were placed before the skin incision and after closure of rectus fascia via direct infiltration. Measured outcomes were post-operative morphine consumption (and associated side-effects), visual analogue pain scores, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Results. No difference in morphine use was observed between the two groups (47.3 mg in Group I vs. 45.9 mg in Group II; p = 0.85). There was a trend toward lower pain scores after surgery in Group I, but this was not statistically significant. The mean time to initiate oral narcotics was also similar, 23.3 h in Group I and 22.8 h in Group II (p = 0.7). LOS was somewhat shorter in Group I compared to Group II, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.8). Side-effects occurred with similar frequency in both study groups. Conclusion. In this population of patients undergoing inpatient surgery of the female reproductive tract, utilization of post-operative narcotics was not significantly influenced by IINB. Pain scores and LOS were also apparently unaffected by IINB, indicating a need for additional properly controlled prospective studies to identify alternative methods to optimize post-surgical pain management and reduce LOS. 2008 Wehbe et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",English,1

The rectus sheath block may offer improved pain management following umbilical hernia repair. In this pilot study, we compared the efficacy of the rectus sheath block with that of our current standard practice--local anesthetic infiltration into the surgical wound--for pain control after umbilical hernia repair in children. METHODS: Fourteen children, aged 1-8 years, undergoing umbilical hernia repair were randomly assigned to receive either a rectus sheath block or local anesthetic infiltration into the surgical wound at completion of surgery. Anesthetic management was standardized. Each analgesic technique was performed using 0.8 ml x kg(-1) of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000. Postoperatively, an investigator who was blinded to the analgesic technique recorded the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) scores and sedation scores every 10 min, and administered intravenous morphine 50 microg x kg(-1) for cases with CHEOPS scores > or = 8. Total morphine dose was recorded. Parents were telephoned the day after surgery to determine the overall satisfaction with pain control. RESULTS: Total postoperative morphine consumption did not differ significantly between groups, averaging 0.10 +/- 0.09 and 0.10 +/- 0.07 mg x kg(-1) for the local infiltration and rectus sheath groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in pain or sedation scores, and no complications related to either analgesic technique. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that the rectus sheath block has no advantage over infiltration of local anesthetic into the surgical wound for postoperative pain management in children undergoing umbilical hernia repair.",eng,1

METHODS: Sixty patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to one of two groups with 30 patients each: bilateral nerve stimulator guided paravertebral blockade at the T5 to T6 level either prior to induction of general anesthesia (Group 1) or blockade immediately postoperatively (Group 2). RESULTS: The preoperative paravertebral block group had significantly lower visual analog scale scores compared with the postoperative paravertebral block group both at rest 12 hours postoperatively (1.06 vs. 1.89; P < 0.05), on movement 12 hours postoperatively (1.89 vs. 3.00; P < 0.001) and on coughing 12 hours postoperatively (2.24 vs. 3.17; P < 0.01). The consumption of analgesics as well as the duration of hospital stay was significantly reduced in patients receiving preoperative paravertebral blocks (P < 0.05).

Journal Article,A. Fassoulaki,1982.0,Brachial plexus block for pain relief after modified radical mastectomy,", ","Brachial plexus block using an intraclavicular approach was performed at the completion of surgery in 47 patients having modified radical mastectomies. In 48 control patients having similar operations, brachial plexus block was not performed. Of the 47 patients in whom brachial plexus block was performed, 26 (55%) required analgesia during the first 24 hours after the operation, whereas 44 (91%) of the 48 control patients required analgesics (p less than 0.0005). The time elapsed between the end of anesthesia and requirement of the first analgesic was significantly longer when the brachial plexus was blocked (p less than 0.001). The efficacy, simplicity, and safety of blocking the brachial plexus at the completion of surgery following modified mastectomy demonstrate that this technique could be routinely used for the relief of postoperative pain in patients having modified radical mastectomies.",eng,1

The goal of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of the ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block (US-TAP block) in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery via a transverse lower abdominal skin incision. METHODS: Thirty-two patients undergoing gynecologic surgery were randomized to undergo standard care such as PCA, or to receive additional US-TAP block with standard care. After general anesthesia induction, a bilateral US-TAP block was performed using 0.375% ropivacaine 20 ml on each side. Postoperative demand of rescue analgesics in PACU and ward were recorded. Each patient was assessed postoperatively by a blinded investigator in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 2, 6, 10, 24, 48 hr postoperatively to investigate pain, drowsiness, nausea and itch. RESULTS: The US-TAP block reduced pain intensity compared to standard care in the PACU (5.2 +/- 3.1 vs 8.4 +/- 1.3) and at 2, 24 postoperative hours (3.0 +/- 2.4 vs 5.2 +/- 2.4, 0.9 +/- 1.5 vs 2.2 +/- 1.9). Fentanyl requirements in PACU was reduced (20.3 +/- 20.9 vs 62.5 +/- 35.4 microg, P < 0.05). In ward, pethidine requirements was reduced (21.9 +/- 28.7 vs 56.3 +/- 34.8 mg, P < 0.05).

Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and paravertebral block (PVB) are established analgesic golden standards for open surgery such as thoracotomy; however, there is no gold standard for regional analgesia for VATS. This systematic review aimed to assess different regional techniques with regard to effect on acute postoperative pain following VATS, with emphasis on VATS lobectomy. The systematic review of PubMed, The Cochrane Library and Embase databases yielded 1542 unique abstracts; 17 articles were included for qualitative assessment, of which three were studies on VATS lobectomy. The analgesic techniques included TEA, multilevel and single PVB, paravertebral catheter, intercostal catheter, interpleural infusion and long thoracic nerve block. Overall, the studies were heterogeneous with small numbers of participants. In comparative studies, TEA and especially PVB showed some effect on pain scores, but were often compared with an inferior analgesic treatment. Other techniques showed no unequivocal results. No clear gold standard for regional analgesia for VATS could be demonstrated, but a guide of factors to include in future studies on regional analgesia for VATS is presented. The Author 2013.

This study aimed to determine the effect of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block on morphine requirements 24 h after abdominal surgery. Secondary outcomes included the effect of TAP block on morphine use 48 h after surgery, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and impact on reported pain scores (visual analogue scale). METHOD: A systematic review of the literature was conducted for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of TAP block in adults undergoing abdominal surgery. For continuous data, weighted mean differences (WMD) were formulated; for dichotomous data, odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Results were produced with a random effects model with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Nine studies, including published and unpublished data, containing a total of 413 patients were included. Of these 205 received a TAP block and 208 a placebo. Cumulative morphine utilization was statistically significantly reduced at 24 h. [WMD=23.71mg (38.66-8.76); P=0.002] and 48h [WMD=38.08mg (18.97-57.19); P<0.0001] in patients who received a TAP block and the incidence of PONV was significantly reduced [OR=0.41(0.22-0.74); P=0.003]. There was a nonsignificant reduction in the visual analogue scales of postoperative pain [WMD=0.73cm (1.84-0.38), P=0.2]. There were no reported adverse events following TAP block. CONCLUSION: Transversus abdominis plane block is safe, reduces postoperative morphine requirements, nausea and vomiting and possibly the severity of pain after abdominal surgery. It should be considered as part of a multimodal approach to anaesthesia and enhanced recovery in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.",eng,1

Critical review of the literature about the possibilities of management of postoperative pain after spinal operations. METHODS: A total of 113 patients were randomly given 5 mg morphine sulfate (N=42), 10 ml 0,25% ropivacaine (N=42) or physiological NaCl solution (N=21) locally after lumbar disc operation before wound closure. Postoperative lumbar and radicular pain was scored by the patients from 0 to 10 and registered on the evening of the day of operation and on the 1., 2., 3., and 5. days. Mean pain numbers of the 3 groups have been compared, subdivided into local lumbar and in radicular pain. Our own results have been compared with the results of reports in the literature. RESULTS: In our own study the morphine group had less lumbar and less radicular pain on all 5 days than both of the two other groups. This difference was statistically significant on days 0, 1, 2, and 3. The ropivacaine group was on all days less effective than the morphine group, better than the placebo group on the operation and first day, but the difference against the placebo group was statistically not significant. CONCLUSION: Local application of 5 mg morphine sulfate is effective in prevention or reduction of postoperative lumbar and radicular pain after lumbar disc operations. Ropivacain is less effective. The routine application of epidural morphine at the end of spinal operations can be recommended. It also can be justified to try to prolong the morphine effect by mixing it into a paste as described by Needham and by Hurlbert, and to irrigate the operative field with ropivacaine at the end of the operation.",eng,0

DESIGN: Controlled, prospective, randomized, pilot study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: 60 patients undergoing shoulder surgery. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN MEASUREMENTS: The brachial plexus was identified using a stimulating needle. In conventional catheter group 1 (CC 1), local anesthetic (LA) was injected through the needle and catheters were advanced blindly thereafter. In catheter group 2 (CC 2), catheters were blindly inserted and LA was injected through the catheter. In the stimulating catheter group (SC), LA was injected only after catheter tip location was confirmed by nerve stimulation. Time required to perform the block, pain intensity at rest, and dynamic pain (defined movement: lifting of arm; numeric rating scale, 0-10), patient satisfaction (verbal rating scale, Likert scale), and plasma concentrations of ropivacaine were measured. MAIN RESULTS: Patients in the SC group had significantly decreased pain scores. The median block performance time was 6 minutes in CC 1 (CI 25%-75%: 4-8 min), 11 minutes in CC 2 (CI 25%-75%: 7-13 min), and 12 minutes in SC (CI 25%-75%: 10-24 min).

However, TAP block combined with multimodal analgesia technique have not been assessed in a randomized controlled trial. This randomized, controlled, observer-blinded study was designed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of bilateral ultrasound-guided TAP blocks with or without acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) combination. METHODS: Patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy were randomized to one of three groups. Group 1 (n = 25) received a TAP block and ketorolac 30 mg, IV at the end of surgery and then ketorolac plus paracetamol 650 mg, orally, every 6 h for 24 h. Group 2 (n = 24) received only TAP block at the end of surgery. Group 3 (n = 25) received ketorolac 30 mg, IV at the end of surgery and then ketorolac plus paracetamol 650 mg, orally, every 6 h for 24 h. All patients received IV-PCA morphine for 24-h, postoperatively. All patients received a standardized general anaesthetic technique and dexamethasone 4 mg and ondansetron 4 mg, IV for antiemetic prophylaxis. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in pain at rest between the groups. However, the pain on coughing (dynamic pain) in Group 1 was significantly less variable, compared with the other two groups (P = 0.012). Opioid consumption and occurrences of nausea, vomiting, and rescue antiemetic were similar in three the groups.

Embase, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) bibliographic databases were searched using a Cochrane Library search strategy modified for gynecological surgery. We included randomized controlled trials comparing transversus abdominis plane block with no block or placebo block. We retrieved 681 citations from which we included five published studies (225 randomized participants) which fulfilled our inclusion criteria, and identified a further six ongoing studies. Quality was assessed across six risk of bias domains: randomization sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, missing outcome data, selective reporting and other biases. Data were meta-analyzed where possible and presented as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Study quality was moderate. Compared with no block or saline placebo, transversus abdominis plane block provided significantly less postoperative pain at rest on a 10 cm visual analog scale at 2h (mean difference -2.14 cm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.57 to -0.71) but not at 24h postoperatively (-0.52 cm, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.45). Pain on movement showed similar results. Transversus abdominis plane block resulted in significantly less postoperative requirement for morphine use at 24h (-11.76 mg, 95% CI -18.77 to -4.75) but not at 48 h (-16.01 mg, 95% CI -39.40 to 7.39). Evidence exists for the short-term efficacy (within 24 h) of transversus abdominis plane blocks during hysterectomy in terms of reported pain and morphine consumption, which may not be sustained at 48 h. Updates to this review should be undertaken periodically, and until further robust evidence is available, anesthetists should not rush to adopt this procedure into routine practice.",eng,1

We compare three different postoperative analgesic approaches based on TPVB: anesthetist, anesthetist plus surgeon, and surgeon. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We randomized 54 patients undergoing elective thoracotomy to three different postoperative analgesia groups: paravertebral percutaneous catheter (PVA group), paravertebral percutaneous catheter plus incisional (subcutaneous) catheter (PVA+Inc), and paravertebral catheter under direct vision (PVS group). During early postoperative 48h, we measured pain intensity, intravenous morphine afforded by the patient-controlled analgesia pump, and the spirometric test. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences among the collected preoperative data. No significant differences were observed on postoperative spirometric values. Analgesic quality was better in PVA+Inc group at 12 and 24 postoperative hours. In this group, intravenous morphine use to improve analgesia was significantly lower from 8h until 48h postoperative. CONCLUSIONS: Association of thoracic paravertebral block to continuous infusion of a local anesthetic in the surgical incision area affords a better pain relief than paravertebral block alone (introduced by the surgeon or the anesthetist).",eng,0

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial. SETTING: A teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients at a tertiary care teaching hospital undergoing throracotomy for lung cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were assigned randomly to receive a continuous thoracic epidural or paravertebral infusion. Patients in the epidural group were randomized to receive either bupivacaine alone or in combination with hydromorphone. Visual analog scores as well as incentive spirometery results were obtained before and after thoracotomy. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-five consecutive patients presenting for thoracotomy were enrolled in this institutional review board-approved study. On the morning of surgery, subjects were randomized to either an epidural group receiving bupvicaine with and without hydromorphone or a paravertebral catheter-infused bupvicaine. Postoperative visual analog scores and incentive spirometry data were measured in the postanesthesia care unit, the evening of the first operative day, and daily thereafter until postoperative day 4. Analgesia on all postoperative days was superior in the thoracic epidural group receiving bupivacaine plus hydromorphone. Analgesia was similar in the epidural and continuous paravertebral groups receiving bupivacaine alone. No significant improvement was noted by combining the continuous infusion of bupivacaine via the paravertebral and epidural routes. Incentive spirometry goals were best achieved in the epidural bupivacaine and hydromorphone group and equal in the group receiving bupivacaine alone either via epidural or continuous paravertebral infusion. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provided data that fill gaps in the current literature in 3 important areas. First, this study found that thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) with bupivacaine and a hydrophilic opioid, hydromorphone, may provide enhanced analgesia over TEA or continuous paravertebral infusion (CPI) with bupivacaine alone. Second, in the bupivacaine-alone group, the increased basal rates required to achieve analgesia resulted in hypotension more frequently than in the bupivacaine/hydromorphone combination group, underscoring the benefit of the synergistic activity. Finally, in agreement with previous retrospective studies, the current data suggest that CPI of local anesthetic appears to provide acceptable analgesia for post-thoracotomy pain.",eng,1

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of subtenon block for providing perioperative analgesia in infants undergoing cataract surgeries. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial, 63 infants of ASA grade I and II (1-12 months) were recruited to receive either subtenon block (Group SB) or 1 mug.kg(-1) i.v. fentanyl (Group F) after induction of anesthesia. Primary outcome was the number of infants requiring rescue analgesia during 4-h study period before discharge of the infants. Secondary outcomes assessed were CRIES pain score, incidence of oculocardiac reflex, surgical difficulty, and incidence of postoperative emesis. RESULTS: The number of infants requiring rescue analgesia during 4-h study period was significantly less in Group SB (n = 6/32, 18.8%) compared to Group F (n = 14/31, 45.2%, P = 0.032). CRIES scores were significantly lower at and after 40 min compared to immediate postoperative period in Group F while these were comparable at all time intervals in Group SB. CRIES scores were significantly lower in Group SB compared to Group F at all time intervals except at 1 h. The incidence of oculocardiac reflex and the postoperative emesis were comparable in both the groups.

Despite significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of pain, the development of therapeutic options, and the publication and dissemination of guidelines, this progress does not seem to have been adopted into clinical practice. Bonica has stated 'for many years I have studied the reasons for inadequate management of postoperative pain, and they remain the same. . . . Inadequate or improper application of available information and therapies is certainly the most important reason' [71]. Let us accept the challenge to re-evaluate pain management in the postoperative neurosurgical patient. Future development may provide enhanced multimodal analgesia with the development of enantioselective NSAIDs and peripherally acting opioids that do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Targeted inhibition of the central neuroplasticity that underlies sensitization, rather than attempts to use pre-emptive analgesics, may be more fruitful. Inhibition of excitatory amino acids may prove beneficial for perioperative neuroprotection and pain management. In addition, longer-acting local anesthetics show significant promise. The importance of understanding the specific benefits available and matching these characteristics to the particular patient is emphasized. Evaluation of outcomes, including morbidity and patient satisfaction, will determine if effective and rational provision of analgesia may indeed be safer than withholding analgesia. However, it is clear that re-evaluation and refinement of conventional therapy is necessary.",English,0

Because sensory afferents from the hip include several branches of the lumbar plexus, the authors hypothesized that a lumbar plexus block could reduce pain from a major hip procedure. Methods: In a double-blind prospective trial, 60 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty were randomized to receive general anesthesia with (plexus group, n = 30) or without (control group, n = 30) a posterior lumbar plexus block. The block was performed after induction using a nerve stimulator, and 0.4 ml/kg bupivacaine, 0.5%, with epinephrine was injected. General anesthesia was standardized, and supplemental fentanyl was administered per hemodynamic guidelines. Postoperative pain and patient- controlled intravenous morphine use were serially assessed for 48 h. Results: The proportion of patients receiving supplemental fentanyl intraoperatively was more than 3 times greater in the control group (20 of 30 vs. 6 of 29, P = 0.001). In the postanesthesia care unit, a greater than fourfold reduction in pain scores was observed in the plexus group (visual analogue scale [VAS] pain score at arrival 1.3 + 2 vs. 5.6 + 3, P < 0.001), and 'rescue' morphine boluses (administered if VAS > 3) were administered 10 times less frequently (in 2 of 28 vs. in 22 of 29 patients, P < 0.0001). Pain scores and morphine consumption remained significantly lower in the plexus group until 6 h after randomization (VAS at 6 h, 1.4 + 1.3 vs. 2.4 + 1.4, P = 0.007; cumulative morphine at 6 h, 5.6 + 4.7 vs. 12.6 + 7.5 mg, P < 0.0001). Operative and postoperative (48 h) blood loss was modestly decreased in the treated group. Epidural-like distribution of anesthesia occurred in 3 of 28 plexus group patients, but no other side-effects were noted. Conclusions: Posterior lumbar plexus block provides effective analgesia for total hip arthroplasty, reducing intra- and postoperative opioid requirements. Moreover, blood loss during and after the procedure is diminished. Epidural anesthetic distribution should be anticipated in a minority of cases.",English,1

METHODS: The study population consisted of 100 ASA 1 and 2 boys aged 3 to 8 years who were undergoing circumcision for religious reasons. In all participants, inhalation anesthesia was administered with oxygen : nitrous oxide (1 : 2) and halothane. The participants were allocated randomly into two groups of 50 children each. Group 1 received penile block and Group 2 caudal block. The penile block was achieved by injecting bupivacaine into the two compartments of the subpubic space, with an additional ventral infiltration of a small volume of bupivacaine along the raphe of the penis. For caudal block, 1 ml.kg(-1) body weight of 0.25% bupivacaine was administered. RESULTS: Penile block shortened the induction-incision time and enabled earlier discharge home compared with caudal block. One patient undergoing penile block and nine patients undergoing caudal block vomited. CONCLUSIONS: Penile and caudal block are equally effective for postcircumcision analgesia and neither is associated with serious complications. Anesthesiologist preference should be the deciding factor in choosing one technique over the other.",eng,1

Secondary endpoints included analgesic consumption, parental satisfaction, and postoperative complications. Settings and Design: Prospective, crossover randomized controlled trial performed on children undergoing unilateral groin surgery. Methods: Fifty children aged 1-6 years scheduled for unilateral groin surgery were included in the study. After induction of general anesthesia and prior to surgical incision, patients were prospectively randomized into one of two groups: Group B received US-guided II/IH nerve blocks with 0.1 ml.kg <sup>-1</sup> of 0.25% bupivacaine and Group C received a caudal blockade with 0.7 ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> of 0.25% bupivacaine.

Statistical Analysis: Arithmetic mean and standard deviation values were calculated and statistical analyses were performed for each group. Independent sample t-test was used to compare continuous variables exhibiting normal distribution, and Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test for non-continuous variables. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: The average pain scores during hospital stay were 1.82+1.71and 1.52+1.41 for group C and group B respectively (P>0.05). The average time to first rescue analgesia was longer in group B 253+102.6 min as compared to 219.6+48.4 min in group C. In recovery room, four patients in group C required pain rescue medication compared to five patients in group B (P>0.05). Similarly eight patients in the group C and six patients in group B required pain rescue medication at day-stay unit or at home (P>0.05). Group C received 0.74 pain rescue medication doses (range 0-8), while group B received 0.65 pain rescue medication doses (range 0-6) at hospital and at home (P>0.05). Conclusions: US-guided II/IH nerve blocks is an ideal postoperative analgesic for unilateral groin surgery in children, particularly hernia repairs and is as effective as caudal block, with a lower volume of local anesthetics.",English,1

Schifrine,2003.0,Intrathecal morphine provides better postoperative analgesia than psoas compartment block after primary hip arthroplasty,10.1007/bf03018643,"PURPOSE: Intrathecal morphine and psoas compartment block represent two accepted techniques to provide postoperative analgesia after hip arthroplasty. We designed a prospective, randomized, single-blinded study to compare these two techniques. METHODS: Patients scheduled for primary hip arthroplasty under general anesthesia were randomized to receive either an intrathecal administration of 0.1 mg morphine (Group I, n = 27) or a psoas compartment block with ropivacaine 0.475% 25 mL (Group II, n = 26). Pain scores, morphine consumption, associated side-effects were assessed for 48 hr postoperatively. In addition, patient's acceptance and satisfaction of the postoperative analgesic technique were also recorded. RESULTS: During the first 24 hr, pain scores (3.3 +/- 9.6 mm vs 22.8 +/- 27.1 at H+6, 3.3 +/- 8.3 mm vs 25 +/- 26.7 mm at H+12, 7 +/- 14.9 mm vs 21.9 +/- 29 mm at H+18) and morphine consumption (0.56 +/- 2.12 mg vs 9.42 +/- 10.13 mg) were lower in Group I than in Group II. Urinary retention was the more frequent side-effect occurring in 37% of cases in Group I vs 11.5% in Group II (P < 0.05). No major complication occurred. Despite better analgesia provided by the use of intrathecal morphine, there was no difference in the satisfaction scores between groups. CONCLUSION: 0.1 mg intrathecal morphine administration provides better postoperative analgesia than single-shot psoas compartment block after primary hip arthroplasty.",eng,1

Despite these advantages, many patients complain about shoulder pain (SP) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The purpose of this review was to evaluate intraperitoneal instillation (IPI) of saline and local anesthesia (LA) to minimize SP. METHODS: A search of the literature was conducted using PubMed and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE). Eligibility criteria were: randomized clinical trials (RCT) evaluating IPI of saline and/or LA to minimize incidence or severity of SP after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Only papers published in English were included. Data extracted were year of publication, number of participants and allocation, timing of IPI, and nonsignificant or significant effect on incidence or severity of SP. RESULTS: A total of 24 RCTs were included in the review. Four RCTs reported results on IPI saline as intervention versus nothing as control. Seven RCTs reported results on IPI LA as intervention versus nothing as control. Sixteen RCTs reported results on IPI LA as intervention versus saline as control. IPI saline resulted in a significant reduction in SP severity compared with nothing. IPI LA was associated with an overall significant reduction of SP severity compared with nothing. Results regarding the effect IPI LA versus saline showed contradictory results in regards to both SP incidence and severity. CONCLUSIONS: Both IPI of saline and LA can be used to reduce SP severity after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It is not possible to conclude whether the incidence of SP can be reduced with saline or LA, due to contradictive results.",eng,0

For the study, 81 patients were randomized to receive a brachial plexus blockade using the IS or ISCM approach followed by general anesthesia for their surgical procedure. Intraoperative analgesics were controlled for in both groups. No differences in demographics, block success rate, pain scale scores, and analgesia duration were noted between groups. The ISCM group required less time to complete the block (7.08 +/- 2.9 min) compared with the IS group (9.62 +/- 5.31 min) (P = .039), achieved a significantly higher rate of complete motor and sensory block at 30 minutes (P = .032), and had fewer side effects (P = .049). Based on our results, we found that using the ISCM approach to the brachial plexus resulted in a faster onset of anesthesia and a higher ratio of complete block at 30 minutes compared with the IS approach.",eng,0

METHODS: Thirty patients ASA physical status II-III undergoing scheduled palliative or corrective cardiac surgery, receiving premedication with midazolam and anaesthetic induction with sevoflurane, fentanyl and pancuronium were randomly allocated to two groups. In group 1, patients received bupivacaine 0.22% 4 mg.kg-1 (1.8 ml.kg-1) and morphine 150 microg x kg-1 by the caudal route. After a 20-min period for the block to take effect, sevoflurane 0.5-1.0% and fentanyl 5 microg x kg-1 were administered for maintenance of anaesthesia. In group 2, the anaesthetic technique was the same as in group 1, without a caudal block and fentanyl 25 microg x kg-1 was administered at the moment of surgical incision. RESULTS: Cardiovascular and haemodynamic responses of patients receiving caudal block showed minor variations during the 20-min period between caudal and general anaesthesia. Fentanyl requirements during surgery were lower (P = 0.001) in patients with caudal block than patients with general anaesthesia. Extubation time was shorter (P = 0.034) in the caudal group. Two patients in the general anaesthesia group and one in the caudal group died because of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Caudal block with bupivacaine 0.22% 4 mg.kg-1 (1.8 ml.kg-1) and morphine 150 microg x kg-1 was safe and effective for paediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, patients might have a better outcome with a reduction of morphine dosage and administration of a muscle relaxant of shorter duration of action than pancuronium.",eng,0

Unfortunately, despite many attempts of improvement, the treatment of acute postoperative pain remains unsatisfactory. In the present review, the probable reasons for this will be reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Based on the demonstration of specific, patients-related 'pain risk', individual pain trajectories and the importance of secondary hyperalgesia in the development of CPSP, new methods have to be applied in order to determine the real efficacy of new analgesic adjuvants. The key importance of the early inflammatory reaction in the genesis of the 'postoperative syndrome' and its close interaction with the mechanisms elicited by intraoperative opioid administration must also be outlined. SUMMARY: A single treatment approach is almost unlikely to solve the problem of CPSP. Consequently, the management of postoperative pain has to become more patients' specific and etiologies sensitive. 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.",English,0

Habib,2012.0,Transversus abdominis plane block for analgesia after Cesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1007/s12630-012-9729-1,"PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in improving analgesia following Cesarean delivery (CD). SOURCE: We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and CINAHL for randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of TAP block following CD and reported on postoperative pain scores and/or opioid consumption. Studies were combined according to the use or non-use of intrathecal morphine (ITM). Another analysis was performed for studies comparing TAP block with ITM. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nine studies were included. Transversus abdominis plane block significantly reduced opioid consumption (mg morphine equivalents) after Cesarean delivery at six hours (mean difference [MD] -10.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] -13.03 to -7.34), at 12 hr (MD -13.83; 95% CI -22.77 to -4.89), and at 24 hr (MD -20.23; 95% CI -33.69 to -6.77). The TAP block also reduced pain scores for up to 12 hr and nausea in patients who did not receive ITM. When added to ITM, TAP block produced a small reduction in pain scores on movement in the first six hours (MD -0.82, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.11). When compared with ITM, pain scores on movement and opioid consumption at 24 hr were lower (MD 0.98; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.91 and MD 8.42 mg; 95% CI 1.74 to 15.10, respectively), and time to first rescue analgesic was longer with ITM (8 hr vs 4 hr), although opioid-related side effects were more common. CONCLUSION: Transversus abdominis plane block significantly improved postoperative analgesia in women undergoing CD who did not receive ITM but showed no improvement in those who received ITM. Intrathecal morphine was associated with improved analgesia compared with TAP block alone at the expense of an increased incidence of side effects.",eng,1

Leiphart,2011.0,Successful peripheral nerve field stimulation for thoracic radiculitis following Brown-Sequard syndrome,10.1111/j.1525-1403.2011.00356.x,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to present a novel approach to the treatment of thoracic radiculitis following Brown-Sequard syndrome with peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS). Furthermore, we endeavor to discuss the role of PNFS in the management of refractory neuropathic pain conditions including post-traumatic and post-surgical neuropathy particularly with regards to the post-surgical spine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Presented is a 57-year-old man with history of thoracic microdiscectomy resulting in Brown-Sequard syndrome presented with chronic post-operative thoracic radicular pain radiating to the abdomen, refractory to conservative management. The patient underwent three intercostal nerve blocks from T7 to T9 with transient symptomatic relief. The patient's options were limited to chemomodulation, neuromodulation, or selective intercostal nerve surgical neurectomy. He subsequently underwent a PNFS trial and reported >75% pain reduction. Permanent percutaneous PNFS electrodes were implanted subcutaneously over the right T7 and T9 intercostal nerves and replicated the trial results. RESULTS: Neuromodulation produced pain relief with >90% improvement in pain compared with baseline both during the trial and following permanent implantation of the PNFS system. CONCLUSION: Chronic radicular pain may be difficult to manage in the post-surgical patient and often requires the use of multiple therapeutic modalities. In this case, we successfully utilized PNFS as it demonstrated greater technical feasibility when compared with dorsal column stimulation and repeat surgery; therefore, it may be considered for the management of post-surgical neuropathy. Further controlled studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of PNFS as a treatment option.",eng,0

There are very few randomized trials of its use in laparoscopic cholecystectomy in medical literature. This study was aimed at assessing its efficacy and opioid-sparing potential in this surgery. Methods: Fifty patients were included in this prospective randomized study and allocated to two groups: Group A (25 patients) receiving general anesthesia alone and Group B (25 patients) receiving nerve-stimulator-guided bilateral thoracic Paravertebral Block (PVB) at T6 level with 0.3 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine prior to induction of general anesthesia. Intraoperative analgesia was supplemented with fentanyl (0.5 mug/kg) based on hemodynamic and clinical parameters. Postoperatively, patients in both the groups received Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) morphine for the first 24 hours. The efficacy of PVB was assessed by comparing intraoperative fentanyl requirements, postoperative VAS scores at rest, and on coughing and PCA morphine consumption between the two groups. Results: Intraoperative supplemental fentanyl was significantly less in Group B compared to Group A (17.6 mug and 38.6 mug, respectively, P =0.001). PCA morphine requirement was significantly low in the PVB group at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively compared to that in Group A (4.4 mg vs 6.9 mg, 7.6 mg vs 14.2 mg, 11.6 mg vs 20.0 mg, 16.8 mg vs 27.2 mg, respectively; P <0.0001 at all intervals).

This study compares caudal block using bupivacaine/ketamine with dorsal nerve block of the penis. METHODS: Sixty boys undergoing elective circumcision were given either 0.5 ml x kg-1 of bupivacaine 0.15% with ketamine 0.5 mg x kg-1 (n = 30) or dorsal nerve block of the penis with bupivacaine 0.5% (n = 30) as a supplement to general anaesthesia. Postoperative pain was assessed by parents using a modified objective pain score, and the time taken to first requirement of analgesia was recorded. Motor weakness, time to first micturition, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), eating habits, sleep disturbance and behaviour were also assessed. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups in time to first requirement for analgesia or number of doses of paracetamol given in the first 24 h. Almost half the boys in the caudal group had motor weakness, and there was a significant increase in time to first micturition in that group. There was no difference between the groups in PONV, eating, sleeping or behavioural disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: Caudal anaesthesia with bupivacaine/ketamine does not confer any advantage over a dorsal nerve block with the doses used in this study. Because of the higher incidence of side-effects and technique failure in the caudal group, dorsal nerve block is perhaps the preferred technique.",eng,0

DESIGN: Double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: District general hospital in the UK. POPULATION: Women undergoing a laparoscopic hysterectomy for a benign indication. METHODS: Women were randomised to receive either 0.5% levobupivicaine or 0.9% normal saline via an ON-Q elastomeric pump for 48 hours postoperatively. The amount of opioids used via the patient-controlled analgesia pump was recorded and pain was measured using an 11-point Box Scale. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the amount of patient-administered morphine used over the first 48 postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, oral analgesia use and level of patient-reported pain. RESULTS: Sixty women participated and completed the trial. There was no difference (P = 0.59) in the median amount of patient-administered morphine used between the levobupivicaine (23 mg) and placebo (18.5 mg) groups; median group difference 3.0 (95% CI -7.0 to 14.0). There was also no difference in the length of hospital stay with 40% of the treatment group remaining in hospital >48 hours compared with 30% of the placebo group (P = 0.08). Pain scores at all postoperative time points remained similar, with a median group difference in pain scores of 1.0 (95% CI -1.0 to 2.0) at the end of the first postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of 0.5% levobupivicaine into the peritoneal cavity following laparoscopic hysterectomy does not have any opioid-sparing effects.",eng,1

The primary outcome of this study was the evaluation of the efficacy of TAP block on pain intensity following cesarean delivery with Pfannenstiel incision. METHODS: Fifty pregnant women were randomized blindly to receive either a TAP block with 15 ml 0.25% bupivacaine in both sides (group T, n = 25) or no blockade (group C, n = 25) at the end of the surgery, which was performed with a Pfannenstiel incision under general anesthesia. The pain intensity in the patients was assessed by a blinded investigator at the time of discharge from recovery and at 6, 12, and 24 h postoperatively, with a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain. RESULTS: The women in the TAP block group had significantly lower VAS pain scores at rest and during coughing and consumed significantly less tramadol than the women in group C [50 mg (0-150) vs. 250 mg (0-400), P = 0.001]. There was a significantly longer time to the first request for analgesic in the TAP block group [210 min (0-300) vs. 30 min (10-180) in group C, P = 0.0001]. CONCLUSION: Two-sided TAP block with 0.25% bupivacaine in parturients who undergo cesarean section with a Pfannenstiel incision under general anesthesia can decrease postoperative pain and analgesic consumption.

Andreae,2012.0,Local anaesthetics and regional anaesthesia for preventing chronic pain after surgery,10.1002/14651858.CD007105.pub2,"BACKGROUND: Regional anaesthesia may reduce the rate of persistent (chronic) pain after surgery, a frequent and debilitating condition. OBJECTIVES: To compare local anaesthetics and regional anaesthesia versus conventional analgesia for the prevention of persistent pain six or 12 months after surgery. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4), PubMed (1966 to April 2012), EMBASE (1966 to May 2012) and CINAHL (1966 to May 2012) without any language restriction. We used a combination of free text search and controlled vocabulary search. The results were limited to randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). We conducted a handsearch in reference lists of included trials, review articles and conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing local anaesthetics or regional anaesthesia versus conventional analgesia with a pain outcome at six or 12 months after surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, including information on adverse events. We contacted study authors for additional information. Results are presented as pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), based on random-effects models (inverse variance method). We grouped studies according to surgical interventions. We employed the Chi(2) test and calculated the I(2) statistic to investigate study heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 23 RCTs studying local anaesthetics or regional anaesthesia for the prevention of persistent (chronic) pain after surgery. Data from a total of 1090 patients with outcomes at six months and of 441 patients with outcomes at 12 months were presented. No study included children. We pooled data from 250 participants after thoracotomy, with outcomes at six months. Data favoured regional anaesthesia for the prevention of chronic pain at six months after thoracotomy with an OR of 0.33 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.56). We pooled two studies on paravertebral block for breast cancer surgery; the pooled data of 89 participants with outcomes at five to six months favoured paravertebral block with an OR of 0.37 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.94).The methodological quality of the included studies was intermediate. Adverse effects were not studied systematically and were reported sparsely. Clinical heterogeneity, attrition and sparse outcome data hampered the assessment of effects, especially at 12 months. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Epidural anaesthesia may reduce the risk of developing chronic pain after thoracotomy in about one patient out of every four patients treated. Paravertebral block may reduce the risk of chronic pain after breast cancer surgery in about one out of every five women treated. Our conclusions are significantly weakened by performance bias, shortcomings in allocation concealment, considerable attrition and incomplete outcome data. We caution that our evidence synthesis is based on only a few, small studies. More studies with high methodological quality, addressing various types of surgery and different age groups, including children, are needed.",eng,0

Bonnet,2005.0,Paravertebral block with ropivacaine 0.5% versus systemic analgesia for pain relief after thoracotomy,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2004.07.030,"PURPOSE: Paravertebral block in combination to intravenous analgesics could be an alternative to epidural analgesia for postoperative pain control after thoracotomy, but it has been scarcely evaluated so far. We thus assessed the efficacy of paravertebral block using a continuous infusion of ropivacaine in a multimodal analgesic approach. DESCRIPTION: Forty patients were randomized to receive ketoprofen, paracetamol, and patient-controlled-analgesia (PCA) with intravenous morphine (control group) or the same treatment with a continuous 48-hour infusion of ropivacaine 0.5% (0.1 mL/kg(-1)/h(-1)) in a thoracic paravertebral catheter (thoracic paravertebral block [TPVB] group). Visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and when coughing, morphine consumption, and side effects were recorded during the first 48 hours after surgery. Venous blood was sampled at 24 and 48 hours for ropivacaine plasma concentration measurements. EVALUATION: Mean VAS scores at rest and when coughing were significantly decreased in the TPBV group (p < 0.005). Despite a decrease in the morphine-titrated dose given in the postanesthesia care unit, cumulated morphine consumption was not significantly different between the two groups (51 +/- 29 mg and 57 +/- 24 mg in the TPVB and control groups, respectively). Side effects (nausea, vomiting, urinary retention) were less frequent in the TPBV group (30% vs 75%; p < 0.005). Plasma ropivacaine concentrations remained below the toxic threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous paravertebral ropivacaine 0.5% infusion improves pain control after thoracic surgery using a multimodal analgesic approach.",eng,1

Materials and methods: Between July 2007 and December 2009, 50 patients with stage III/IV of melanoma disease received, in an observational study, a systemic analgesic therapy. Of these patients, 30 were additionally treated with a subfascial catheter. Main outcome criterion was the pain under mobilisation at the first postoperative morning registered via a visual analogue score. Minor criteria were the analgesic requirement, the specific (surgical) complications and the day of discharge. Results: Patients treated with the subfascial catheter had significant less pain at the first postoperative morning in rest (p=0.02) and after mobilisation (p=0.03) without increased morbidity (p=0.45). Less patients of the treatment group needed a supplementary analgesic medication (p=0.01) and were able to leave hospital earlier than patients of the control group (p=0.01).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The subjects were parturients undergoing cesarean section under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. Morphine (2 mg) was administered to the epidural space close to the end of surgery. Women who desired TAP block were allocated to the TAP group. Women who did not undergo TAP block were allocated to the control group. In the TAP group, 20 mL of either 0.375% ropivacaine or 0.3% levobupivacaine was infused to both sides of the transversus abdominis plane after surgery. All patients were placed on a patient-controlled i.v. analgesia regimen with morphine after surgery. Time to the first morphine request and amount of morphine consumption within 24 h after surgery were compared in patients with and without TAP block. Plasma concentrations of local anesthetics were determined at 15, 30 and 60 min after TAP block. RESULTS: Forty and 54 patients were allocated to the control and TAP group, respectively. The median time to the first morphine request was longer (555 vs 215 min), and the median cumulative morphine consumption within 24 h was lower (5.3 vs 7.7 mg) in the TAP group than in the control group. The maximum median concentrations of ropivacaine and bupivacaine after TAP block were 784 and 553 ng/mL, respectively.

A prospective randomized controlled trial,10.4097/kjae.2013.64.6.511,"BACKGROUND: The ultrasound-guided oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane (OSTAP) block provides a wider area of sensory block to the anterior abdominal wall than the classical posterior approach. We compared the intra-operative analgesic efficacy of OSTAP block with conventional intravenous (IV) morphine during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: Forty adult patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under standard general anesthesia, were randomly assigned for either bilateral OSTAP block using 1.5 mg/kg ropivacaine on each side (n = 20) or IV morphine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 20). The intra-operative pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure were monitored every five minutes. Repetitive boluses of IV fentanyl 0.5 microg/kg were given as rescue analgesia when any of the above-mentioned parameters rose more than 15% from the baseline values. Time to extubation was documented. Additional boluses of IV morphine 0.05 mg/kg were administered in the recovery room if the recorded visual analogue score (VAS) was more than 4. Nausea and vomiting score, as well as sedation score were recorded. RESULTS: The morphine group required more rescue fentanyl as compared to the OSTAP block group but the difference was not significant statistically. Time to extubation was significantly shorter in the OSTAP block group (mean [SD] 10.4 [2.60] vs 12.4 [2.54] min; P = 0.021). Both methods provided excellent analgesia and did not differ in postoperative morphine requirements. No between-group differences in sedation score and incidence of nausea and vomiting were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided OSTAP block has an important role as part of balanced anesthesia. It is as efficacious as IV morphine in providing effective analgesia during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",eng,1

Rendon,2011.0,"Surgeon-administered regional anesthesia, using the transversus abdominal plane (TAP) block during radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP): A randomized double blinded, controlled trial",http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2011.02.572,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Pain is a significant concern for patients considering an open RRP. Our center's post-RRP analgesic protocol includes scheduled acetaminophen, ibuprofen, breakthrough narcotics and anticholenergic/opiate suppositories. This has allowed discharge of 96% of our patients within 48 hours. By injecting local anesthetic into the interfascial plane containing sensory spinal nerves, the TAP block anesthetizes the anterior abdominal wall. Traditionally performed by anesthetists via ultrasound, it has not been evaluated systematically in patients undergoing RRP. We present the results of a double-blinded, control trial of surgeon-administered TAP blocks in patients undergoing RRP. METHODS: After informed consent, 110 patients undergoing general anesthesia (GA) for RRP were randomized to blinded surgeon-administered bilateral TAP blocks using ropivicaine or saline injections. Blinded nursing staff recorded interval symptom scores (pain, nausea, sedation, and pruritis). Analgesic use, demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. Descriptive statistics, regression analyses, and repeated measures analysis were used. RESULTS: Of 110 patients, 16 were excluded due to chronic opiate use, or for requiring a secondary GA. Most patients had low/intermediate risk prostate cancer (low risk 43.1%, intermediate risk 41.9%). Total cases per surgeon ranged from 4 to 37 over the 10-month study period. Immediately following surgery, the TAP block arm reduced the total milligrams of opiates used by 28.7%, and the number of doses by 38.6% compared to the saline arm (p=0.02 and 0.046 respectively). At 24 hours, the intervention arm required 1/3 less opiate doses (p=0.023) compared to controls. Both static and dynamic pain were decreased by an average of 10% in the treatment arm (p=0.018, and 0.037 respectively) over 24hrs. Regression analysis identified one low volume surgeon, and longer operative time to negatively affect opiate requirements and pain scores. No side-effects were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: This double blinded randomized controlled trial, demonstrates that a surgeon-administered regional block during open RRP decreases pain and opiate requirements. Of men receiving this adjunct to GA, 20% required no post-op narcotics. With no documented side-effects, this block provides an effective and low risk addition to current multimodal anesthesia strategies.",English,0

METHODS: Seventy-five patients undergoing tonsillectomy received bilateral GNB with 0.75% ropivacaine with epinephrine (Group R), 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine (Group B) at the end of the operation, or no intervention (Group C). To evaluate the effects of GNB, we assessed throat pain (100 mm visual analog scale) and severity of gag reflex response 0.5, 8, and 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: In the immediate postoperative period, pain scores at rest and when swallowing in Groups R and B were significantly lower than those in Group C (21 +/- 17 and 23 +/- 13 vs 42 +/- 16, 28 +/- 22 and 32 +/- 19 vs 62 +/- 14, P < 0.001). The analgesic effect of GNB was strongly correlated with the extent of obtunded gag reflex (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: GNB is a useful method for the palliation of post-tonsillectomy pain. An obtunded gag reflex response may be a clinical indicator for analgesia from GNB.",eng,1

Howell,2009.0,Efficacy and safety of different techniques of paravertebral block for analgesia after thoracotomy: a systematic review and metaregression,10.1093/bja/aep272,"Various techniques and drug regimes for thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) have been evaluated for post-thoracotomy analgesia, but there is no consensus on which technique or drug regime is best. We have systematically reviewed the efficacy and safety of different techniques for PVB. Our primary aim was to determine whether local anaesthetic (LA) dose influences the quality of analgesia from PVB. Secondary aims were to determine whether choice of LA agent, continuous infusion, adjuvants, pre-emptive PVB, or addition of patient-controlled opioids improve analgesia. Indirect comparisons between treatment arms of different trials were made using metaregression. Twenty-five trials suitable for metaregression were identified, with a total of 763 patients. The use of higher doses of bupivacaine (890-990 mg per 24 h compared with 325-472.5 mg per 24 h) was found to predict lower pain scores at all time points up to 48 h after operation (P=0.006 at 8 h, P=0.001 at 24 h, and P<0.001 at 48 h). The effect-size estimates amount to around a 50% decrease in postoperative pain scores. Higher dose bupivacaine PVB was also predictive of faster recovery of pulmonary function by 72 h (effect-size estimate 20.1% more improvement in FEV1, 95% CI 2.08%-38.07%, P=0.029). Continuous infusions of LA predicted lower pain scores compared with intermittent boluses (P=0.04 at 8 h, P=0.003 at 24 h, and P<0.001 at 48 h). The use of adjuvant clonidine or fentanyl, pre-emptive PVB, and the addition of patient-controlled opioids to PVB did not improve analgesia. Further well-designed trials of different PVB dosage and drug regimes are needed.",eng,1

We compared a continuous subacromial infusion to a continuous interscalene block with levobupivacaine for patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuffsurgery. Methods: Sixty patients were randomized to two groups: 1) interscalene blockwith 0.5% levobupivacaine (30 mL) followed by a postoperative subacromial infusion: 0.125% levobupivacaine 5 mL/h basal infusion, 5 mL bolus dose and a 20 min lockout time or; 2) interscalene block with 0.5% levobupivacaine (30 mL) followed by a postoperative interscalene infusion: 0.125% levobupivacaine 5 mL/h basal infusion, 5 mL bolus dose and a 20 min lockout time. Infusions were maintained for 48 hours. Results: The VAS scores in the postanesthesia care unit and at 4 h were not different. The VAS scores at 8,12,24,36 and 48 h were lower than 4 in both groups; but they were significantly lower in the interscalene group. Additional analgesic requirements were lower in the interscalene group (16.6% vs 53.3%, p<0.05). Patients' satisfaction was higher in the interscalene group (9.4+0.8 vs 8+1.2, p<0.01). One patient had a toxicity related to interscalene block but; there was no complication related to subacromial catheters. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that subacromial infusions, although provided good postoperative analgesia, are not as effective as interscalene infusions and additional analgesics should be prescribed when subacromial infusions are started. Subacromial infusions could be considered as an alternative in case of any contraindication to interscalene block.",English,0

The regional technique used was not blinded. SETTING: A university teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for tumor resection. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either continuous extrapleural block or continuous epidural block using ropivacaine for a period of 60 hours after surgery. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: To evaluate postoperative pain control, the primary and secondary endpoints were the visual analog scale (VAS) on movement and the amount of rescue analgesia, respectively. There were no significant differences between the extrapleural and epidural block groups with regard to VAS at rest and during movement assessed at 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after surgery, dosage of intravenous morphine (extrapleural: 12.9 +/- 11.3, epidural: 10.2 +/- 6.9 mg), supplemental nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (extrapleural: 12/20, epidural: 11/20), postoperative ambulation (extrapleural: 18 at postoperative day [POD] 1 and 20 at POD 2, epidural: 19 at POD 1 and 20 at POD 2) and hospital stay after surgery (extrapleural: 12.7 +/- 6.3, epidural: 12.6 +/- 4.7 days). CONCLUSIONS: Although this study did not show the superiority of continuous extrapleural block relative to continuous epidural in VATS patients, the results suggest that both methods provided effective analgesia with a relatively small dose of rescue morphine. Although the analgesic effects of these techniques were comparable, extrapleural block has the advantage of safety and precise placement of the catheter and can be considered an alternative to epidural block in VATS patients.",eng,1

However, infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks have been described in paediatric patients both with nerve stimulation and ultrasound (US)-guidance. US-guidance reduces the risk of complications in supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks in adults. OBJECTIVE: To compare the success rate, complications and time of performance of US-guided supraclavicular vs infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty children, 5-15 years old, scheduled for upper limb surgery were divided into two randomized groups: group S (supraclavicular), n = 40, and group I (infraclavicular), n = 40. All blocks performed were exclusively US-guided, by a senior anaesthesiologist with at least 6 months of experience in US-guided blocks. For supraclavicular blocks the probe was placed in coronal-oblique-plane in the supraclavicular fossa and the puncture was in-plane (IP) from lateral to medial. For infraclavicular blocks the probe was placed parallel and below the clavicle and the puncture was out-of-plane. Ropivacaine 0.5% was administered up to a maximum of 0.5 ml x kg(-1) until appropriate US-guided-spread was achieved. Block duration and volumes of ropivacaine used (mean+/-1SD) in the supraclavicular approach were recorded. Success rate (mean +/- 1 SD, 95%confidence interval), complications rate and time to perform the block (two-tailed Student's test) were recorded both for supraclavicular and infraclavicular approaches. RESULTS: In the US-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks, the duration of the sensory block was 6.5 +/- 2 h and of the motor block was 4 +/- 1 h. The volume of ropivacaine used in this group was 6 +/- 2 ml. In group I, 88% of blocks achieved surgical anaesthesia without any supplemental analgesia compared with 95% in group S (P = 0.39; difference=7%; 95% CI: -10% to 24%). Failures in group I were because of arterial puncture and insufficient ulnar or radial sensory block. Failures in group S were because of insufficient ulnar sensory block. No pneumothorax or Horner's syndrome was recorded in either group. The mean time (SD) to perform the block was in group I: 13 min (range 5-16) and in group S: 9 min (range 7-12); the 95% CI for this difference was 2-6 min and was statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: (i) Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular and infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks are effective in children. (ii) There has been no pneumothorax in 40 US-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks performed by anaesthesiologists already trained in US-guided regional anaesthesia using an IP technique in children > or =5 years old.

The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficiency of ultrasound (USG)-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with local anesthetic infiltration on a wound site. Methods: This study was designed as a prospective randomized trial, and consisted of 70 pregnant women of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-II. Patients were randomized into Group I (wound site infiltration, n=35) and Group T (TAP block, n=35). Spinal anaesthesia was administered to all patients. In Group I, wound site infiltration was applied by the surgical team. In Group T, a USG-guided bilateral TAP block was applied. Patients' numeric pain scale (NPS) levels at 2, 6, 12 and 24<sup>th</sup> hours, after the operation (NPS<sub>0</sub>) and during mobilization were assessed.

Bupivacaine is used for PVB at higher concentrations (0.5%), which may lead to systemic toxicity after absorption. Therefore, we proposed to evaluate the efficacy of lower concentrations of bupivacaine with and without fentanyl for thoracic PVB in patients undergoing surgery for carcinoma breast. Methods: Forty-eight patients scheduled for surgery for breast cancer were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial and were allocated to one of four groups: 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 5 mcg/ ml, 0.25% bupivacaine + epinephrine 5 mcg/ ml with 2 mcg/ml fentanyl, 0.5% bupivacaine + epinephrine 5 mcg/ml or isotonic saline. PVB was performed and 0.3 ml/kg of the test drug was administered before induction of general anaesthesia. The primary outcome assessed was post-operative analgesic requirement for a period of 24 h. Secondary outcome measures were post-operative pain scores at rest and on movement of the arm, latency to first opioid, post-operative nausea and vomiting, quality of sleep, ability to move arm and patient satisfaction. Results: The patient characteristics and anaesthetic technique were comparable among the groups. The rescue analgesic consumption as well as cumulative pain scores at rest and on movement were significantly less in 0.25% bupivacaine+epinephrine with fentanyl and 0.5% bupivacaine+epinephrine groups (P<0.05). The average duration of analgesia was found to be 18 h after either 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine+fentanyl or 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine. Conclusions: Lower concentrations of bupivacaine can be combined with fentanyl to achieve analgesic efficacy similar to bupivacaine at higher concentrations, decreasing the risk of toxicity in PVB.",English,1

Methods: This double-blinded, placebo-controlled study enrolled 69 patients scheduled for enucleation. Patients were stratified into two groups: those who used daily analgesics before surgery and those who did not. Each group was randomly assigned to receive a preincisional retrobulbar injection containing either a mixture of bupivacaine, lidocaine, epinephrine, and hyaluronidase; or saline placebo. All patients received postoperative retrobulbar injection containing the analgesic mixture. The outcome measures were intraoperative and postoperative blood pressure, heart rate. postoperative pain, and pain medication consumption. Results: Groups that received preincisional analgesia had a significantly lower mean intraoperative blood pressure (109/59 versus 127/69 mm Hg; P<0.05). Visual analog scale pain assessment (VAS) was lower in both treatment groups upon recovery room entry (VAS, 0.3 versus 15.8, P=0.08) and after 30 minutes in the nonanalgesic use group (VAS, 5.6 versus 19.4, P=0.11). Among nonchronic analgesic users, fewer patients in the treatment group had pain requiring analgesic rescue in the recovery room (5% versus 25%, P=0.08). Postoperative pain medicine consumption in the first 24 hours did not differ significantly among the groups. Conclusions: Preemptive retrobulbar analgesia was associated with improved intraoperative hemodynamics during enucleation and a trend toward reduced pain on entry in the recovery room and fewer pain rescues in the early postoperative period. A trend toward reduced pain severity in the early postoperative period was observed in those patients without daily preoperative analgesic use.",English,1

We hypothesized that LIA would offer equal analgesic efficacy but less adverse effects, e.g., nausea and vomiting, when compared with an established regimen [intrathecal morphine (it-M)] after THA. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial comprised 60 patients undergoing THA under spinal anaesthesia. For LIA, the surgeon administered levobupivacaine, ketorolac and epinephrine at the surgical site intraoperatively. LIA patients received a LIA top-up through a wound catheter on the morning of the 1st post-operative day (POD). In group it-M, 0.1 mg morphine was given together with the spinal anaesthetic. Study parameters included pain scores, vital parameters and side effects, e.g., post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Besides, levobupivacaine plasma concentrations were determined in 10 LIA patients. RESULTS: The median (25th/75th percentiles) rescue oxycodone demand differed significantly with LIA 15 (10/25) mg vs. 8.5 (1.5/15) mg with it-M (P < 0.006) during the day of surgery, but not anymore on 1st or 2nd POD. The LIA top-up had no effect. However, both analgesic regimens resulted in comparable pain scores and patient satisfaction. PONV incidence and medication did not vary significantly. LIA offered certain advantages regarding early post-operative mobilization. Maximum levobupivacaine plasma concentrations (229-580 ng/ml) remained under the toxic level. CONCLUSIONS: While LIA might enable earlier mobilization after THA, it was not associated with less nausea as compared with it-M. Less rescue oxycodone was given early after it-M, but urinary retention was more common in that group.",eng,0

The postoperative analgesic efficacy of a paracervical blockade (PCB) as an adjunct to general anesthesia (GA) during outpatient abortion (dilatation and curettage) is unclear, and the present study was initiated to evaluate if PCB is of significant importance per- or postoperatively. Methods. Two hundred women (aged 18-49 years) were assigned to one of four groups; group 1 received vaginal prostaglandin (PG) (PGE<sub>1</sub>, gemeprost 1 mg) for softening of the cervix preoperatively and surgery was performed in GA, group 2 received preoperative PG and surgery was performed in GA + PCB; group 3 did not receive PG treatment and surgery was performed in GA and group 4 were subjected to GA + PCB without preoperative PG. Results. Women receiving preoperative prostaglandin treatment (groups 1 and 2) reported significantly higher pain intensity already preoperatively, but also postoperatively as compared to patients not treated with PG. The patients subjected to prostaglandin treatment (groups 1 and 2) also had a significantly higher consumption of analgesics as compared to non-PG treated groups (3 and 4). The addition of PCB did not influence pre- and postoperative pain intensity significantly or consumption of analgesics. Patients receiving PG also reported significantly more nausea than the others although nausea was of low intensity. Patients receiving PG were, however, discharged earlier than the others from the hospital. Conclusions. Preoperative treatment of the cervix with prostaglandins was associated with significantly higher pain intensity both pre- and postoperatively, and increased need for analgesics postoperatively and more intense nausea. PCB given just before surgery did not result in significant postoperative analgesia. More efficient techniques for pain control should be developed for women subjected to first trimester abortion with preoperative PG treatment.",English,1

The majority of studies have evaluated the use of DPNB prior to circumcision in the pediatric population. To date, few studies have examined the role of DPNB prior to inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) implantation. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of local penile nerve block prior to IPP implantation for post-operative pain control. METHODS: Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Patients with erectile dysfunction scheduled for IPP implantation were approached for study participation. Patients were excluded if they had a previous IPP scheduled for revision or replacement or were undergoing additional procedures during the same operative session (manual modeling, concomitant artificial urinary sphincter placement, etc.). Patients were then randomized to either DPNB with a 50/50 mixture of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine without epinephrine or injectable saline placebo. Only the Resident surgeon assisting in the case was aware of randomization. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon (CCC). Postoperatively, patients were asked to rate their pain using a Visual Analog Scale hourly while in recovery, at 4 hours, and at 23 hours postoperatively. Total narcotic usage was also measured. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients underwent randomization with 9 patients in each group. Baseline demographic data were similar in each group. There was a statistically significant reduction in postoperative pain at 4 hours in the treatment group compared to placebo (VAS 1.7 vs. 5.8, p=0.0004). Immediate postoperative pain in the recovery area approached statistical significance in the treatment versus placebo groups (VAS 2.6 vs. 5.3, p=0.06). Narcotic usage was similar among both groups. There were no perioperative or early postoperative complications in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Dorsal penile nerve block is safe and effective for reducing pain in the early postoperative period following penile prosthesis implantation.",English,0

Nystrom,2008.0,Randomized clinical trial of stapled haemorrhoidopexy performed under local perianal block versus general anaesthesia,10.1002/bjs.6379,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to assess the feasibility of performing stapled haemorrhoidopexy under local anaesthesia. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with haemorrhoid prolapse were randomized to receive local or general anaesthesia. The perianal block was applied immediately peripheral to the external sphincter. Submucosal block was added after applying the purse-string suture. Patients reported average and peak pain daily for 14 days using a visual analogue scale (VAS). They also completed anal symptom questionnaires before the operation and at follow-up. The surgeon assessed the restoration of the anal anatomy 3-6 months after surgery. RESULTS: The anal block was sufficient in all patients. The mean accumulated VAS score for average pain was 23.1 in the general anaesthesia group and 29.4 in the local anaesthesia group (P = 0.376); mean peak pain scores were 42.1 and 47.9 respectively (P = 0.537). Mean change in symptom load was also similar between the groups, with score differences of 7.0 in the general anaesthesia group and 6.1 in the local anaesthesia group. No patient had a recurrence of prolapse. CONCLUSION: Perianal local block is easy to apply with a high degree of acceptability among patients. Postoperative pain, restoration of anatomy and symptom resolution were similar to that of stapled haemorrhoidopexy performed under general anaesthesia.

A prospective double-blind study. 60 pediatric patients aged 1-24 months, ASA II, III scheduled for thoracotomy were randomly allocated into two groups. After induction of general anesthesia, thoracic epidural catheter was inserted in group E (epidural) patients and thoracic paravertebral catheter was inserted in group P (paravertebral) patients. Post operative pain score was recorded hourly for 24 hours. Plasma cortisol level was recorded at three time points. Tidal breathing analysis was done preoperatively and 6 hours postoperatively. Analgesia, serum cortisol level, and pulmonary function parameters were comparable in the two groups. However, failure rate (incorrect placement of catheter) was significantly higher in epidural group than in paravertebral group (7% versus 0%, respectively). The complications were also significantly higher in epidural group (vomiting 14.8%, urine retention 11.1% and hypotension 14.8%) than paravertebral group (0%, 0%, and 3.6%, respectively). We conclude that both thoracic paravertebral block and thoracic epidural block results in comparable pain score and pulmonary function after thoracotomy in pediatric patients; the paravertebral block is associated with significantly less failure rate and side effects.",eng,1

A best evidence topic,10.1016/j.ijsu.2013.05.039,"A best evidence topic was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed whether local anaesthetic infiltration of the transversus abdominis plane (TAP block) during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy improves pain control. Ten papers were found using the reported search, of which four represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group, study type, relevant outcomes and key results of these papers were tabulated. Three of the randomised controlled trials demonstrated a reduction in analgesic requirements associated with TAP blocks following laparoscopic cholecystectomy as compared to placebo. The remaining randomised study compared TAP blocks with local anaesthetic infiltration of laparoscopic port sites and showed no significant difference in clinical outcomes between these two techniques. We conclude that there is good evidence that TAP block in laparoscopic cholecystectomy leads to a reduction in pain scores and analgesic requirement, however there is no significant difference when compared to local anaesthetic infiltration of trocar insertion sites.",eng,1

The ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block provides excellent pain relief for operations on the inguinal region, including emergency procedures (e.g. strangulated inguinal hernia with intestinal obstruction). It should be preferred to caudal block for these procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After local ethics committee approval and written parental consent, 67 ASA class I - II patients aged between 2-7 years old scheduled for elective inguinal hernia repair were allocated randomly into two groups after general anesthesia with same drugs in both groups. Group C received caudal block with 1 ml/kg bupivacaine 0.25% combined with 1 mug/kg clonidine, and group I received ilioinguinal- iliohypogastric nerve block with 0.3 ml /kg bupivacaine 0.25% combined with 1 mug/kg clonidine. Blood pressure and heart rate were documented every 5 minutes. Post-operative analgesia, analgesic use and side-effects were assessed during first 24 hours. RESULTS: In group C, 7 / 34 and in group I, 12/33 patients required post-operative analgesia (P = 0.174). Five patients (15.5%) in group I and one patient (2.94%) in group C had severe pain after operation. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased during operation, but the differences between two groups were not significant (P = 0.176, P = 0.111). Heart rate changes between two groups were insignificant (P = 0.182). CONCLUSION: It seems that in children, caudal epidural block and ilioinguinal - iliohypogastric nerve block using bupivacaine-clonidine have comparable effects on analgesia, severity of pain and hemodynamic changes during and after surgery on inguinal region.",eng,1

Methods: We recruited parturients undergoing elective caesareans for this multicenter study. Following written informed consent, they received a spinal anaesthetic without intrathecal morphine for their caesarean section. The postoperative analgesia was randomized to either a bilateral ultrasound guided TAP block (levobupivicaine = 150 mg) or a CWI through an elastomeric pump for 48 hours (levobupivacaine = 150 mg the first day and 12.5 mg/h thereafter). Every woman received regular analgesics along with oral morphine if required. The primary outcome was comparison of the 48-hour area under the curve (AUC) pain scores. Secondary outcomes included morphine consumption, adverse events, and persistent pain one month postoperatively. Results: Recruitment of 120 women was planned but the study was prematurely terminated due to the occurrence of generalized seizures in one patient of the TAP group. By then, 36 patients with TAP and 29 with CWI had completed the study. AUC of pain at rest and during mobilization were not significantly different: 50 [22.5-80] in TAP versus 50 [27.5-130] in CWI (P = 0.4) and 190 [130-240] versus 160 [112.5-247.5] (P = 0.5), respectively. Morphine consumption (0 [0-20] mg in the TAP group and 10 [0-32.5] mg in the CWI group (P = 0.09)) and persistent pain at one month were similar in both groups (respectively 29.6% and 26.6% (P = 0.73)). Conclusion: In cases of morphine-free spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery, no difference between TAP block and CWI for postoperative analgesia was suggested. TAP block may induce seizures in this specific context. Consequently, such a technique after a caesarean section cannot be recommended.

Journal Article,M. R. Guilfoyle; A. Helmy; D. Duane; P. J. Hutchinson,2013.0,Regional scalp block for postcraniotomy analgesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis,10.1213/ANE.0b013e3182863c22,"BACKGROUND: Up to two-thirds of patients report moderate to severe surgical site pain after craniotomy procedures, and there is understandable reluctance to manage these symptoms with systemic opioids that may impair neurological assessment. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus and evidence concerning alternative analgesia strategies for cranial neurosurgery. Regional scalp block (RSB) is an established technique that involves infiltration of local anesthetic (LA) at well-defined anatomical sites targeting the major sensory innervation of the scalp. However, the efficacy of RSB in reducing postoperative pain remains unclear. In this study, we sought to systematically identify and review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of RSB and synthesize an overall estimate of efficacy in a quantitative meta-analysis. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for all RCTs evaluating the effect of RSB on postoperative pain after craniotomy. Titles, abstracts, and papers were reviewed independently by 2 authors against predefined inclusion criteria. Two authors independently assessed the quality of included studies and extracted data on patient-reported pain scores, other analgesia requirements, and complications of RSB. Pain scores were scaled to a common 0 to 10 interval with higher scores indicating more severe pain. Meta-analysis of the pooled treatment effect was performed with a random-effects inverse-variance weighted model; heterogeneity was quantified with the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: The literature search identified 138 unique citations, from which 7 RCTs with a total recruitment of 320 patients met the inclusion criteria. All studies used standard LA drugs (lidocaine, bupivacaine, or ropivacaine); in 3 studies, LA was combined with epinephrine. In 3 studies, RSB was performed preoperatively; in the other 4 studies, it was administered postoperatively after wound closure. No complications attributable to RSB were reported. Meta-analysis found a pooled reduction in pain score at 1 hour postoperatively (N = 5 studies; mean difference, -1.61; 95% confidence interval, -2.06 to -1.15; P < 0.001; I(2) = 0%). Subgroup analysis of preoperative RSB showed significant reduction in pain scores at 2, 4, and 6 to 8 hours after surgery whereas postoperative RSB was associated with significant reduction in pain scores at 2, 4, 6 to 8 and 12 hours assessments. There was also an overall reduction in the opioid requirements over the first 24 hours postoperatively, although with significant heterogeneity among the studies (N = 6 studies; standardized mean difference, -0.79; 95% confidence interval, -1.55 to -0.03; P = 0.04; I(2) = 86%). CONCLUSION: Published RCTs of RSB are small and of limited methodological quality but meta-analysis shows a consistent finding of reduced postoperative pain. This evidence supports the use of RSB for patients undergoing craniotomy.",eng,1

Objective: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effects of anesthetic techniques on phantom pain, phantom sensations, and stump pain after lower limb amputation. Methods: Ninety-two patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to III were analyzed for 1 to 24 months after lower limb amputation in this retrospective study. Patients received general, spinal, or epidural anesthesia or peripheral nerve block for their amputations. Standardized questions were used to assess phantom limb pain, phantom sensation, and stump pain postoperatively. Pain intensity was assessed on a numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10. Patients' medical histories were determined from hospital records. Results: Patients who received epidural anesthesia and peripheral nerve block perceived significantly less pain in the week after surgery compared with patients who received general anesthesia and spinal anesthesia (NRS [SD] values, 2.68 [1.0] and 2.70 [1.0], respectively). After approximately 14 to 17 months, there was no difference in phantom limb pain, phantom sensation, or stump pain among the anesthetic techniques for amputation. Conclusions: In patients undergoing lower limb amputation, performing epidural anesthesia or peripheral nerve block, instead of general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia, might attenuate phantom and stump pain in the first week after operation. Anesthetic technique might not have an effect on phantom limb pain, phantom sensation, or stump pain at 14 to 17 months after lower limb amputation. 2011 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.",English,0

Subjective pain relief was assessed on a linear visual analogue scale. Pulmonary function was measured on the day before operation and daily for five days after surgery. Eight patients received bupivacaine and eight placebo (saline). The mean pain scores at 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours were 13.3, 8.5, 6.1, and 10 mm respectively in the bupivacaine group compared with 56.3, 41, 46.7, and 35 in the control group; in addition, the bupivacaine group required less papaveretum. Twenty four hours after surgery mean values of peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced vital capacity were reduced to 82%, 76%, and 76% of preoperative control values in the bupivacaine group, and to 39%, 32%, and 36% in the control group. The speed of recovery of pulmonary function was superior in the bupivacaine group. There were no complications related to the infusion.

Forty-eight recipients were randomized to receive TAP block under ultrasound guidance after induction of anaesthesia with either 20 ml of levobupivacaine 0.5% (TAP group, n=24) or 20 ml of 0.9% normal saline (control group, n=24). After operation, all patients received paracetamol 1 g i.v. or orally every 6 h and patient-controlled analgesia delivering morphine 0.5 mg every 10 min i.v. on demand. The primary objective was to study morphine consumption in the first 24 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes included assessment of the degree of sedation, respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, and pruritus. Pain scores (visual analogue scale 0-10) were measured by nursing staff blinded to the randomization, in theatre recovery, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after operation in the ward. All variables were compared between the two groups using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Two patients were excluded from the TAP group due to protocol violation. Fentanyl and morphine consumption were similar intraoperatively in both groups. There was no difference in pain scores between the two groups in the recovery room, but morphine consumption [mean (SD)] at this time in the TAP group was less than the control group [2.2 (3.75) vs 4.1 (2.8) mg, P=0.009].

METHODS: Following Ethical Committee approval and informed consent 90 patients scheduled for hemorrhoidectomy were randomized to three different groups of 30 patients each: general anesthesia alone, general anesthesia plus nerve stimulator guided pudendal nerve block or general anesthesia plus placebo nerve blocks. Postoperative pain, the primary outcome variable of the study, was assessed by visual analogue scale scores at predetermined time intervals during the postoperative period. Total amount of analgesics, time to return to normal activities and patient satisfaction were also recorded. RESULTS: The pudendal nerve block group was found to have better postoperative pain-relief (P < 0.005), reduced need for analgesics (P < 0.05), and also a more rapid return to normal activities (P < 0.001) compared to general anesthesia alone or in combination with placebo blocks. The pudendal nerve block group was also associated with significantly higher patient satisfaction (P < 0.001) compared to the other two groups. CONCLUSION: A combination of general anesthesia and nerve stimulator guided pudendal nerve block showed significantly reduced postoperative pain, shortened hospital stay, and earlier return to normal activity. Thus, this technique deserves more widespread use in patients undergoing hemorrhoidectomy.",eng,1

This study was designed to compare the cost-effectiveness of an IHNB-MAC technique with standardized general and spinal anesthetics techniques for inguinal herniorrhaphy in the ambulatory setting. We randomly assigned 81 consenting outpatients to receive IHNB-MAC, general anesthesia, or spinal anesthesia. We evaluated recovery times, 24-h postoperative side effects and associated incremental costs. Compared with general and spinal anesthesia, patients receiving IHNB-MAC had the shortest time-to-home readiness (133+/-68 min vs. 171+/-40 and 280+/-83 min), lowest pain score at discharge (15+/-14 mm vs. 39+/-28 and 34+/-32 mm), and highest satisfaction at 24-h follow-up (75% vs. 36% and 64%). The total anesthetic costs were also the least in the IHNB-MAC group ($132.73+/-33.80 vs. $172.67+/-29.82 and $164.97+/-31.03). We concluded that IHNB-MAC is the most cost-effective anesthetic technique for outpatients undergoing unilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy with respect to speed of recovery, patient comfort, and associated incremental costs.",eng,1

Visceral afferent input and a large abdominal wound contribute to significant postoperative pain. We examined the opiod-sparing efficacy of the ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block as part of a multimodal postoperative analgesic regimen after a standard general anaesthetic in which women received a PCA morphine device immediately after surgery and regular oral acetaminophen and NSAIDs from the 2<sup>nd</sup> postoperative day. Methods: After IRB approval and written consent, 40 ASA I-III women who underwent major gynaecological oncology surgery were randomized to receive the TAP block with local anaesthetic or no TAP block. Patients in the study group received 20ml of levobupivicaine 2.5mg/ml deposited into the transversus abdominis plane under ultrasound guidance, using a Sonosite Titan, 7-13MHz linear transducer and a 22 Gauge 70mm Pajunk needle. Both groups received PCA morphine (bolus 1mg, lockout time 5min, maximum 10mg/h). We recorded 24 hour morphine consumption; pain scores at rest and activity, sedation, nausea and vomiting, use of anti-emetic medication at 2,4,6,12,24hrand overall maternal satisfaction.

Therefore, the authors investigated the efficacy of a continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.25% or 0.5%, at the median sternotomy site, for 48 h after cardiac surgery in reducing the opioid analgesic requirement and improving the recovery process. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, 36 consenting patients undergoing open-heart surgery with a standardized general anesthetic technique had two indwelling infusion catheters placed at the median sternotomy incision site at the end of surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to receive normal saline (control), bupivacaine 0.25% or bupivacaine 0.5% via an elastomeric infusion pump at a constant rate of 4 ml/h for 48 h. Patients evaluated their chest pain using an 11-point verbal rating scale, with 0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain imaginable. In addition, the postoperative opioid analgesic requirements and opioid-related adverse effects were recorded. Patient satisfaction with their pain management was assessed at specific intervals during the postoperative period using a 100-point verbal rating scale, with 1 = highly dissatisfied to 100 = highly satisfied. Finally, serum bupivacaine concentrations were measured 24 and 48 h after surgery. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, there was a statistically significant reduction in verbal rating scale pain scores and patient-controlled analgesia morphine use in the bupivacaine-0.5% group. Patient satisfaction with their pain management was also improved in the bupivacaine-0.5% (vs. control) group. However, there were no significant differences in patient-controlled analgesia morphine use between the bupivacaine-0.25% and control groups. Although the duration of the intensive care unit stay (30 vs. 34 h, respectively) was not significantly decreased, the time to ambulation (1 +/- 0.5 vs. 2 +/- 1 days, respectively) and the duration of hospital stay (4.2 vs. 5.7 days, respectively) were lower in the bupivacaine-0.5% group than in the control group. Mean +/- SD serum bupivacaine concentrations at 48 h in the bupivacaine-0.25% and bupivacaine-0.5% groups were 0.5 +/- 0.5 and 1.3 +/- 0.7 microg/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION: A continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.5% at 4 ml/h is effective for decreasing pain and the need for opioid analgesic medication as well as for improving patient satisfaction with their pain management after cardiac surgery. Patients in the bupivacaine-0.5% group were able to ambulate earlier, leading to a reduced length of hospital stay.",eng,0

Methods: Sixty adult patients, aged 25-65 years, ASA status I-III, undergoing lateral thoracotomy for lower oesophageal surgeries were studied. They were divided randomly into 3 equal groups (n = 20 each): group I (thoracic epidural group), group II (paravertebral group) and group III (interpleural block with wound infiltration). Subjective pain relief was assessed by visual analogue scale. Pulmonary functions were assessed by FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and PEFR. Stress response was assessed by measurement of plasma glucose and cortisol levels. Results: The results of this study showed that in the first postoperative day, pulmonary function tests were best in group II, while groups I and III were comparable. In the 2nd postoperative day, group II also had the best pulmonary functions, while group III had the worst pulmonary functions. VAS scores were least in group II. Also, the narcotic consumption was least in group II, which also showed the least increase in glucose and cortisol levels. Conclusion: It was concluded that paravertebral block is the best method for post-thoracotomy pain relief and that the addition of wound infiltration to interpleural block improved markedly the pain relief of this technique in the first postoperative day. This combination was comparable to extradural block with more preservation of pulmonary functions.",English,0

Jacques,2010.0,Continuous L2 paravertebral block vs. continuous lumbar plexus block for postoperative analgesia after total hip arthroplasty: A blinded interim analysis,", http://ovidsp.ovid.com/athens?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed10&AN=70736157","Background: Lumbar plexus block has long been an accepted technique for pain management after THR. It provides effective analgesia for total hip arthroplasty, reducing intra- and postoperative opioid requirements. (Stevens, et al., 2000).And while mostly favorable postoperative analgesia has been demonstrated over intravenous opiods, these blocks may not produce effective postoperative analgesia or may lead to excessive motor blockade(Chudinov, et al., 1999). Motor blockade is deleterious following hip surgery as it will inhibit progress with postoperative physical therapy and ambulation and may predispose to patient falls. Recently the use of a L2 paravertebral block has been described as an effective postoperative analgesic technique in the case of hip arthroscopy (Lee, et al., 2008). The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare these two approaches to blockade of the lumbar plexus with respect to the associated morphine consumption and motor blockade. Method: After approval by the Institutional Review Board, 16, ASA I-III patients aged 18-75 years, with BMI less than 40, meeting inclusion criteria were recruited and randomized to one of the two study groups on the day of surgery. These patients were scheduled to undergo elective primary hip replacement surgery all by one orthopedic surgeon at UPMC-Shadyside Hospital in Pittsburgh, PA The study groups are defined as: a. Group I: L2 Paravertebral approach group (n=7) b. Group II: Posterior Lumbar Plexus approach (n=9). The nerve blocks were performed as indicated. Continuous catheters were placed in both the groups. Adequate block was tested after 20 minutes. The anesthetic regimen for both groups was identical using spinal anesthesia.In the recovery room, bupivacaine 0.0625% was started at 10 ml/h. The patients in both groups were also be given access to PCA Morphine (1 mg bolus, 8 minutes lock out, no basal infusion, 6 mg one hour limit) once verbal pain score is < 4.. PCA morphine was continued for 24 hours. Once on the floor, additional pain relief was available via nurse-administered 5 ml boluses of bupivacaine 0.0625% via catheter pump given no more than hourly. In addition, nurse-administered intravenous bolus of Morphine 3 every 30 min as needed up to 2 doses while the patient has a PCA was ordered. Morphine consumption, pain scores TUG test along with motor/sensory examination were recorded 24hours after completion of surgery. The timed get up and go test is a measurement of mobility, For the test, the person is asked to stand up from a standard chair and walk a distance of approximately 10 feet (measure as 3 meters), turn around and walk back to the chair and sit down again. The time taken to complete the task are noted. Result: No significant differences were detected between the lumbar plexus and L2 paravertebral groups in 24-h pain scores during PT (visual analogue scale, 5.8 A+ 2.77 mm vs. 5.6 A+ 3.05 mm ( P >0.05 ). Mean morphine usage in the lumbar plexus group was 28.1 A+ 17.32 mg compared with 26.2A+ 19.80 mg in the L2 Paravertebral group (P >0.05).Mobility as assessed by the TUG(timed up and go) test performed by physical therapy was similar between groups(78.9 A+ 27.73 vs 92.2 A+ 18.24 sec). Discussion: Combined L1, L2 single shot paravertebral blocks were performed and evaluated by Lee et al in hip arthroscopy patients to facilitate pain control and mitigate hip flexor/quadriceps weakness, commonly observed with a lumbar plexus block.In this study we are attempting to compare these two techniques by using continuous L2 paravertebral and lumbar plexus block in total hip replacements. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that L2 Paravertebral and lumbar plexus blocks provide a similar postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing THR. L2 paravertebrals were associated with less motor weakness when compared to the Lumbar plexus group.",English,0

Indications for hip arthroscopy include degenerative changes of the labrum, the ligamentum capitis femoris or the cartilage; femoroacetabular impingement, synovial disorders or infections of the joint. Effective postoperative analgesia for these procedures, avoiding epidural catheters has been a challenging issue in our center. Aim: To compare three different models of analgesia for arthroscopic hip surgery and to determine if any of them provides better analgesia and fewer side effects. Method: After approval of the ethics committee, we randomly assigned 56 ASA I or II patients undergoing arthroscopic hip surgery to 3 different groups. In the first group (n=21) a lumbar plexus block was performed before induction. The second group of patients (n=18) received lumbarand parasacral sciatic nerve block and the third group (n=17) underwent general anesthesia, without any regional block, receiving instead 100 mug/Kg morphine. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia. After surgery patients had the same analgesic regime consisting of a ketorolac infusion (90 mg/24h), acetaminophen (500 mg/6h) and morphine (PCA). A blinded anesthesiologist evaluated rest and dynamic pain scores, morphine consumption, urinary retention, sedation, nausea and pruritus during 24 hours after surgery. Results: No statistical differences were found among groups regarding rest and dynamic pain scores. However, higher levels of sedation were present in the morphine group compared to lumbar plexus block group (p < 0.05). Also, urinary retention reached statistical significance in the morphine group compared to lumbar and parasacral sciatic block group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our study showed that satisfactory analgesia ( < 4 in a numeric scale from 0-10) after hip arthroscopic surgery can be achieved using both peripheral blocks (lumbar alone or lumbar plus parasacral) or endovenous morphine. However, the risks ofurinary retention orhigher levels ofsedation are increased in the morphine group.",English,0

We assess the analgesic efficacy of TAP block up to 8 days of the postoperative period as unique analgesic, compared with morphine epidural for the cesarean delivery. Methods: A prospective, randomized study, prior informed consent and Institutional Review Board approval, was made in 40 healthy patients with term pregnancy scheduled for elective cesarean section, divided into two groups: Morphine Group (n = 20) and TAP Group (n = 20). All patients received epidural block with 400 mgs. of 2% lidocaine plus epinephrine 1:200,000. At the end of the surgery, morphine group were administered 1.5 mgs. of epidural morphine; in TAP group was performed bilaterally ultrasound guided TAP block with 75 mgs. of ropivacaine at 0.325% (20 ml volume) on each side. The intensity of pain was evaluated at 4, 12, 24, 48 hours and 8 days of the postoperative using Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The Wilcoxon test and the Pearson coefficient for study of correlations were chosen for the validation of comparisons. Results: Demographic parameters were homogeneous in both groups. On measurements of pain post operative VAS average were lower than 3 in both groups, without a statistically significant difference. The average of VAS was greater in the group of epidural morphine: 2.7, and 0.95 in the transverse plane block group at 48 hours (P = 0. 002). The 4 hrs., 12 hrs., 24 hrs. and 8 days averages of VAS did not increase in the TAP group, reported no significant differences (P gt; 0.05); while in the morphine group was presented a slight increase in the scale of VAS at the 24 hrs., although without being significant. Discussion: The use of the ultrasound guided TAP block for postoperative analgesia in cesarean section offers an adequate pain control, keeping average of EVA low with the passage of time from 48 hours up to 8 days compared to the use of epidural morphine postoperative.

http://ovidsp.ovid.com/athens?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=2012741835","Background. Patients with severe cardiovascular disease are frequently hemodynamically unstable during abdominal surgery. Improving the safety of such patients by stabilizing intraoperative hemodynamics remains a major concern for anesthesiologists. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in combination with general anesthesia may facilitate optimum anesthetic management of these high-risk patients. Methods. Patients with cardiovascular disease classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 3 were enrolled. The patients were undergoing elective abdominal surgery and were randomized to a group receiving general anesthesia and TAP block (Group T, N.=33) or a group receiving general anesthesia alone (Group G, N.=35). We compared the groups for intraoperative hemodynamic stability, anesthesia emergence time, amounts of anesthetics and opioids given, and frequency of emergency treatment with cardiovascular agents. A preliminary study demonstrated that systolic blood pressure and heart rate were maintained stable within 70-110% of their preanesthesia values throughout surgery in ASA 1 elderly patients without cardiovascular disease. Thus, the hemodynamically stable time was defined as the time when systolic blood pressure and heart rate were 70-110% of their preanesthesia values. The ratio of hemodynamically stable time to total operative time was used as an index of hemodynamic stability. Results. The median (minimum-maximum) percentage of hemodynamically stable time was longer in Group T (91[50-100]%) than Group G (79[40-91]%, P<0.01). The mean sevoflurane concentration, amount of fentanyl given and frequency of vasopressor use were lower in Group T than Group G (P<0.05). Anesthesia emergence time was shorter in Group T (14[4-30] min) than Group G (18[9-52] min, P<0.01). No worsening of cardiovascular complications was observed. Conclusion. For abdominal surgery in patients with severe cardiovascular disease, combining TAP block with general anesthesia promotes intraoperative hemodynamic stability and early emergence from anesthesia. 2012 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.",English,0

Children who had 2 mg of IM morphine after induction of anesthesia remained drowsy for 1-2 hours but did not have pain for five hours. Children who had either block of the dorsal nerve of penis or application of either lidocaine spray, lidocaine jelly or lidocaine ointment on the wound at the end of surgery woke up with full alertness and were free of pain for 4-5 hours. Topical analgesia were as effective as the nerve block but were devoid of CNS and respiratory depression. It is simple, cheap and reapplicable by the parents. It is the most useful methods for relief of post circumcision pain.",,0

Journal Article,P. Thongrong; P. Jarruwale; P. Panichkul,2011.0,Effectiveness of paracervical block versus intravenous morphine during uterine curettage: a randomized controlled trial,", ","BACKGROUND: Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common gynecologic problem. Fractional curettage, evacuation and curettage, and dilatation curettage are common gynecologic procedures for investigation and treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. To perform all these procedures, anesthesia is needed but technique varies among hospitals. The standard procedure of uterine curettage was performed after paracervical block or intravenous morphine injection. OBJECTIVE: To compare pain scores during and after uterine curettage using intravenous morphine versus paracervical block MATERIAL AND METHOD: A randomized controlled trial study was performed. Sixty-four patients with abnormal uterine bleeding and indication for curettage were enrolled in the present study. Simple randomized procedure was used to distribute the patients into two groups. Intravenous morphine was carried out in 32 patients as the group A while paracervical block was used in the other 32 patients of the group B before uterine curettage. The main outcome measurement was pain score, which assessed by Numerical rating scale ranging from 0-10. RESULTS: The median pain score during uterine curettage were 7.5 and 6 (p = 0.103), immediately after uterine curettage were 3 and 3 (p = 0.822) and 30 minutes after uterine curettage were 1 and 1 (p = 0.206) in the control and treatment group, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pain scores in patients who received paracervical block were not statistically different from those who received intravenous morphine. Paracervical block could be used as another choice for pain relief during uterine curettage.",eng,0

OBJECTIVES: We postulated that the advantage of performing transversus abdominis plane block after caesarean section might be even more obvious after general anaesthesia, resulting in reduced 24-h consumption of morphine. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: In this single centre, randomised double-blind controlled trial, 40 women who underwent caesarean delivery under general anaesthesia were allocated randomly to receive a transversus abdominis plane block or no block. In those who received the block, 20 ml of levobupivacaine 2.5 mg ml was deposited bilaterally into the transversus abdominis plane under ultrasound guidance using a Sonosite Titan (SonoSite, Bothell, Washington, USA) 7-13 MHz linear transducer at the end of surgery when the patient was still anaesthetised. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We recorded patient-controlled intravenous morphine use for 24 h, pain scores at rest and activity, sedation, nausea and vomiting, use of antiemetic medication and overall maternal satisfaction. The primary outcome was 24-h morphine consumption. RESULTS: Patients who received the transversus abdominis plane block used significantly less morphine in 24 h than those in the control group [12.3 (2.6) vs. 31.4 mg (3.1), P<0.001) and had higher satisfaction scores [16 (80%) vs. 5 (25%), P = 0.012). There were no differences between groups in the visual analogue pain scores, sedation level, nausea and vomiting or the use of antiemetic medication. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block reduced morphine consumption following caesarean section under general anaesthesia, with increased maternal satisfaction.",eng,0

The aim of the study is to assess the postoperative analgesic efficacy of TAP block achieved by initially injecting the LA through a catheter placed by ultrasound-guided Seldinger catheter insertion approach (USCIA). Methods Fifty patients scheduled for open inguinal hernia repair were randomized into two groups. Group USCIA: Patients received USCIA-TAP block. Group control: Patients did not receive TAP block. All patients received patient-controlled intravenous morphine postoperatively. The analgesic efficacy of USCIA-TAP block was assessed measuring the total amount of postoperative morphine requirements over the first 48 h postoperatively. Pain scores and level of patient satisfaction with pain relief after surgery were noted. Results The mean cumulative morphine requirement over the first 48 postoperative hours was significantly lower in USCIA group in comparison with the Control group (18.1 + 4.1 vs. 57.9 + 5.3 mg). The success rate of USCIA-TAP block catheter placement was 88%. The pain score of USCIA group was significantly lower at 3, 6, 12, and 24 postoperative hours compared with the Control group. The USCIA group had a significantly higher rate of satisfaction with regard to pain control in comparison with the Control group at the 12th and 24th postoperative hours (9 {8-10} vs. 6 {5-7} and 9 {8-10} vs. 7 {6-8}, respectively).

Children were divided into two groups: group block-block (BB) received a preemptive great auricular nerve block (GAN-block) with 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine before incision followed by a second GAN-block with 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine 1 h before the end of the procedure. Group sham block-block (SB-B) received a preemptive GAN-block with normal saline before surgical incision followed by a GAN-block with 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:200000 epinephrine 1 h before the completion of the procedure. All patients were evaluated for pain with the objective pain score (OPS) by a blinded observer. There was no difference in pain rescue requirements in the postanesthesia care unit (BB versus SB-B, 1 of 20 versus 3 of 20, P= 0.60) or in the short-stay unit (BB versus SB-B, 5 of 20 versus 11 of 20, P = 0.107) or for the entire hospital stay (P = 0.20). There was no significant difference between groups in the time to first rescue pain medication (BB versus SB-B, 226 +/- 71 min versus 201 +/- 94 min). There was no significant difference between groups regarding vomiting in the postoperative period (P = 0.52). We conclude that a preoperative GAN-block does not offer significant advantages for postoperative pain relief in children undergoing tympanomastoid surgery. IMPLICATIONS: This double-blinded randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of preemptive analgesia with a peripheral nerve block of the great auricular nerve for decreasing postoperative pain in children undergoing tympanomastoid surgery. Preemptive analgesia did not improve the quality or duration of postoperative analgesia in our cohort.",English,0

METHOD: Ninety patients were divided into a control group (group C, n = 30), a bilateral superficial cervical plexus group (group S, n = 30) and a bilateral combined superficial and deep cervical plexus block group (group CO, n = 30). Before general anaesthesia, we performed bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (18 ml) and combined superficial (14 ml) and deep (4 ml) cervical plexus block with 0.25% bupivacaine. Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol-remifentanil-N2O-O2. RESULTS: The average concentration of remifentanil was significantly reduced in group S compared with group C and group CO (1.1 +/- 0.3, 1.8 +/- 0.4, 1.8 +/- 0.7 ng ml, respectively; P < 0.05). The incision pain at rest and on swallowing were significantly reduced at 0, 2 and 4 h in group S compared with group C (P < 0.05). Headache showed a tendency to be reduced in group S and group CO, but the posterior neck pain was not different among the three groups. After surgery, the opioid and nonopioid requirement was significantly reduced in group S (P < 0.05). There were fewer side effects and greater patients' satisfaction in group S.

The technique has been refined by ultrasound (US) guidance to deliver the local anaesthetic into the neurofascial plane between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles. We evaluated the analgesic efficacy of US-guided TAP block in patients undergoing caesarean delivery. Methods: Fifty women undergoing caesarean section were randomised to undergo bilateral TAP block with ropivacaine 0.5% (N = 25) versus placebo (N = 25), in addition to standard postoperative analgesia comprising of oral acetaminophen (600 mg) 6 hourly, with IV morphine (3 mg) analgesia for 'breakthrough' pain. Each patient was assessed postoperatively by a blinded investigator for morphine usage, average pain score, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, drowsiness and satisfaction with pain relief. Results: In the TAP group, postoperative morphine requirements up to 24 hours were significantly reduced (median 18.0 mg) compared with the placebo group (median 33 mg). Patients in the TAP group reported lower visual analogue scale scores than patients in the placebo group. Fewer patients required antiemetic in the TAP group. There were no local complications attributable to the TAP block. Conclusion: US-guided bilateral TAP block used in conjunction with oral acetaminophen significantly reduces the need for IV morphine and is an effective component in a multimodal strategy for postoperative analgesia following caesarean delivery.",English,0

Methods: After IRB approval and informed consent and assent, 70 ASA I and II children ages 6-16 years old, scheduled for laparoscopic appendectomies, were prospectively randomized into two groups; (i) Group A, received local infiltration (0.25% bupivacaine) by the surgeon at each port site; (ii) Group B received bilateral US-guided rectus sheath and ilioinguinal nerve blocks. A blinded observer documented pain scores and rescue medications in the PACU and the first 48 hours after surgery. Other side effects of narcotics such as itching, nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness were also recorded. Statistical analysis Method: Descriptive statistics were used to summarize continuous variables by treatment groups. Frequencies and proportions were calculated for categorical variables for each group. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was applied for comparison of categorical variables between the two groups. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test or two-sample t-test were applied for continuous variables depending on if the data distribution was normal or not. The mixed linear model was used to analyze vital measurements over time. Statistical software SAS 9.2 was used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 70 patients were enrolled. Five patients were excluded from the study, four due to incomplete data collection and one for a change in surgical procedure after incision was made. The treatment groups consisted of 46% were girls and 54% were boys. The mean age for the two groups was 10 years (range of 5 to 16 years). The age of subjects between the two groups was not significantly different (p=0.36). The height was not significantly different either (p=0.64) between the two groups. The weight was marginally significant between the two groups (p=0.06). The total frequency of rescue pain medications administered to patients was significantly higher in group A (control) than in group B (p=0.04). There were no differences for adverse outcomes between the two treatment groups. Conclusions: Rectus sheath blocks have been shown to be effective in controlling pain during and after umbilical hernia repairs, as have ilioinguinal nerve blocks for groin surgery in pediatric patients.(1) The combination of these blocks was performed on patients in the peripheral nerve block group (group B) with US-assistance to provide analgesia to the dermatomal regions involved with port sites in laparoscopic appendectomies. This study validates the use of US-guided rectus sheath blocks and ilioinguinal nerve blocks in children undergoing laparoscopic appendectomies when compared to standard infiltration analgesia. We hope that this study will encourage anesthesiologists to perform these blocks in children undergoing laparoscopic appendectomies.",English,0

MorbidIiy and post operative pain is less in PCNL than open surgery but is still significant. The pain is much more in patients undergoing supracostal punctures required for upper calyceal calculi and in patients requiring multiple tract for stone clearance. PCNL through supracostal tract irritate and inflamed the periostium of the ribs thus aggravating the pain. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of intercostals nerve block in alleviating immediate postoperative pain after supracostal puncture for PCNL. Material and Methods: As a pilot study a prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in 30 patients to assess the impact of intercostals nerve block in two segments and two segment above the site of puncture, using 2ml of 0.5% bupivacaine after supracostal pucture for PCNL. Patients were randomized to receive 2mL of 0.5% bupivacaine in intercostal block group (n = 15) or no infiltration in control group (n = 15) at the conclusion of the procedure. Postoperative pain score and analgesic requirement for the first 24 hours were assessed by visual analog scales. Rescue analgesia with injection Tramadol 50mg was given when pain score exceeded 4. Results: The pain score and analgesic requirement in intercostal block group was significantly lower than control group (p < 0.05). All 15 patients in the intercostal block group had no morbidity related to intercostals nerve block. All patients had a stable hemodynamics and respiratory comfort. Conclusions: In this preliminary pilot study intercostals nerve block significantly reduces postoperative pain and analgesic requirement after supracostal puncture in PCNL.

Patients scheduled for elective LC were randomized to receive either standard care or to undergo an OSTAP or TAP block. All blocks were performed with ultrasound guidance, and 20 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine was injected bilaterally. The postoperative pain score and consumption of rescue analgesics were evaluated. Results. The OSTAP block reduced postoperative verbal numerical rating scale pain scores (median [Interquartile range, IQR]) compared to standard care at 10 min (2 [1-4] vs. 7 [5-8]), 30 min (2 [1-5] vs. 6 [5-8]), 1 h (2 [1-3] vs. 5 [4-6]), and 3 h (2 [2-3] vs. 4 [3-5]). Pain scores were also lower in the OSTAP group than in the TAP group at 10 min (2 [1-4] vs. 4 [2-6]), 1 h (2 [1-3] vs. 3 [3-4]), 3 h (2 [2-3] vs. 3 [3-4]), 6 h (2 [2-3] vs. 3 [3-5]), and 24 h (1 [1-2] vs. 2 [2-3]) postoperatively. The total fentanyl requirement was reduced in the OSTAP group (p = 0.005). Conclusion. The OSTAP block can provide better analgesia than the TAP block or standard care during the post-operative 24 h period in patients undergoing LC. (Minerva Anestesiol 2014;80:185-93).",English,0

However, the port sites of LC are above the umbilicus (T10). This study was designed to evaluate the effect of oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane (OSTAP) block for analgesia in patients undergoing LC. Methods: Thirty patients undergoing LC were randomized to receive standard care, comprising fentanyl, pethidine, nalbuphine and ketorolac, as required, or to undergo OSTAP block ,and TAP block with standard care. All blocks were performed with ultrasound guidance and injected 20 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine bilaterally. The postoperative verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was assessed at 10, 30 min, and 1, 3, 6 and 24 hrs. Postoperative demands of rescue analgesics were recorded. The extent of sensory block was also evaluated using cold alcohol swab. Results: The OSTAP block reduced VNRS compared to standard care at 10, 30 min and 1 hr after the operation. The postoperative VNRS also were lower in the OSTAP block group than the group receiving the TAP block at 10 min and 1 hr. Total fentanyl requirements in the first postoperative 1 hour were reduced in the OSTAP, TAP block groups. The OSTAP block commonly produced a sensory block of T7~10, whereas the TAP block produced a block of T1I12 dermatomes. Conclusions: The OSTAP block can provide better analgesia than the TAP block at early postoperative period in patients undergoing LC.",English,0

Caudal block remains the gold standard for regional blocks used for postoperative analgesia for abdominal surgery in pediatric patients. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a new peripheral nerve block that has been demonstrated to provide effective postoperative analgesia in adults, that is characterized by decreased postoperative pain scores and opioid requirements. This prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was designed to evaluate the intra- and postoperative analgesic efficacy of TAP block in pediatric patients. In the same study we compare the efficacy of ultrasound-guided TAP block versus caudal analgesia for lower and middle abdominal surgery in pediatric population as a part of a concept for balanced analgesia. Patients and Methods: 90 ASA I, II, and III (cancer patients). patients aged 2 -8 years were enrolled in the study. They were assigned to one of three groups Group 1 (n = 30) received standard general anesthesia (GA), Group 2 (n = 30) received standard GA and caudal block with 1 ml/kg of 0.5% bupivacaine, and Group 3 (n = 30) received standard GA and TAP block. The following parameters were recorded : Intra-operatively, HR, MAP, Post-operative pain was assessed by FLACC Scale. Incidence of agitation was also assessed. Postoperative pain scores, the time to the first administration of opioid analgesic agents, and opioid use during the initial 24 postoperative hours were also assessed. Results: Group I patients showed higher intra-operative fentanyle consumption. Caudal block group, showed comparable consumption of intra-operative fentanyle to TAP block group; The time to first analgesic requirement was prolonged in TAP block group, with statistical significant difference in comparison to other two groups. Group I demonstrated higher FLACC scores at all time intervals durin 24 postoperative hours. Conclusions: TAP provide superior analgesic efficacy and a significant decrease of systemic analgesics demand that was comparable to caudal epidural analgesia , with the added advantage of for prolonged postoperative analgesia.",English,0

TAP block is a new regional anesthetic technique, it has been implemented successfully for pain control after laparoscopic surgery in non obese patients. Success with this block is dependent on correct identification of the neuro-fascial plane. The introduction of ultrasound guidance has allowed greater precision of needle placement in the desired tissue plane. This prospective, randomized, double blinded, controlled study was carried out to evaluate the feasibility, and efficacy of ultrasound-guided TAP block in patients with morbid obesity undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery. We hypothesed that; USG-TAP block is feasible, and effective in reducing pain scores, and attenuating morphine consumption. PATIENTS&METHODS: After obtaining approval from Ethics Committee. 100 patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy enrolled in the study. Patients with, body mass index > 35 kg/m2, included.patients were allocated by sealed envelops to one of two groups; USG-TAP(50), or to receive standard care regarding regular postoperative analgesia (50), according to the anesthesia department protocol. before extubation; the skin was prepared, the probe was placed on the anterolateral abdominal wall between the iliac crest and the subcostal margin. A 22-gauge needle was inserted medial to the probe by the in-plane technique. When the tip of the needle reached the TAP plane, 1 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine were injected into the patients of the TAP block group. after negative aspiration, and the spread of the drugs was confirmed. Then, the remaining 19 mL was injected. these step done bilaterally. The primary endpoints of the study were the amount of morphine required in the first 24 hours. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: For sample size calculation, we considered that a clinically important difference in 48 h morphine consumption would be a 25% absolute reduction in the TAP compared with control group. Based on this assumption 35 patients were required for the IV-PCA+TAP block group, and 40 patients were assigned to the IV-PCAgroup. To minimize any effect of data loss, we elected to recruit 50 patients in each group. Comparisons of means were conducted with the Student's t test for parametric variables and Mann-Whitney for non-parametric ones. RESULTS: median NRS pain score of (USG-TAP) group was consistently lower at 30 minutes, hourly till 6,6,12, and 18 h at rest and on movement, and coughing in the postoperative period. This reduction in NRS showed statistically significant difference in comparison to control group Cumulative morphine consumption was significantly reduced at 24h, and 48h in patients who received a TAP block. conclusion: ultrasound-guided TAP block is a feasible technique for effective component of multimodal postoperative analgesia in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.",English,0

Shrivastava,2013.0,Evaluation of postoperative analgesic efficacy of transversus abdominis plane block after abdominal surgery: A comparative study,10.4103/0976-9668.107286,"BACKGROUND: The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is an effective method of providing postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing midline abdominal wall incisions, by blocking the abdominal wall neural afferents via the bilateral lumbar triangles of Petit. We evaluated its analgesic efficacy in patients during the first 48 postoperative hours after abdominal surgery, in a randomized, controlled single-blind clinical trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients (mean age 36.2 +/- 9.6 years) of either sex of ASA grade 1 and 2 who underwent major gynecological or surgical operation were randomized either to receive standard care, including patient-controlled tramadol analgesia (n = 30), or to undergo TAP block (n = 30) in addition to standard care. After completion of surgery, 20 ml of 0.375% levobupivacaine was deposited into the transversus abdominis neurofascial plane via the bilateral lumbar triangles of Petit. Each patient was assessed in the postanesthesia care unit and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h postoperatively. RESULTS: The TAP block reduced Visual Analog Scale pain scores at most (2, 4, 6, 12, 24 h), but not at all time (36, 48 h) points assessed. Patients undergoing TAP block had reduced tramadol requirement in 24 h (210.05 +/- 20.5 vs. 320.05 +/- 10.6; P < 0.01) and 48 h (508.25 +/- 20.6 vs. 550.25 +/- 20.6; P < 0.01), and a longer time to the first PCA tramadol request (in minutes), compared to the control group (178.5 +/- 45.6 vs. 23.5 +/- 3.8; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The TAP block provided highly effective postoperative analgesia in the first 24 postoperative hours after major abdominal surgery, and no complications due to the TAP block were detected.",eng,1

The objective of this study was to assess the analgesic benefit of FIB after THA. Our primary hypothesis was administration of FIB decreases the intensity of postoperative pain (numeric rating scale [NRS-11] score) compared with sham block (SB) in patients after THA. METHODS: After institutional review board approval and informed consent, 32 eligible patients having THA were recruited. In the postoperative care unit, although all patients received intravenous morphine sulfate patient-controlled analgesia, patients reporting pain of 3 or greater on the NRS-11 scale were randomized to receive ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca (30 mL 0.5% ropivacaine) or SB (30 mL 0.9% NaCl) using identical technique, below fascia iliaca. The primary outcome was pain intensity (NRS-11) after FIB. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (16 in each group) completed the study; all patients received an FIB. There was no difference in pain intensity (NRS-11 = 5.0 +/- 0.6 vs 4.7 +/- 0.6, respectively) after FIB versus SB or in opioid consumption (8.97 +/- 1.6 vs 5.7 +/- 1.6 mg morphine, respectively) between the groups at 1 hour. The morphine consumption after 24 hours was similar in both groups (49.0 +/- 29.9 vs 50.4 +/- 34.5 mg, P = 0.88, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence in these data suggests that the difference in average pain intensity after FIB versus SB was not significant (95% confidence interval, -2.2-1.4 NRS units).",eng,0

Methods : This prospective, double blind study enrolled ninety two donors undergoing elective LDN. They were randomized before induction of anesthesia to receive thoracic para-vertebral block with 0.75% ropivacaine and port site infiltration with normal saline (Group A) or thoracic para-vertebral block with normal saline and port site infiltration with ropivacaine at the completion of surgery (Group B). Both the groups also received Acetazolamide 5mg/kg diluted in 10ml normal saline through the Ryle's tube soon after the induction of anaesthesia followed by flushing with 10 ml of normal saline and another 500ml normal saline was used for intraperitoneal irrigation. Primary end points of the study was be to assess the intensity of post operative pain on a visual analogue scale, latency of rescue analgesic request rate and total analgesic requirement. Secondary end point was complications related to study drugs. Results : Pain scores assessed for 72 hrs postoperatively were significantly less in patients who received paravertebral block with 0.75% ropivacaine (Group A; P < 0.05).The time from extubation to the administration of first dose of tramadol was significantly longer in Group A (100.56+45.43 mins) versus Group B (25.36 + 18.16min). Statistically significant difference was observed in the frequency at which rescue analgesics were administered in Group B (3.93+0.69) compared to Group A (2.18+0.65). Thus, cumulative rescue analgesics requirement was significantly reduced in Group A compared to Group B ie 110.81+33.614 &197.56+33.450 respectively. Better hemodynamic stability and higher patient satisfaction scores were observed in Group A with reduced incidence of PONV. No adverse effects related to study drugs or PVB analgesia were noticed. Discussion : Thoracic paravertebral block provided adequate post operative pain relief and better patient satisfaction after laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. Thus, a multimodal analgesic approach is recommended for significant reduction in postoperative pain after LDN.

While most patients in the CISB and SISB groups were fast-tracked to PACU discharge, no patient in the GA group was fast-tracked (Chi P = 0.003). Length of stay in the PACU was significantly shorter for the CISB and SISB groups than for the GA group (20 +/- 31, 30 +/- 42, and 165 +/- 118 minutes, respectively (CISB vs GA, P < 0.001; SISB vs GA, P <0.001), and time-to-discharge home was significantly shorter when compared with the GA group. Time to first pain report was longer in the CISB group. Mean NRS scores were lower for patients in the CISB group than in the SISB and GA groups on postoperative days 1 and 2, and use of narcotics (doses >/=1) was lower until postoperative day 3. Patients who received CISB slept significantly longer than patients who received SISB or GA (P < 0.01) during the first 48 hours postoperatively. By the end of the study week, 26% of patients in the CISB group, 83% in the SISB group, and 58% of GA patients reported NRS >/=4 (both P-values </= 0.05). CONCLUSION: The analgesic benefits of CISB found in the PACU and immediately after discharge extend through the intermediate recovery period ending on postoperative day 7.",eng,0

OBJECTIVE(S): The present study was designed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided TAP block with high volume local anaesthetic (0.5 ml kg) during the first 24 h after surgery in children undergoing inguinal hernia repair. DESIGN: Randomised comparative study. SETTING: Gaziantep University Hospital between December 2010 and May 2011. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-seven children between 2 and 8 years of age undergoing unilateral inguinal hernia repair were randomised to TAP block (group T, n = 29) or to wound infiltration (group C, n = 28). INTERVENTION(S): A TAP block using ultrasound guidance with 0.25% levobupivacaine 0.5 ml kg(-1) or wound infiltration with 0.2 ml kg(-1) 0.25% levobupivacaine, was performed on the same side as the hernia under general anaesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to first analgesic, cumulative number of doses of analgesic, pain scores and adverse effects were assessed over the course of 24 h. RESULTS: The time to first analgesic (mean +/- SD) was significantly longer in group T than in group C (17 +/- 6.8 vs. 4.7 +/- 1.6 h, respectively; P < 0.001). Thirteen (45%) patients in group T did not require any analgesic within the first 24 h. The cumulative number of doses of analgesic was significantly lower in group T than in group C (1.3 +/- 1.2 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.7, respectively, P < 0.001). Pain scores were significantly different between the groups at all time points except at 1, 20 and 24 h (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided TAP block with high volume (0.5 ml kg) 0.25% levobupivacaine provides prolonged postoperative analgesia and reduced analgesic use without any clinical side-effects after unilateral hernia repair in children.

METHODS: Eighty-one patients, ASA physical status I-III, undergoing elective cataract surgery under monitored anesthesia care, aged between 43 and 78 years, were randomly assigned to three groups: retrobulbar block (group R), sub-Tenon block (group S), or topical anesthesia (group T). Three minutes after the start of monitored anesthesia care with lidocaine-propofol-remifentanil mixture, an ophthalmologist performed regional anesthesia. Intraoperative hemodynamics, pain score, and patients' satisfaction with the anesthetic experiences were recorded by a study-blinded anesthesiologist. RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure and heart rate in group R were significantly higher than those in groups S and T during and just after the regional block (p<0.05). Group R required smaller dosage of patient controlled sedation and fewer supplemental bolus doses than groups S and T (p<0.05). On the other hand, group S showed the highest satisfaction scores among the three groups (p<0.05).

The effects of scalp blockade with levobupivacaine after craniotomy for aneurysmal clipping have not been investigated. Methods: 10 ASA I or II patients, scheduled for elective craniotomies for aneurysmal clipping, were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, placebocontrolled study. Scalp block was performed by blocking the supraorbital, supratrochlear, and auriculotemporal nerves using 12 ml 0.75% levobupivacaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine (group B, n = 5) or 0.9 % normal saline (group S, n = 5). PCA consisted of opioid (fentanyl) and connected to patients. Postoperative headache (VAS), PCA consumption, hemodynamic variables (Heart rate [HR] and mean arterial pressure [MAP]) and the incidence of PONVand respiratory depression were recorded at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr after alert consciousness (Glasgow coma scale 914). Results: Statistically significant differences in postoperative pain (P = 0.001) and PCA consumption (P = 0.00) over time between the two groups were observed. Postoperative pain scores and PCA consumption were lower in group B than group S at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after alert consciousness (P G 0.05). In addition, anti-hypertensive agent was less required in group B than in group S (4 for group S vs. 1 for group B) through the difference did not reach statistical significance. There were no complications related to the technique of block or drugs in any of the 10 patients. Conclusions: This study demonstrated than scalp blocks with levobupivacaine effectively relieved postoperative headache and spared postoperative PCA consumption without adverse events.

We compared efficacy of prolonged transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with systemic administration of opioids within postoperative period. Materials and Methods: 45 women underwent abdominal hysterectomy have been evaluated. All patients were randomized into two groups. In the study group (n = 23), prolonged TAP block was used. The control group (n = 22) received standard treatment with IV administration of morphine and dexketoprofen. TAP block was performed using epidural set. Each patient was evaluated following extubation and also 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hour after surgery. Results and Discussion: In this study, the primary evaluation criterion was 24-hours consumption of morphine. Another results included: time to onset of the need in morphine and VAS score. In the patients of the main group, decrease of 24-hours morphine consumption, that was 20.4 95% CI (18.0, 22.8) mg vs. 38.2 95 % CI (35.6, 40.8) mg, (p< 0.01) in the control group, respectively, has been observed. In the TAP block group, the first administration of morphine was required after median (IQR) 4.8 (3.8-5.6) hours vs. 0.25 (0.2-0.3) hours (p=0.05) in the control group, respectively. In baseline evaluation of the postoperative pain intensity in rest and in motion using VAS, reliable intergroup differences were detected. In the study stages, i.e. after extubation and at 2, 4, and 6 hours of the postoperative period, the pain intensity in the TAP block group was lower than in the control one and according to evaluation using VAS in the rest, it was: in the main group - mean (sd) 14.7(9.5), 18.3 (7.8), 15.6(8.4), 18.3 (10.3), and in the control group - 54.5 (15), 50(9.2), 43.6 (20.1), 40.1(22.4) (p< 0.01) respectively. No differences in the VAS score in the rest at 12 and 24 hours after surgery between the groups were statistically significant. When patients moved, significant increase of the VAS score in the control group, while in the TAP block group, the VAS score in the motion had no significant changes. Conclusion(s): Use of prolonged TAP block within postoperative period following abdominal hysterectomy reliably increases efficacy of postoperative analgesia, improves patients' comfort, and decreases the need in opiates.",English,0

Methods: Forty female patients, ASA I or II, undergoing subpectoral bilateral breast augmentation prospectively entered this randomised single-blind study. The sample size was based on a study power of 80% and alpha value of 0.05 (1-tailed), with the ability to detect a 'large' effect. Patients were randomised to one of two groups; PVB with local anaesthesia or local anaesthesia alone. Both groups were sedated with propofol, titrated to effect. Demographic data, intraoperative co-operation scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting, analgesia use and visual analogue scale pain scores were recorded. All patients completed a preoperative anxiety and quality of recovery questionnaire: pain scores and analgesia requirements were recorded at home. Outcome measures were: 1) intraoperative patient co-operation, 2) propofol requirement, 3) postoperative pain, 4) quality of recovery and 5) complications. Results: PVB improved intraoperative cooperation (P <0.001), reduced propofol requirement (P=0.035), decreased post-operative pain at home (P=0.003) and improved quality of recovery (P=0.050). Protocol breach occurred with two patients in the local anaesthesia group for uncontrolled pain. Escape analgesia was required in 30% of patients in the local anaesthesia group. Higher levels of anxiety and pain were indicative of poorer intraoperative co-operation and reduced quality of recovery. There were no significant complications. Conclusions: In this study PVB was superior to local anaesthesia for day case bilateral breast surgery. A more objective indicator of sedation depth might have been advantageous.",English,0

Methods. Prospective randomized comparative blind study, without placebo control. Patient satisfaction evaluated by the Iowa Satisfaction with Anesthesia Scale (ISAS). Results. The authors prospectively enrolled 59 patients (61% female) in the study, who were randomized into groups: 26 in the TA group and 33 in the STB. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of age, sex, waiting time for surgery, ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) state, eye laterality, cataract density, pupillary dilation, or surgery duration, but patient collaboration was better in the STB group. We found a mean 2.2 mmHg post-anesthetic rise in intraocular pressure in the STB group, with normalization at 24 hours, and no rise in the TA group. Subconjunctival hemorrhage and chemosis were more prevalent in the STB group, and the improvement of visual acuity was similar in both groups. Subjective satisfaction with the anesthetic technique, both for the surgeon and for the patient, was more elevated in the STB group. The final ISAS scores were 1.87 in the TA group and 2.71 in the STB (p<0.005). Conclusions.

Caudal epidural block associated with general anesthesia is the anesthetic technique used more often in children, but it is limited by the short duration of the postoperative analgesia. Peripheral nerve blocks are associated with a low incidence of complications and prolonged analgesia. The objective of this study was to compare the duration of analgesia in peripheral nerve blocks and caudal block, as well as morphine consumption in the first 24 hours after correction of CCF in children. METHODS: This is a randomized, double-blind study with children undergoing surgeries for posteromedial release of CCF, who were divided in four groups according to the anesthetic technique: caudal (ACa), sciatic and femoral block (IF), sciatic and saphenous block (IS), and sciatic block and local anesthesia (IL), associated with general anesthesia. In the first 24 hours, patients received oral dypirone and acetaminophen, and they were evaluated by anesthesiologists who were unaware of the technique used. Oral morphine (0.19 mg x kg(1) per day) was administered according to the scores of the CHIPPS (Children's and infants' postoperative pain scale) scale. RESULTS: One hundred and eighteen children separated into four groups: ACa (30), IF (32), IS (28), and IL (28) participated in this study. The mean time between the blockade and the first dose of morphine was 6.16 hours in group ACa, 7.05 hours in group IF, 7.58 in IS, and 8.18 hours in IL. Morphine consumption was 0.3 mg.kg-1 per day in all four groups. Significant differences were not observed among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: peripheral nerve blocks did not promote longer lasting analgesia or a decrease in morphine consumption in the first 24 hours in children undergoing CCF correction when compared to caudal epidural block.","eng

Several studies have examined the effect of TAP block on postoperative pain outcomes after laparoscopic surgical procedures and generated conflicting results. Our main objective in the current investigation was to evaluate the effect of TAP block on postoperative analgesia outcomes for laparoscopic surgical procedures. METHODS: A search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of the TAP block compared with an inactive group (placebo or no treatment"") on postoperative pain outcomes in laparoscopic surgical procedures. Primary outcomes included early (0-4 hours) and late (24 hours) postoperative pain at rest and on movement and postoperative opioid consumption (up to 24 hours). Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Publication bias was evaluated by examining the presence of asymmetric funnel plots using Egger regression test. Meta-regression analysis was performed to establish an association between the local anesthetic dose and the evaluated outcomes. RESULTS: Ten randomized clinical trials with 633 subjects were included in the analysis. The weighted mean difference (99% confidence interval) of the combined effects favored TAP block over control for pain at rest (<4 hours, -2.41 [-3.6 to -1.16]) and (at 24 hours, -1.33 [-2.19 to -0.48]) (0-10 numerical scale). Postoperative opioid consumption was decreased in the TAP block group compared with control, weighted mean difference (99% confidence interval) of -5.74 (-8.48 to -2.99) mg morphine IV equivalents. Publication bias was not present in any of the analyses. Preoperative TAP block administration resulted in greater effects on early pain and opioid consumption compared with postoperative administration. Meta-regression analysis revealed an association between local anesthetic dose and the TAP block effect on late pain at rest and postoperative opioid consumption. None of the studies reported symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: TAP block is an effective strategy to improve early and late pain at rest and to reduce opioid consumption after laparoscopic surgical procedures. In contrast, the TAP block was not superior compared with control to reduce early and late pain during movement. Preoperative administration of a TAP block seems to result in greater effects on postoperative pain outcomes. We also detected a local anesthetic dose response on late pain and postoperative opioid consumption(Figure Presented).""",English,0

Methods: Twenty-seven consecutive patients ASA I-IV undergoing major general or urological surgery received postoperative analgesia via continuous wound infiltration with local anaesthetic solution. Patients were randomly allocated in 3 groups according to the administered solution which in group I (n=7) consisted of 270 ml ropivacaine 0,45% , in group II (n=13) of 270 ml ropivacaine 0,45% + 0,5mg fentanyl and in group III (n=7) of 270 ml ropi-vacaine 0,45% + 300mg diclofenac. Two type-soaker catheters were placed subcutaneously at the end of the surgery and left in place for 72h while the rate of infusion was 5-8 ml/h. Pain control at rest and in movement was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) immediately after the procedure and 3,6,12,24,36,48,72 h later. Incidence of PONV,CNS depres-sion,hypotension and demand forsupplementary administration ofanalgesics were recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction was used in order to compare pain scores. Results: Patients' mean age, ASA status,duration of surgery and anaesthesia were similar between the three groups. Significantly lower level of pain was found in group II compared to group I at rest in 24h (p=0,042) and 36h (p=0,015) and in movement in 36h (p=0,048).Patients of group II presented less pain compared to those of group III in 36h and 48h at rest and in movement (p< 0,05) while there was need foradditional analgesics in 71% of the patients of group III.

Mazer,2013.0,Scalp nerve blocks for postoperative supra-tentorial craniotomy analgesia,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ANA.0b013e3182a4d5ff,"Background: Clinical studies suggest that analgesia after craniotomy is variable and suboptimal and there may be significant benefits from the addition of regional anesthesia by scalp nerve blocks (SNB). This approach may optimize postoperative analgesia and neurological recovery while minimizing opioid side effects. Current trials assessing the role of regional anesthesia after craniotomy are generally underpowered and do not provide definitive assessment of the efficacy of SNB on pain. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of SNB on pain after supratentorial craniotomy in a prospective, double blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Methods: After obtaining REB approval and informed consent, 89 patients were randomized to receive postoperative bilateral SNB injections with either 20mL 0.5% bupivacaine (treatment group-TG) or 20mL normal saline (placebo group-PG). The primary outcome was the 24- hour visual analogue scale (VAS) score. Secondary outcomes included 24 and 48 hours nausea and vomiting incidence, PCA hydromorphone use and pain scores at day 5, 30, and 60. Assuming a 2-sided a=0.05 and b=0.1, we estimated we needed 38 patients per group to detect a 2.25-point difference in VAS score, given an estimate VAS of 4.5 in the control group with a SD of 3. We recruited 89 subjects to accommodate potential dropouts. Outcomes were evaluated using 2 sample t test, Wilcoxon or area-under-the-curve test, as needed. P<0.05 was considered significant. Results: Patient characteristics were not different between groups. The primary outcome (VAS at 24 h) was not significantly different (23.0+19.2 mm, PG vs. 31.2+21.4 mm, TG) (P=0.068). Similarly, the 24-hour PCA hydromorphone use was not significantly different (P=0.23) between PG (3.2+2.7 mg) and TG (4.0+3.5 mg). However, an early effect of SNB on VAS score was demonstrated as significant interaction between treatment and time (Figure, linear mixed-effect model). The area-under-the-curve analysis of the pooled 48 hours VAS scores, the 24- and 48-hour nausea and the 24-hour vomiting incidence were not different between groups. Pain at day 5, 30, and 60 was not significantly different (P=0.96, 0.46, and 0.49, respectively). Discussion: This is the first properly powered RCT on the effect of postoperative SNB on pain and opioid consumption. No difference was observed for the primary outcome. However, an early treatment effect of SNB on VAS score was observed, suggesting that the scalp block was effective at reducing some degree of somatic pain. The large SD in the VAS data indicate the high variability in pain response. This variability, and the lack of a sustained analgesic effect of SNB, suggest that additional mechanisms were responsible for postcraniotomy pain, including viscerally mediated pain. Additional therapeutic approaches to limit (Figure Presented) centrally mediated pain may facilitate optimal management of postcraniotomy pain.",English,0

A meta-analysis,10.1213/01.ane.0000181289.09675.7d,"Although most randomized clinical trials conclude that the addition of continuous peripheral nerve blockade (CPNB) decreases postoperative pain and opioid-related side effects when compared with opioids, studies have included relatively small numbers of patients and the majority failed to show statistical significance during all time periods for reduced pain or side effects. We identified studies primarily by searching Ovid Medline (1966-May 21, 2004) for terms related to postoperative analgesia with CPNB and opioids. Each article from the final search was reviewed and data were extracted from tables, text, or extrapolated from figures as needed. Nineteen articles, enrolling 603 patients, met all inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were a clearly defined anesthetic technique (combined general/regional anesthesia, general anesthesia alone, peripheral nerve block), randomized trial, adult patient population (> or =18 yr old), CPNB (or analgesia) used postoperatively (intrapleural catheters were deemed not to be classified as a peripheral nerve catheter), and opioids administered for postoperative analgesia in groups not receiving peripheral nerve block. Perineural analgesia provided better postoperative analgesia compared with opioids (P < 0.001). This effect was seen for all time periods measured for both mean visual analog scale and maximum visual analog scale at 24 h (P < 0.001), 48 h (P < 0.001), and 72 h (mean visual analog scale only) (P < 0.001) postoperatively. Perineural catheters provided superior analgesia to opioids for all catheter locations and time periods (P < 0.05). Nausea/vomiting, sedation, and pruritus all occurred more commonly with opioid analgesia (P < 0.001). A reduction in opioid use was noted with perineural analgesia (P < 0.001). CPNB analgesia, regardless of catheter location, provided superior postoperative analgesia and fewer opioid-related side effects when compared with opioid analgesia.",eng,1

Methods: A total of 67 children age 2-12 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 1 and 2, were randomized to receive either sub-Tenon block (ST) in the operative eye or 2 mcg/kg of intravenous fentanyl (F) for squint surgery after induction of general anesthesia in this double-blind study. Postoperative pain was measured by either modified Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) or Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Pain in the postoperative period (up to 2 hours) was measured as the primary endpoint. Other parameters measured in the groups were intraoperative hemodynamics, postoperative modified CHEOPS or VAS at shifting, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery, incidence of intraoperative OCR, and PONV at shifting, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. Results: There was no statistical difference in the postoperative pain scores in the recovery room up to 2 hours after surgery. The VAS and CHEOPS scores were not different in the groups up to 24 hours after surgery. The incidence of OCR was significantly higher in group F than group ST. The incidence of PONV was significantly higher in group F than group ST at 30 minutes and 1 hour after the surgery (41%, 47% vs 19%, 9%, respectively, p<0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference in intraoperative hemodynamics and PONV scores after 2 hours in the postanesthesia care unit. Conclusions: Use of sub-Tenon block does not decrease the incidence of postoperative pain significantly in children undergoing squint surgery. However, it leads to a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of intraoperative OCR and PONV in the early recovery period in these patients. 2014 Wichtig Publishing.",English,0

METHODS: Thirty American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II children with pectus excavatum, scheduled for the Nuss procedure, were enrolled at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The patients were randomly allocated into the BTPV block group or the control group. In the BTPV group, 0.25% ropivacaine 0.5 mL/kg with 1:200,000 epinephrine was injected under ultrasound guidance on each side at the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra. Postoperative pain was evaluated in both groups for the first 48 hours. Total opioid administered and cumulative attempts on the patient/parent-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA) pump were recorded. Postoperative negative behavioral changes in the children were evaluated on postoperative days 1, 7, and 30, respectively, using the posthospital behavior questionnaire. RESULTS: The pain scores were significantly reduced in the postanesthesia care unit and for the first 48 hours postoperatively in the BTPV group compared to the control group (P < 0.01). The sufentanil use in the postanesthesia care unit was significantly greater in the control group [mean (SD), 0.2 (0) mcg/kg] compared to the BTPV group [mean (SD), 0.05 (0.06) mcg/kg] (P < 0.01). The postoperative sufentanil use was significantly higher in the control group during the first 24 hours (P < 0.01).

http://ovidsp.ovid.com/athens?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=2013245491","Background: Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical operations in children. It has complications such as pain, hemorrhage, laryngospasm, postoperative nausea, and vomiting. Posttonsillectomy pain management is vital in reducing the suffering and restlessness of children. Several methods have been suggested to preventing and treat post-tonsillectomy pain. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of preoperative peritonsillar injection of lidocaine and placebo on postoperative pain relief. Methods: This randomized, triple-blind clinical trial was conducted on sixty 3-12-year-old children who were candidate for tonsillectomy in Imam Khomeini Hospital (Ardabil, Iran). Children were randomly assigned to the lidocaine or placebo group. Anesthesia was induced similarly for all patients. Peritonsillar injections of 1 mg/kg lidocaine (per 2 ml volume) and 2 ml normal saline were performed for the lidocaine and placebo groups, respectively. Patients' vital signs were recorded in before the induction of anesthesia, during the operation, and in the recovery room. Pain was assessed by using the self-report Oucher Scale and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale. Sedation state was also assessed through the Wilson Sedation Scale. Side effects such as nausea and vomiting, rebleeding after surgery, dyspnea, apnea, and laryngospasm were studied and recorded in the recovery room and 24 hours after the surgery. Data was analyzed with chi-square test, Student's t-test, and repeated measures analysis of variance. Findings: Based on the Oucher Scale, the mean pain score in the lidocaine group was lower than the placebo group at the 5<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, 30<sup>th</sup>, 60<sup>th</sup>, 120<sup>th</sup> and 240<sup>th</sup> minutes after the surgery. However, the difference was only statistically significant at the 240<sup>th</sup> postoperative minute (P = 0.03). The average sedation score in the placebo group was higher than the lidocaine group at the 15<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> minutes after the surgery (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of rebleeding, need for oxygen, dyspnea, apnea, period of recovery room stay, and the need for painkillers in morning after the surgery. Conclusion: Preoperative peritonsillar injection of lidocaine was effective in reducing postoperative pain in children. Moreover, it did not result in any critical side effects during recovery and the first 24 hours after surgery. Thus, we certainly can use lidocaine for reducing postoperative pain in children.",English,0

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomised and double-blind study was to evaluate the analgesic effect of a TAP block in patients scheduled for primary inguinal hernia repair. The TAP block was evaluated versus placebo and versus an active comparator (ilioinguinal block and wound infiltration). DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Single centre trial. Study period from June 2010 to November 2011. PATIENTS: Adults (18 to 75 years) with American Society of Anesthesiologists' status 1-3 scheduled for primary inguinal hernia repair as day case surgery were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Ninety patients were allocated to one of three groups: group TAP, group infiltration (ilioinguinal nerve block and wound infiltration) and group placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was pain scores while coughing between group TAP and group placebo calculated as area under the curve for the first 24 h (AUC24 h). Secondary outcomes were pain scores while coughing and at rest, opioid consumption and side effects in groups TAP, infiltration and placebo. RESULTS: Visual analogue pain scores while coughing and at rest demonstrated no difference between groups. Pain scores in groups infiltration, TAP and placebo were 19 versus 22 versus 15 mm at rest (P = 1.00) and 37 versus 41 versus 37 mm while coughing (P = 1.00). Pain scores at 6 h (AUC6 h) were significantly lower in group infiltration than in group TAP (10 versus 25 mm at rest, P < 0.001; 17 versus 40 mm while coughing, P < 0.001), and than in group placebo (10 versus 20 mm at rest, P = 0.003; 17 versus 38 mm while coughing, P < 0.001). Median morphine consumption was lower in group infiltration than in group placebo (0 versus 5 mg, P < 0.003). No differences among groups were demonstrated for ketobemidone consumption or side effects. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided TAP block did not reduce postoperative pain after inguinal hernia repair.

After approval of the Medical Faculty Ethics Commitee and patient consent, aged 20-70 years, American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status I-II, 100 patients who were undergoing laminectomy, were included. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: 0.1 mg/kg intravenous boluse mophine was given to patients in the first group 20 minutes before the end of operation and intravenous PCA morphine (40 mg morphine in 100 mL isotonic saline, PCA demand dose 0.02 mg kg, 20 min lockout time) was given after the operation. The patients in the second group were placed prone position after intubation, bilateral paravertebral somatic block was performed with 5 mL levobupivacaine 0,5% for each nerve to upper dermatome of laminectomy level. Intravenous PCA morphine was started after the end of operation. All patients were recieved 8 mg ondansetron for antiemesis. Postoperative systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation values, pain [Visual Analog Scale (VAS)] scores, total morphine consumption and side effects were recorded. Demographic data, operation times and hemodynamic parameters of groups were similar. VAS scores were higher in group 1 than group 2 on postoperative 4, 6, and 12 hours (P<0.05). Total morphine consumption was recorded as 29.46+9.34 mg in group 1 and 2 and 88+7.28 mg in group 2 for 24 hours. Total morphine consumption was significantly lower in group 2 than group 1 (P<0.05). We conclude that the application of preemptive lumbar paravertebral somatic block with levobupivacaine reduce morphine requirement, provides more efficient analgesia, without change in hemodynamic parameters or side effects. 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",English,0

Our hypothesis was that bilateral TAP blocks decrease pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy when compared with local anesthetic infiltration of trocar insertion sites. METHODS: Eighty patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to receive either bilateral TAP blocks or local anesthetic infiltration of trocar insertion sites with ropivacaine 0.5%. Postoperative pain scores and analgesic use for the first 24 hrs were recorded. RESULTS: Eighty patients were enrolled in the study. After exclusions, data were analyzed on 39 patients in group T (bilateral TAP block) and 35 patients in group I (infiltration).

The main objective of this study was to compare the total dose of morphine required during the first two postoperative days. All patients received antiemetic prophylaxis and multimodal IV analgesia. RESULTS: Seventy patients were randomized. The total morphine consumption during the first two postoperative days was decreased by 51% in the block group compared with the control group (21 +/- 9 mg vs 41 +/- 24 mg, P < 0.0001). This difference was not only due to morphine titration, but remained significant over the following 2 days. The course of the visual analog scale was equivalent between the two groups.

Local anesthetic instillation of wounds through subcutaneous or subfascial catheters is used to treat postoperative pain in different types of surgery. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to study the opioid-sparing effect of these two techniques (if any) compared to placebo in women undergoing gynecologic procedures through transverse lower abdominal incisions. Methods Seventy-eight ASA I-III patients planned to undergo gynecologic procedures through a transverse lower abdominal incision were randomly divided into three equal groups: Control (C) group (n = 26), Continuous Wound Infusion (CWI) group (n = 26), and continuous transversus abdominis plane block (TAP) group (n = 26). After standardized general anesthetic and before extubation, the patients were given the allocated treatment. A morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was started postoperatively alongside with the local anesthetic (or placebo) infusion. Cumulative dose of morphine PCA in the first postoperative 48 h was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included visual analog pain score (VAS) at rest and on movement and complications of morphine PCA. Results The cumulative dose of morphine PCA in the first postoperative 48 h was higher in control group than in groups CWI and TAP (P < 0.001). However, no significant difference was found between groups CWI and TAP. No significant differences were found among the three groups regarding VAS during rest but TAP group showed less pain scores than groups C and CWI on movement. The three groups were similar regarding morphine side effects. Conclusion Continuous bilateral TAP block and CWI can decrease PCA morphine consumption in the first postoperative 48 h when compared to placebo in women undergoing gynecologic surgery through transverse lower abdominal incision. Continuous TAB block might give better analgesia with movement than CWI. 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Egyptian Society of Anesthesiologists.",English,0

PCA) are commonly used for pain relief following thoracic surgery. Many anaesthesiologists are reluctant to use thoracic epidural analgesia on general surgical wards. Therefore, we investigated in a prospective randomised study the efficacy of intercostal blocks (ICB) or interpleural analgesia (IPA) compared to PCA with systemic opioids (PCA). Following ethics committee approval and informed consent, 45 thoracotomy patients were randomised for postoperative pain management: group 1: intravenous PCA with piritramide (PCA-control), group 2: intercostal blocks of the segments concerned with 5 ml bupivacaine 0.5% at the end of surgery and 6 hours thereafter (ICB), group 3: interpleural analgesia with 20 ml bupivacaine 0.25% applied every 4 hours using a catheter placed during surgery near the apex of the pleural space (IPA). Patients in the ICB and IPA groups were able to obtain additional pain relief by PCA with piritramide. Alternative medication for all groups in case of insufficient analgesia was metamizol. Both regional analgesia groups used significantly less piritramide up to the 3rd (IPA) or 7th (ICB) postoperative day than the control group (p < 0.05). The consumption of metamizol was lower as well (n.s.). No significant differences between the study groups were observed with regard to pain scores (visual analogue scale VAS) at rest, during deep inspiration, coughing or mobilisation. Respiratory parameters as forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume (1 sec) and peak flow (FVC; FEV1; PF) were reduced significantly following thoracotomy and showed a slow restitution in all three study groups without major inter-group differences. Intercostal blocks and interpleural analgesia significantly reduce opioid demand following thoracotomy and are effective means of postoperative pain management. Nevertheless, in contrast to epidural analgesia, both methods have to be supplemented by, or combined with, systemic analgesics in most patients. On the other hand, compared to epidural analgesia, ICB and IPA are less invasive and easier to manage on general surgical wards. Copyright (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved.",,0

Moussa,2008.0,Opioid saving strategy: bilateral single-site thoracic paravertebral block in right lobe donor hepatectomy,", ","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postoperative analgesia after hepatectomy remains a challenge, mainly because of limited therapeutic index of the conventional opioids. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral single-site thoracic paravertebral block for the management of postoperative pain following right lobe donor hepatectomy (RLDH) using a prospective, randomized and controlled study design. METHODS: Twenty four adult patients, aged 18-50 years, ASA-I-II, of both sexes scheduled for right lobe donor hepatic resection, were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly allocated into 2 equal groups of 12 patients each. Before induction of general anesthesia, all patients received bilateral single-site thoracic paravertebral injection at the level of T7-8 in the sitting position. Patients of Group B were injected with 25 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 1:200.000 on each side. Patients of Group P were injected with 25 mL of 0.9% NaCl (placebo). General anesthesia was standardized in all patients. Postoperative pain score, analgesic requirements and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting were recorded. RESULTS: Bilateral single-site thoracic paravertebral block significantly decrease the pain visual analogue score parameters. Total morphine consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively was decreased by more than 50% in Group B (21.76 +/- 6.8 mg compared to 44.12 +/- 9.2 mg in Group P). There was significant prolongation in time to rescue analgesia (104.08 +/- 2.04 min in Group B, and 31.5 +/- 6.14 min in Group P). Postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly less in the active Group B when compared to the controlled Group P. CONCLUSION: Bilateral single-site thoracic paravertebral block is easy, safe and efficient technique for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing right lobe donor hepatectomy.",eng,1

http://ovidsp.ovid.com/athens?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed9&AN=2010419012","Background: Post-operative pain after open cholecystectomy can result in increased oxygen consumption, increased risk of myocardial ischemia, atelectasis, pneumonia, decreased vital capacity, and increased morbidity and mortality. In this study we compared the analgesic effects of intrapleural bupivacaine with intravenous morphine post-operatively. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients who were candidates for elective open cholecystectomy were randomly divided into two groups based on randomized numbers for a double-blinded randomized clinical trial. Anesthesia technique was precisely the same for all patients. At the end of surgery, 20 cc of 0.5% bupivacaine and epinephrine with a concentration of 1/200,000 was injected intrapleurally for group B patients; whereas, 0.1 mg/kg intravenous morphine and 20cc normal saline was injected intrapleurally for group M cases. Results: In order to obtain a visual analog scale(VAS) <3, morphine consumption up to 12 hours post-op was 10.5+3.2 mg in group M which was much more than that of group B, in which this amount was 4.3+1.5 mg. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The mean frequency of morphine injection was 3.7+1.3 times in group M and 1.2+0.7 times in group B and the difference in this regard was statistically significant. The patients' first demand for morphine was 1.8+0.6 and 4.2+0.3 hours postoperatively for groups M and B respectively. The difference in this regard was statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusion: In this study we realized that a single shot of intrapleural bupivacaine can provide an almost favorable analgesia for the management of post-operative pain due to open cholecystectomy compared to other current analgesic methods. It may reduce the related complications as well. We observed no complication due to the single shot of intrapleural bupivacaine. 2010 NRITLD.",English,1

Intermittent bolus versus continuous infusion,", ","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of continuous axillary brachial plexus block by infusion and by intermittent injection of bupivacaine 0.25% in the management of postoperative pain. METHODS: Two methods of continuous axillary brachial plexus block for pain management were compared in a prospective randomized trial. Twenty 16- to 62-year-old male patients (ASA I and II), undergoing microsurgery, received 0.25% bupivacaine following surgery, by either continuous infusion (group C, n = 10), or intermittent hourly bolus (group B, n = 10), via an axillary brachial plexus catheter inserted prior to operation. Efficacy assessments and analysis of plasma bupivacaine levels were performed for up to 38 hours postsurgery. RESULTS: There was no difference between groups with respect to pain scores, degree of motor block, or supplemental narcotic requirements. Plasma bupivacaine levels were higher in group C, with the difference reaching significance after 26 hours (means +/- SEM: C = 1.03 +/- 0.10 micrograms/mL, B = 0.73 +/- 0.08 microgram/mL, P < .05). There were no significant differences in cumulative bupivacaine doses or infusion rates between the groups. Complications included one case of axillary artery puncture at insertion, two unplanned premature catheter removals, and a self-limited grand mal convulsion in a known epileptic. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, both techniques provided safe and effective postoperative analgesia. As compared with continuous infusion, intermittent bolus administration resulted in lower plasma bupivacaine levels despite similar infusion rates.",eng,0

Zangrillo,2009.0,A comparison of epidural vs. paravertebral blockade in thoracic surgery,", ","AIM: Epidural analgesia is considered to be the best method of pain relief after major surgery despite its side-effects, which include hypotension, respiratory depression, urinary retention, incomplete or failed block, and, in rare cases, paraplegia. Paravertebral block is an alternative technique that may offer a comparable analgesic effect and a better side-effect profile. This study measured postoperative pain and respiratory function in patients randomized to receive either paravertebral block or epidural analgesia for pain control after thoracic surgery. METHODS: Twenty-four adult patients undergoing thoracic surgery were enrolled in a prospective and randomized clinical study. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either postoperative continuous paravertebral analgesia (N=12) or epidural analgesia (N=12) starting at pleura closure. Postoperative use of morphine, visual analogue scores, and spirometer data were collected for 72 hours after surgery as markers of pain relief. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant (P=0.003) increase in median (25th-75th percentiles) patient-controlled use of morphine, with values of 36 (22-42) mg in the paravertebral group vs. 9 (2-22) mg in the epidural group. This increase in morphine usage in the paravertebral group was statistically significant at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Postoperative pain measured with the visual analogue score was not significantly different in the two groups. Spirometer values at 72 h were better in the epidural group than in the paravertebral group (P=0.03).

We evaluated its analgesic efficacy over the first 48 postoperative hours after cesarean delivery performed through a Pfannensteil incision, in a randomized controlled, double-blind, clinical trial. METHODS: Fifty women undergoing elective cesarean delivery were randomized to undergo TAP block with ropivacaine (n = 25) versus placebo (n = 25), in addition to standard postoperative analgesia comprising patient-controlled IV morphine analgesia and regular diclofenac and acetaminophen. All patients received a standard spinal anesthetic, and at the end of surgery, a bilateral TAP block was performed using 1.5 mg/kg ropivacaine (to a maximal dose of 150 mg) or saline on each side. Each patient was assessed postoperatively by a blinded investigator: in the postanesthesia care unit and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postoperatively. RESULTS: The TAP block with ropivacaine compared with placebo reduced postoperative visual analog scale pain scores. Mean (+/- sd) total morphine requirements in the first 48 postoperative hours were also reduced (66 +/- 26 vs 18 +/- 14 mg, P < 0.001), as was the 12-h interval morphine consumption up to 36 h postoperatively. The incidence of sedation was reduced in patients undergoing TAP blockade. There were no complications attributable to the TAP block.

We hypothesize that blockade of scalp nerves prior to headframe placement reduces the incidence of moderate to severe head pain during the entire treatment day. We describe a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of awake patients having radiosurgery for intracranial pathology that examines whether scalp nerve blockade and local anesthetic infiltration results in superior patient comfort versus infiltration alone. METHODS: Twenty seven adult patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery were randomized to receive a nerve block with placebo or bupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine. Supraorbital and greater occipital nerve blocks using blinded syringes were performed by the anesthesiologist in addition to subcutaneous infiltration of pin sites with lidocaine 1% by the surgeon. Pain was reported using 10 cm visual analog scales (VAS) at pre-specified time points during the treatment day.

METHODS: Seventy-seven boys undergoing outpatient urologic surgery were randomized into one of three groups: general anesthesia alone, general anesthesia and caudal nerve block, or general anesthesia and local nerve block. Pain scores, frequency of medication, and total dosage of medication were recorded in the immediate postoperative period. Long-term pain and discomfort were measured using a 24-hour and 1-week questionnaire. RESULTS: The caudal and local groups had lower pain scores and significantly lower medication requirements than the control group in the short-term postoperative period. The caudal group had lower pain scores than the local group in all categories; however, the only significant difference was at 24 hours postoperatively. At 1 week postoperatively, the only difference among the three groups was a lower pain score in the caudal group compared with the control group.

Wu,2007.0,Effect of postoperative analgesia on major postoperative complications: a systematic update of the evidence,10.1213/01.ane.0000255040.71600.41,"BACKGROUND: Few individual clinical trials have had sufficient subject numbers to definitively determine the effects of postoperative analgesia on major outcomes. METHODS: We systematically searched the Medline and the Cochrane Library databases for the past decade and focused on meta-analyses and large, randomized, controlled trials. RESULTS: Eighteen meta-analyses, 10 systematic reviews, 8 additional randomized, controlled trials, and 2 observational database articles were identified for review or comment. Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics has the greatest theoretical potential to affect major outcomes and has been the most thoroughly investigated technique. The majority of evidence favors an ability of epidural analgesia to reduce postoperative cardiovascular and pulmonary complications only after major vascular surgery or in high-risk patients. This finding may become irrelevant because of rapid conversion of major surgery to minimally invasive techniques (e.g., endoluminal abdominal aortic repair) that carry less risk of complications. There is also consistent evidence that epidural analgesia with local anesthetics is associated with faster resolution of postoperative ileus after major abdominal surgery. Again, this finding may also become irrelevant with the adoption of laparoscopic techniques and multimodal fast-track programs for abdominal surgery. There is no current evidence that perineural analgesia, continuous wound catheters using local anesthetics, IV patient-controlled analgesia with opioids, or addition of multimodal systemic analgesics have any clinically significant beneficial effect on postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is insufficient evidence to confirm or deny the ability of postoperative analgesic techniques to affect major postoperative mortality or morbidity. This is primarily due to typically insufficient subject numbers to detect differences in currently low incidences of postoperative complications.",eng,1

At the end of surgery, patients in group 1 were given bilaterally an injection of 0.5% interpleural bupivacaine (10 ml) through the surgical endoscope, whereas those in the group 2 who were not given any treatment at the juncture served as control. Postoperatively, intravenous morphine 2.5 mg was given luxuriously to the patients at their request at intervals of 30 min. The intensity of postoperative pain was assessed at rest and during cough with visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-10 points). RESULTS: It was showed that at rest the pain scores were less in group 1 than in group 2 within 4 h postoperatively. During cough, group 1 also had less VAS scores than group 2 within 5 h postoperatively. Furthermore, patients in group 1 consumed less intravenous morphine than those in group 2 within 6 h postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Interpleural bupivacaine significantly decreased the intensity of postoperative pain and morphine consumption in patients undergoing transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy for palmar hyperhidrosis. We are looking forward to seeing that with the addition of epinephrine to the anesthetic solution and a considerable increase of dosage and/or volume of bupivacaine may provide a better and longer pain relief, about which further studies are needed.",eng,0
Journal Article,W. Leidinger; P. Schwinn; H. M. Hofmann; J. N. Meierhofer,2005.0,Remifentanil for analgesia during retrobulbar nerve block placement,", ","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients undergoing eye surgery under regional anaesthesia often require concomitant medication for analgesia and comfort. Remifentanil, with its ultra-short acting-profile, may be useful to reduce pain during retrobulbar nerve block for cataract surgery. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to compare the efficacy of remifentanil for analgesia during retrobulbar nerve block placement. Ninety patients undergoing cataract surgery were randomly divided to receive either remifentanil 0.3 microg kg(-1) (n = 45) or an equivalent volume of saline (n = 45). The injection was administered within 30 s in both groups. Patients rated their amount of pain on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Respiratory frequency, oxygen saturation, cardiac rhythm and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were recorded. RESULTS: The mean visual analogue score in the Remifentanil group was 2.56; it was 5.51 in the Saline group (P = 0.001, U-test). Three patients developed bradycardia and three had PONV in the Remifentanil group. Two patients developed tachycardia and one had PONV in the Saline group. No patient developed respiratory depression. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing retrobulbar block placement for eye surgery, 0.3 microg kg(-1) remifentanil over 30 s significantly reduced their reported pain. In addition, remifentanil did not increase the risk of untoward side-effects.",eng,0

This study was designed to determine their effect on lung functions and post-operative pain in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy. Materials and Methods: A total of 120 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 and 2 patients scheduled to undergo breast surgery were randomly allocated to receive IPB (Group IPB, n = 60) or paravertebral block (PVB) (Group PVB, n = 60) with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine pre-operatively. A standard protocol was used to provide general anesthesia. Lung function tests, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain at rest and movement, analgesic consumption were recorded everyday post-operatively until discharge. Results: Lung functions decreased on 1 <sup>st</sup> post-operative day and returned to baseline value by 4 <sup>th</sup> post-operative day in both groups. VAS was similar in both groups. There was no significant difference in the consumption of opioids and diclofenac in both groups. Complete block was achieved in 48 patients (80%) in paravertebral group and 42 patients (70%) in inter pleural group. Conclusion: To conclude, lung functions are well-preserved in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy under general anesthesia supplemented with paravertebral or IPB. IPB is as effective as PVB for post-operative pain relief. PVB has the added advantage of achieving a more complete block.",English,0

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that local wound infusion with bupivacaine followed by continuous infusion could reduce postoperative need for opioids in patients undergoing retropubic prostatectomy. DESIGN: Single-centre prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: A major university hospital in Denmark. PATIENTS: Following written informed consent, 60 patients scheduled for prostatectomy were recruited to the study and 50 completed the protocol to reach data analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty millilitre bolus of bupivacaine (2.5 mg ml) or isotonic saline was injected through a subfascially placed wound catheter followed by continuous infusion at 5 ml h during the following 48 h. All patients were prescribed paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, morphine and oxycodone if needed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the opioid requirement. Secondary outcomes included pain scores at rest and with activity, and nausea and vomiting scores. RESULTS: The total amount of morphine required during the postoperative period was not significantly higher (P=0.49) in the placebo group (12 mg, 25 to 75% percentile 5 to 18) than the bupivacaine group (10 mg, 25 to 75% percentile 0 to 16). Similarly, the total amount of oxycodone required was not significantly different (P=0.99) and was equal among the groups (5 mg, 25 to 75% percentile 5 to 10). At 2 h postoperatively, a significantly (P=0.0488) higher number of patients required additional morphine in the placebo group. No differences between the groups were detected at any time point regarding pain scores or the presence of nausea and vomiting. CONCLUSION: Additional use of a wound catheter in patients undergoing prostatectomy in the present perioperative setting appears superfluous.",eng,0

This study was aimed to compare two analgesic regimens after posterolateral thoracotomy. 80 patients (40-70 years) undergoing thoracotomy were randomized to intercostal catheter analgesia (group A, n = 40) and intercostal nerve block (group B, n = 40). Patients in group A were given 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine injections twice a day by intercostal catheter. Intercostal nerve blockade was performed using 5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine. Intercostal nerve in thoracotomy wound, nerves below and above thoracotomy wound was also injected. PaO2, PaCO2, FVC, FEV1 and visual analog pain scale (VAS) were obtained preoperatively, 24, 48 and 72 hours after operation. Postoperative complications were recorded at the patient discharge. Differences between groups were calculated using Mann-Whitney, KW test and chi square test. The arterial blood gas analyses did not show statistically significant change in any group and time according to the baseline values. FVC and FEV1 decreased significantly in both groups at first postoperative day according to baseline measurements. Patients in B group had significantly higher FEV1 values in the third postoperative day (73.05 +/- 11.25 in A vs. 83.50 +/- 9.17 in B group, p < 0.05).

All the patients were divided into 3 groups. In the 1-st group a total intravenous anaesthesia - TIV4 (propofol and fentanyl) was used. In the 2nd and 3rd groups was used combined anaesthesia: in the 2nd - TIVA + superficial CPB, in the 3rd - combined anesthesia (sevortane+fentanyl+CPB). When analyzing the results, BP, BIS data, anaesthetic doses and the need for opioid analgesics were evaluated. Assessment of the postoperative pain quality was conducted within 48 hours of the postoperative period on a verbal assessment scale (VAS). RESULTS: The need for fentanyl was considerably higher in the 1st group. The analysis of the BP data dynamics showed better stability in the 2nd and 3rd groups. CONCLUSIONS: TIVA + CPB provides better analgesia and reduces the need for opioid analgesics; greater stability of hemodynamic parameters during operation stages, as well as the best brain perfusion during a. carotis interna occlusion; postoperative analgesia and allows to avoid the early appointment of systemic analgesics.",rus,0

However, the overall analgesic efficacy of TAP blocks is unclear. We have performed a meta-analysis to further examine this issue. Method: This study qualified for exemption from the Johns Hopkins IRB. Systematic literature searches of the National Library of Medicineas PubMed and EMBASE databases were conducted using terms related to transversus abdominis plane blocks. Only randomized controlled trials comparing TAP block with local anesthetic to control (either saline block or no block) were included for analysis. Data on pertinent study characteristics and relevant outcomes were extracted from accepted articles. There was no restriction on language for inclusion. Meta-analysis was performed using the Review Manager 4.2.10 (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2004). A random effects model was used. Results: The literature searches yielded 110 abstracts of which 7 met all inclusion criteria. There were a total of 185 subjects for the TAP block group and 188 for the control group. We were able to obtain pooled estimates for VAS pain at 12 hours (all procedures), VAS pain at 24 hours (Cesarean section only), postoperative nausea and vomiting (all procedures), and sedation (all procedures). We were unable to obtain pooled estimate for other parameters (VAS pain at 6 and 24 hours for all procedures, morphine consumption at 24 hours) due to excessive heterogeneity. We found no significant differences in any of the pooled estimates for VAS pain at 12 hours (all procedures) [weighted mean differences (WM.D.): -0.63 (-1.31, 0.05)], VAS pain at 24 hours (Cesarean section only) [WM.D.: -0.33 (-1.00, 0.35)], postoperative nausea and vomiting (all procedures) [Odds ratio (OR): 0.35 (0.11, 1.14)], and sedation (all procedures) [OR: 0.37 (0.08, 1.80)]. Conclusions: Our pooled analysis examining the analgesic efficacy of TAP block for abdominal surgery did not reveal any differences (versus control) with regard to VAS pain at 12 hours (all procedures), VAS pain at 24 hours (Cesarean section only), postoperative nausea and vomiting (all procedures), and sedation (all procedures).

We compared a continuous subacromial infusion after single shot interscalene block (ISB), a continuous ISB with levobupi-vacaine and IV morphine PCA with preoperative ISB for patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Methods: After obtaining ethics committee approval and informed consent 120 patients were randomized to three groups, Group 1 (G1) ISB with 0.5% levobupivacaine (l-bupi) (30 mL) followed by a postoperative subacromial infusion: 0.125% l-bupi5mL/h basal infusion, 5mL bolus dose and a 20 min lockout time or; Group 2 (G2) ISB with 0.5% l-bupi (30 mL) followed by a postoperative interscalene infusion: 0.125% l-bupi 5 mL/h basal infusion, 5mL bolus dose and a 20 min lockout time; or Group 3 (G3) ISB with 0.5% l-bupi (30 mL) followed by a postoperative morphine PCA 0.3 mg/h basal infusion, 1mg bolus dose and a 20 min lockout time. Infusions were maintained for 24 hours. Results: The median VAS scores in the postanaesthesia care unit and at 4 h were not different. The median VAS scores at 8, 12, and 24 hours were < 4in all groups; but they were significantly lower in G2. There were no differences in VAS values of G1 and G3 patients. Additional analgesic requirements were lower in G2 (52.5% vs 7.5% vs 50% required additional analgesics respectively). Nausea and vomiting were more common in G3. Patients'satisfaction scores of groups were 8 +0,7 in G1, 9+ 0,8 in G2 and 7,1 +0,9 in G3 (G1 vs G3, p< 0,001). Conclusions: Subacromial infusion provided good postoperative analgesia for ASS, but it's less effective than ISB, but is superior to IV PCA because it causes less nausea and vomiting with higher patient satisfactions. Sub-acromial infusions can be considered as an alternative for postoperative pain treatment after ASS when ISB is contrainticated.",English,0

Greengrass,2000.0,Thoracic paravertebral block for breast surgery,", ","Cosmetic and reconstructive breast augmentation is a frequently performed surgical procedure. Despite advances in medical treatment, surgical intervention is often associated with postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting. Paravertebral nerve block (PVB) has the potential to offer long-lasting pain relief and fewer postoperative side effects when used for breast surgery. We compared thoracic PVB with general anesthesia for cosmetic breast surgery in a single-blinded, prospective, randomized study of 60 women scheduled for unilateral or bilateral breast augmentation or reconstruction. Patients were assigned (n = 30 per group) to receive a standardized general anesthetic (GA) or thoracic PVB (levels T1-7). Procedural data were collected, as well as verbal and visual analog pain and nausea scores. Verbal postoperative pain scores were significantly lower in the PVB group at 30 min (P = 0.0005), 1 h (P = 0.0001), and 24 h (P = 0.04) when compared with GA. Nausea was less severe in the PVB group at 24 h (P = 0.04), but not at 30 min or 1 h. We conclude that PVB is an alternative technique for cosmetic breast surgery that may offer superior pain relief and decreased nausea to GA alone. IMPLICATIONS: Paravertebral nerve block has the potential to offer long-lasting pain relief and few postoperative side effects when used for breast surgery. We demonstrated that paravertebral nerve block, when compared with general anesthesia, is an alternative technique for breast surgery that may offer pain relief superior to general anesthesia alone.",eng,0

This randomized controlled double-blinded trial investigated the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided TAP blocks for laparoscopic gastric-bypass surgery (LGBS). Materials and methods: Seventy patients undergoing LGBS were randomized to receive either bilateral ultrasound-guided subcostal TAP block injections after induction of general anesthesia or none. All patients received trochar insertion site local anesthetic infiltration and systemic analgesia. The primary outcome was cumulative opioid consumption (IV morphine equivalent) during the first 24 hours postoperatively. Interval opioid consumption, pain severity scores, and rates of nausea or vomiting were measured during Phase I recovery, and at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Results: There was no difference in cumulative opioid consumption during the first 24 hours postoperatively between the TAP (31.6 mg [95%CI: 26.9-36.4]) and control (34.2 mg [95%CI: 27.7-40.5]; P=0.52) groups. However, opioid consumption during Phase I recovery was significantly less in the TAP (13.5 mg [95%CI: 11.2-15.9]) compared to the control (17.2 mg [95%CI: 14.4-20.0]; P=0.04) group. Postoperative opioid consumption during the 24-48 hour interval was similar between groups, as were pain scores at rest and with movement during all measured intervals. The rate of nausea or vomiting was less during Phase I recovery in the TAP (13.8%) compared to the control (38.2%; P=0.04) group with no measurable differences during any interval thereafter. There were no complications related to any of the block procedures. Discussion: Bilateral TAP blocks performed prior to surgical incision do not provide additional analgesic benefit beyond Phase I recovery when added to trochar insertion site local anesthetic infiltration and systemic analgesia for laparoscopic gastric-bypass surgery.",English,0

METHODS: Forty-eight ASA class 1 children, scheduled for an elective tonsillectomy were randomized into three groups. Patients received lesser palatine nerve blocks, using divided doses of 0.05 ml/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine, 5 min prior to the beginning of tonsillectomy (Pre-block group) or immediately after surgery (Post-block group). Patients allocated into the Control group did not receive any nerve block. Postoperative pain was measured immediately after surgery, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours following operation using a 0 to 4 points pain scale, based on a facial expression of pain scale ruler. Side effects and the number of analgesic injections were observed for 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: No significant differences in the pain scores were observed immediately after surgery and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after operation in the three groups (P > 0.05). The number of analgesic injections was similar in the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study reveal that the lesser palatine nerve block was not effective for postoperative pain control following pediatric tonsillectomy, and that the pre-emptive block offered no pain control benefit over the postoperative block. Therefore, we do not recommend lesser palatine nerve blocks for the management of postoperative pain after pediatric tonsillectomy.",,0

Methods: Consenting patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal resection were randomized to either a TAP block (15ml 0.5% Marcaine to the left and right transversus abdominis space) or placebo (normal saline) placed intraoperatively under laparoscopic guidance. All were managed with a standardized ERP. Patient demographic, perioperative procedural, and postoperative outcomes were collected. The main outcome measures were post-operative pain and nausea/ vomiting (PONV) scores in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) and floor, opioid use, length of stay (LOS), and 30-day readmission rates for the TAP and control groups. Linear regression with a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach was used to model opioid use and pain scores longitudinally. Results: The trial randomized 41 patients to TAP and 38 patients to the control group. Demographic, clinical, and procedural data were not significantly different. In PACU, the TAP group had significantly lower pain scores (p<.01) and used less opioids (p<.01) than controls; PACU PONV scores were comparable (p=.99). TAP had significantly lower pain scores on postoperative day 1 (p=.04) and throughout the study period (p<.01). There was no significant difference between groups in postoperative opioid use (p=.65) or PONV (p=.79). The LOS (median 2 days TAP, 3 days control; p=.50) and readmission rate (7% TAP, 5% control, p=.99) was also similar across cohorts. Conclusions: In a randomized double-blinded controlled trial, TAP blocks improved immediate short-term opioid use and pain outcomes. Pain improvement was durable throughout the hospital stay. However, the TAP blocks did not translate into less overall narcotic use, shorter LOS, or lower readmission rates.

Materials and methods: Sixty patients aged between 19 and 76 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists risk scores of I-III scheduled to undergo elective unilateral inguinal hernia repair were included in the study. Randomization was achieved with sealed envelops containing randomization numbers. Before spinal anesthesia, one group (Group T) was administered TAP under the guidance of ultrasound, and the other group (Group P) was administered PVB, with concomitant regional nerve stimulation. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the patients before and during the operation and within postoperative 24 h were recorded. Results: There were no differences between the two groups with respect to demographic data, ASA scores, pre-, intra-, and postoperative blood pressures, Sp02, heart rates, operative times or complications. Relative to Group T, the VAS scores (at 30 min and at the 3rd, 6th and 12th h) of Group P were lower, the percentages of analgesic users were higher in the former during the first postoperative 12 h (Group T:66%, Group P: 35%).

Ho,2014.0,Thoracic paravertebral block and its effects on chronic pain and health-related quality of life after modified radical mastectomy,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AAP.0000000000000113,"Background and Objectives: Patients undergoing breast cancer surgery frequently experience chronic postoperative pain. The primary objective of this randomized study was to determine if thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) reduced the incidence of chronic pain after a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) when compared with general anesthesia (GA). METHODS: One hundred eighty women undergoing MRM were randomized to 1 of 3 study groups: group 1: standardized GA, group 2: GA with a single-injection TPVB and placebo paravertebral infusion, and group 3: GA with a continuous TPVB. Outcomes assessed postoperatively included acute postoperative pain and analgesic consumption and, at 3 and 6 months, the incidence and severity of chronic pain and physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQOL). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the incidence of chronic pain at 3 months (P = 0.13) and 6 months (P = 0.79) after the MRM between the study groups. The relative risk of developing chronic pain (P = 0.25) was also similar between the groups. There was no difference in acute pain (P = 0.22) or postoperative analgesic consumption (P = 0.67) between the groups. Nevertheless, differences were observed in chronic pain-related secondary outcome variables. The TPVB groups reported lower chronic pain scores (P < 0.05), exhibited fewer symptoms and signs of chronic pain (P < 0.01), and also experienced better physical and mental HRQOL than did the GA group. Chronic pain scores also decreased with time in all study groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference in the incidence or relative risk of chronic pain at 3 and 6 months after an MRM when TPVB is used in conjunction with GA. Nevertheless, patients who receive a TPVB report less severe chronic pain, exhibit fewer symptoms and signs of chronic pain, and also experience better physical and mental HRQOL. 2014 American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.",English,1

However there are no data on whether a TPVB affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in breast cancer survivors, which this study was designed to investigate. Methods: After ethical approval and written informed consent 180 women, less than 70 yrs, ASA 1-3, undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) were recruited for this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study. Patients were randomized to one of the three study groups: Gp 1 (standardized GA, control group), Gp 2 (GA with a preincisional single-injection TPVB and a paravertebral infusion of saline) and Gp 3 (GA with a preincisional single-injection TPVB and a continuous TPVB with 0.25% ropivacaine). Outcomes were recorded by a blinded outcome assessor before surgery, early postoperative period (72-h) and at 3 and 6 months (telephone interview) after discharge. Anxiety and depression was measured using HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). HRQOL was measured using the validated Hong Kong Chinese version of the Short Form-36 (SF-36). Repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal Wallis test and chi<sup>2</sup> test were used to compare outcome differences between groups. Results: Of the 180 women, 177 completed the study. The three study groups were comparable at baseline. Gp 1 required more (p=0.001) morphine during surgery than Gp 2 and Gp 3. There were no differences in pain scores at rest or on movement, between the groups, during the 72-h after surgery. The incidence of chronic pain (%, 95% CI) was comparable between the groups at 3 months [Gp 1, 73 (62-85), Gp 2, 60 (47-73) and Gp 3, 57 (44-70), p=0.13] and 6 months [Gp 1, 35 (23-47), Gp 2, 30 (18-42) and Gp 3, 30 (18-42), p=0.78]. During the follow up there was a difference in the mean pain score on movement over the operative site between groups (p=0.02). Compared to the Gp 1, Gp 3 had lower pain scores on movement over the operative site during the follow up (p=0.049). Patients in Gp 1 also reported more pain symptoms than in Gp 2 and Gp 3 at 3 months (p=0.02) and 6 months (p=0.04). The HADS score was comparable among the groups during the study except at discharge when more patients in Gp 1 were anxious (p=0.04) and depressed (p<0.01) than in the other groups. Table 1 shows the mean physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores of the SF-36 over time. For the PCS scores, at 3 months Gp 3 had higher (mean difference 3.6, 95% CI: 0.6 to 6.6) PCS scores than in Gp 1 but there was no difference between Gp 1 and Gp 2 (p=0.07). At 6 months, there was no difference in PCS scores between the groups (p=0.06). For the MCS scores, Gp 1 had significantly lower MCS scores than Gp 2 (p=0.01) [mean difference 4.4, 95%CI: 0.6 to 8.3] but not Gp 3 (p=0.123) during the follow up. Conclusions: Continuous TPVB reduces symptoms and severity of chronic pain, and produces a short-term improvement in physical HRQOL after MRM. A pre-incision single-injection TPVB also reduces symptoms and severity of chronic pain but seems to only improve mental HRQOL.",English,0

Lopez,2012.0,Pain management for tubal sterilization by hysteroscopy,", http://ovidsp.ovid.com/athens?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=coch&AN=00075320-100000000-07614","Background, Tubal sterilization by hysteroscopy involves inserting a foreign body in both fallopian tubes. Over a three-month period, the tubal lumen is occluded by tissue growth stimulated by the insert. Tubal sterilization by hysteroscopy has advantages over laparoscopy or mini-laparotomy, including the avoidance of abdominal incisions and the convenience of performing the procedure in an office-based setting. Pain, an important determinant of procedure acceptability, can be a concern when tubal sterilization is performed in the office., Objectives, To review all randomized controlled trials that evaluated interventions to decrease pain during tubal sterilization by hysteroscopy., Search methods, From January to March 2011, we searched the computerized databases of MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, LILACS, and CINAHL for relevant trials. We searched for current trials via . We also examined the reference lists of pertinent articles and wrote to known investigators for information about other published or unpublished trials., Selection criteria, We included all randomized controlled trials that evaluated pain management at the time of sterilization by hysteroscopy. The intervention could be compared to another intervention or placebo., Data collection and analysis, Initial data were extracted by one review author. A second review author verified all extracted data. Whenever possible, the analysis was conducted with all women randomized and in the original assigned groups. Data were analyzed using RevMan software. Pain was measured using either a 10-cm or 100-point visual analog scale (VAS). When pain was measured at multiple points during the procedure, the overall pain score was considered the primary treatment effect. If this was not measured, a summation of all pain scores for the procedure was considered to be the primary treatment effect. For continuous variables, the mean difference with 95% confidence interval was computed., Main results, Two trials met the inclusion criteria. The total number of participants was 167. Using a 10-cm VAS to measure pain, no significant difference emerged in overall pain for the entire procedure between women who received a paracervical block with lidocaine versus normal saline (mean difference -0.77; 95% CI -2.67 to 1.13). No significant difference in pain score was noted at the time of injection of study solution to the anterior lip of the cervix (mean difference -0.6; 95% CI -1.3 to 0.1), placement of the device in the tubal ostia (mean difference -0.60; 95% CI -1.8 to 0.7), and postprocedure pain (mean difference 0.2; 95% CI -0.8 to 1.2). Procedure time (mean difference -0.2 minutes; 95% CI -2.2 to 1.8 minutes) and successful bilateral placement (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.19 to 5.28) was not significantly different between groups. During certain portions of the procedure, such as placement of the tenaculum (mean difference -2.03; 95% CI -2.88 to -1.18), administration of the paracervical block (mean difference -1.92; 95% CI -2.84 to -1.00), and passage of the hysteroscope through the external (mean difference -2.31; 95% CI -3.30 to -1.32) and internal os (mean difference -2.31; 95% CI -3.39 to -1.23), use of paracervical block with lidocaine resulted in lower pain scores., Authors' conclusions, The available literature is insufficient to determine the appropriate analgesia or anesthesia for sterilization by hysteroscopy. Compared to paracervical block with normal saline, paracervical block with lidocaine reduced pain during some portions of the procedure. Intravenous sedation resulted in lower pain scores during insertion of the second tubal device. However, neither paracervical block with lidocaine nor conscious sedation significantly reduced overall pain scores for sterilization by hysteroscopy.",English.,1

Both procedures are usually performed percutaneously with considerable failure rates. A subpleural catheter placed in the space posterior to the parietal pleura and alongside the paravertebral area may provide superior postoperative pain relief. OBJECTIVE: To compare subpleural analgesia with thoracic epidural analgesia in patients undergoing thoracotomy. DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind study. SETTING: A tertiary care University Medical Centre between 26 June 2008 and 21 March 2011. PATIENTS: Forty-two patients scheduled for elective posterolateral thoracotomy. Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status >/=4, with a previous history of thoracotomy, on chronic pain medications or with a contraindication to receiving local anaesthetics or thoracic epidural block were excluded from the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to receive either subpleural analgesia or thoracic epidural analgesia for 24-h post-thoracotomy pain control. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A visual analogue scale was used to assess pain at rest and on coughing during the first 24 h postoperatively and the incidence of hypotension was recorded. RESULTS: Patients who received subpleural analgesia had higher visual analogue scores at rest and on coughing than those who received thoracic epidural analgesia. Seven patients who started with subpleural analgesia were treated with thoracic epidural analgesia at a mean (SD) of 3.9 (4.8) h. The remaining 14 patients had a median (IQR [range]) visual analogue score of 5 cm (4-5 [3-6]) at rest and were maintained on subpleural analgesia until the end of the study. The visual analogue score at rest was <7 cm in all 21 patients who received thoracic epidural analgesia and none was switched to subpleural analgesia during the study. None of the patients in the subpleural analgesia group experienced hypotension compared with five of the 21 patients in the thoracic epidural analgesia group (P=0.047). CONCLUSION: Thoracic epidural analgesia is superior to subpleural analgesia in relieving post-thoracotomy pain.",eng,0

Neuraxial morphine is currently the gold standard"" treatment for pain after cesarean delivery. In this study we tested the hypothesis that subarachnoid morphine would provide more prolonged and superior analgesia than would transversus abdominis plane block in patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery. METHODS: In this prospective, double-blind study, 57 patients were randomly assigned to receive either subarachnoid morphine (group SAM; n = 28) or transversus abdominis plane block (group TAP; n = 29). Patients received bupivacaine spinal anesthesia combined with morphine 0.2 mg in group SAM and received saline in group TAP. At the end of surgery, bilateral transversus abdominis plane block was performed using saline in group SAM or using bupivacaine 0.375% plus epinephrine 5 microg/mL in group TAP with 20 mL on each side. Postoperative analgesia for the first 24 hours consisted of scheduled rectal diclofenac and IV paracetamol; breakthrough pain was treated with IV tramadol. For the next 24 hours, scheduled rectal diclofenac was given; oral paracetamol and IV tramadol were administered upon patient request. Patients were assessed postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (time 0 hours) and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours. The primary outcome measure was the time to first analgesic request. RESULTS: Median (range) time to first analgesic request was longer in group SAM than in group TAP [8 (2-36) hours versus 4 (0.5 to 29) hours (P = 0.005)]. Median (range) number of tramadol doses received between 0 and 12 hours was 0 (0-1) in group SAM versus 0 (0-2) in group TAP (P = 0.03). Postoperative visceral pain scores at rest and on movement during first the 4 hours were lower in group SAM than in group TAP, but were not different at any other time points. The incidence of moderate to severe nausea was higher in group SAM than in group TAP [13/28 (46%) versus 5/29 (17%) (P = 0.02)]. More patients developed pruritus requiring treatment in group SAM than in group TAP [(11/28 (39%) versus none (0%) (P < 0.001)]. CONCLUSION: As part of a multimodal analgesic regimen, subarachnoid morphine provided superior analgesia when compared with ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block after cesarean delivery, yet at the cost of increased side effects.""",eng,1

However, the postoperative pain remains the main problem of the postoperative morbidity. The effectiveness of peritoneal blocks for analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is currently subject to many controversies. The aim of our study is to assess the analgesic effects of intraperitoneal administration of 40 mL of lidocaine 1% after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study including 40 patients. Informed writ ten consent and approval of the ethics committee were obtained. Inclusion criteria included women between 20 and 60 years old, weighing over 50 kg with ASA physical status I-II. Patients were randomly assigned into 2 equal groups after induction of anesthesia. Group 1 (lidocaine) : comprising patients who received instillation of 40 ml of 1% lidocaine ; 20 ml under the right diaphragm and 20 ml on the gallbladder bed ; group 2 (placebo) : instillation in the same way but with 40 ml of saline serum. The instillation was practiced at the end of the intervention in Trendelenburg position maintained for 10 min, by the surgeon guided by his camera. Postoperative pain was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) Results and Discussion: The two groups were comparable regarding demographic data, the total intraoperative fentanyl dose and the duration of the intervention. The mean VAS scores at rest were significantly lower in the lidocaine group (p < 0.05). Patients with severe pain (VAS > 50) were greater in the placebo group (17/20) than in the lidocain one (9/20), and this was significantly (p < 0.05). There were no side effects associated with intraperitoneal administration of lidocaine which pharmacokinetic study showed plasma concentrations below the toxic threshold (6?g/ml) Conclusion(s): Post laparoscopic cholecystectomy Analgesia provided by intraperitoneal administration of 40 mL of 1% lidocaine is an effective noninvasive and safety method, allowing in some cases, to perform these interventions in ambulatory.",English,0

The patient and attending investigators were blinded; the PVB or the sham block was performed behind a curtain by an anesthesiologist not involved in the study. The patients given PVB with bupivacaine needed 40% less IV opioid medication (primary outcome variable) in the postanesthesia care unit, had a longer latency to the first opioid dose, and had less pain at rest after 24 h than the control patients (P < 0.01). They also had less PONV in the postanesthesia care unit (P < 0.05), were less sedated until 90 min (P < 0.05), and performed better in the digit symbol substitution test at 90 min and the ocular coordination test 60-120 min after surgery (P < 0.05). The average peak bupivacaine plasma concentration was 750 ng/mL. One patient had bilateral convulsions immediately after bupivacaine injection.

Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. After informed consent 160 patients were randomized into PVB (n = 78) or infiltration (INF, n = 82) group. All patients were operated under spinal anaesthesia (hyperbaric bupivacaine 6 mg + fentanyl 15mug). PVB was performed at Th11-L1 using 15 ml of ropivacaine 5 mg/ml before the spinal block whereas the INF group had the same dose of ropivacaine infiltrated in the wound by the surgeon at the end of surgery. We registered pain (0-10), consumption ofanalgesics, spread ofanalgesia, duration ofspinal block, and voiding. Patients kept a symptom diary for a week and telephone interviews were performed up to 12 months postoperatively. Results: Cephalad spread of spinal anaesthesia was higher (Th7 vs. Th8, p < 0.001), time to resolution of motor block at the knee (102 vs. 78 min, p < 0.005) and voiding (272 vs. 243 min, p < 0.005) were longer in the PVB group.

Journal Article,R. V. Kadam; J. B. Field,2011.0,Ultrasound-guided continuous transverse abdominis plane block for abdominal surgery,10.4103/0970-9185.83676,"INTRODUCTION: Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a new regional analgesic technique for postoperative pain in abdominal surgery. Its efficacy is not clear, and thus it needs to be explored for its regular utilisation on prolonged period. The objective was to study the continuous local anaesthetic infusion effect on postoperative analgesia. Continuous use of TAP block as an analgesic technique has not been evaluated prospectively in clinical trials. This study evaluates the efficacy of ultrasound-guided TAP block in comparison with PCA fentanyl in major abdominal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There were 20 patients in the study, allocated to TAP and control groups. The parameters measured were pain scores on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0-10 at various time intervals and the amount of fentanyl used as rescue analgesia. Patient satisfaction scores were recorded in the TAP block group and along with any complications related to the block. RESULTS: The postoperative median pain scores on coughing on day one were 6.0 for control group and 2.0 for the TAP group (P = 0.02); on day two, the equivalent scores were 7.0 and 2.0 (P = 0.01). The fentanyl requirement at one hour was 203 mu for the control group and 78 mug for the TAP group (P = 0.03); at day one, the control and TAP requirements were 1237 mug and 664 mug respectively (P = 0.01). Three TAP patients rated their satisfaction as 'excellent', four as 'satisfied, and two as 'poor'. CONCLUSION: TAP block is a promising technique for postoperative analgesia in major abdominal surgeries. Our study demonstrated lower pain scores in the TAP group with reduced fentanyl requirement. Further, a large scale study is needed to establish the efficacy of TAP block in this setting.",eng,0

We wanted to compare those two methods and their influence on postoperative VAS score and morphine consumption on patients after hysterectomy. Methods: 30 female patients (ASA I-II) sheduled for total abdominal hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were randomized in two groups. Group A (13 patients) received TAP block billateraly after induction of anesthesia and in group B (17 patients) a 20-gauge epidural catheter was placed above superficial abdominal fascia at the end of operation. Group A received 1,5 ml/kg of 0,25 % bupivacain and group B received through the catheter 0,25 % bupivacain 10 ml bolus folowed by 7 ml/h for 48 hours. Both groups also recieved diclofenac 75 mg every 12 hours for 48 h and patient controled analgesia with morphine iv. Results: Mann-Whitney test was used to analyze VAS and morphine consumption. Morphine consumption in the first 24 hours was the only variable statistically significantly lower in the TAP group (median=10 mg in group B, 6 in group A, p< 0,04). There was no differences in incidence of nausea and occurence of peristalsis. Conclusions: Statistically significantly lower morhine consumption and tendency towards lower VAS in TAP group indicate that TAP might be a more efficacious analgesic method but larger studies are needed to confirm our preliminary results.",English,0

http://ovidsp.ovid.com/athens?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=71018453","Objectives: To compare the pain scores, opioid consumption and patient satisfaction between patients who received peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) with general anaesthesia (GA) and parenteral opioids versus those who received GA and opioids alone - the conventional method of management of lower limb orthopaedic procedures at the University Hospital of the West Indies (UHWI). Design and Method: This was a randomized, single-centre, prospective cohort of patients 16-66 years, ASA I-II undergoing lower limb orthopaedic surgery at UHWI betweenAugust and December 2011. In group B, a peripheral nerve blockade of the lumbar plexus +/- sciatic nerve was established under sedation prior to GA, using a peripheral nerve stimulator and ultrasound. Both groups received a standardized GA and were followed for 24 hours postoperatively. Pain intensity, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, satisfaction with the anaesthetic procedure and pain management and postoperative analgesic consumption were assessed. Patients received intravenous morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg for analgesia in the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) based on clinical parameters, a verbal response (VRS) pain scale and the visual analogue scale (VAS) and adjunct analgesics on the ward. Data were stored and analysed using the SPSS version 18. Categorical associations were assessed using Pearson's Chi-square and differences between means for normally distributed continuous variables were tested with independent t-test or analysis of variance as appropriate. All statistical tests were two-sided and performed at a significance level of 0.05. Results: Forty patients consented, 20 in each arm. Demographics, blood loss, length of operating time and types of operations performed were not significantly different between the two groups. The PNB+GA patients reported significantly lower pain scores up to 12 hours postoperatively (p < 0.05) and consumed less opioids in the operating theatre and postoperatively (1.5 vs 17 mg morphine; p < 0.001: 25 vs 225 mg pethidine; p < 0.0010) and less of other analgesics: diclofenac, p < 0.05; metamizole, p = 0.037 and paracetamol, p = 0.002. There was a significantly lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the PNB+GA group (10% vs 45%; p = 0.012). The latter spent a shorter time in the PACU (35% vs 80% at 90 minutes; p = 0.006) and also reported higher satisfaction 85% vs 15%. There were two complications in the PNB group: one transient neuropraxia and one sciatic nerve injury. Conclusion: This study confirms that PNB combined with GA provides better immediate postoperative pain management, less opioid consumption with greater satisfaction than GA and opioids alone. However, for this technique to become more readily available, administrators will have to address the need for adequate training of personnel and the lack of specialized equipment including peripheral nerve stimulators, stimulating needles and ultrasonography.",English,0

The publications are rare and the results are controversial (A Herbland Regl Anesth and Pain Medicine. 2006; (31): 34-39). We propose to evaluate the effectiveness of BCSB associated with infiltration of the scar in post thyroidectomy analgesia during the first 24 hours postoperative. Methods: Patients consenting ASA 1 ASA 3, proposed for thyroidectomy without dissection, are included in a prospective single-blind. 40 patients were randomized into 2 groups (group BI: BCSB associated with infiltration of the surgical scar and control group). The BCSB is achieved after skin closure and before the patient wakes up in the middle of the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid mastoid, next to the thyroid cartilage (15 ml bupivacaine 0.5%). The assessment of postoperative pain by VAS at the clock full patient (H0), then H1, H2, H4 and then every 4 hours during 24 hours postoperatively. In SSPI if VAS > 60 morphine titration to EVA = 40. For all patients the analgesia was supplemented with paracetamol (1g / 6h). Patient satisfaction was rated 1to5. The main outcome measures were the EVA, dose titration, adverses effects and patient satisfaction. Results: Our results are a preliminary study of 28 patients: (Control group: 14 patients, Group IB: 13 patients). A patient with thyroid carcinoma has been excluded from the study. The average VAS max gpe BI is lower than that of gpe control with a significant difference. morphine requirements are zero in the gpe BI while 28% of patients gpe controls required a titration (P < 0.005). Satisfaction overall was good to excellent in group BI and insufficient to average in the second groupe. Conclusions: Effectiveness of BCSB in postoperative analgesia of thy-roidectomy is a subject of controversy in the literature. In our study it can reduce pain, post thyroidectomy.",English,0

Tissue damage during these surgeries causes postoperative pain. Since pain management after surgery is of high importance, we evaluated the preventive effects of pudendal nerve block on postoperative pain in anterior and posterior vaginal wall repair. Methods: In a double-blind clinical trial study, 58 female candidates of anterior and posterior vaginal repair were randomly assigned to two groups. Using a nerve stimulator, pudendal nerve tracks of the intervention group were injected with 0.3 cc/kg bupivacaine 0.25%. Similar injections with normal saline were performed for the control group. A visual analogue scale was used to measure pain during the first 48 hours after the surgery. Data was analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Findings: Compared to the intervention group, the control group experienced greater pain during rest and walking. There were significant differences between the two groups from the first postoperative hour (P = 0.003) until 48 hours after the operation (P = 0.021). However, the mean + SD values of pain in sitting position was not significantly different the two groups (P = 0.340).

Cheng,1996.0,Comparison of subcutaneous ring block of the penis with caudal epidural block for post-circumcision analgesia in children,", ","A randomized, prospective, blind trial was conducted comparing caudal epidural blockade (caudal block) with subcutaneous ring block of the penis (penile ring block) in fifty healthy boys between two and twelve years of age undergoing elective circumcision. Subjects receiving caudal block had a longer duration of analgesia (P = 0.003), and took longer to first micturition (P = 0.04) but there was no difference in time taken to awaken from anaesthesia or spontaneously walk unaided. There was an 8% failure rate with the penile ring block but no local or systemic complications related to either block and a very low incidence of vomiting. It is concluded that both techniques are effective. Caudal block is more reliable and produces a longer duration of analgesia but penile ring block is inherently safer and has a lower incidence of adverse effects.",eng,0

METHODS: Preoperatively, patients (n = 30) received a sciatic nerve block and perineural catheter in the popliteal fossa. Postoperatively, patients were discharged with both oral opioids and a portable infusion pump delivering study solution (0.2% ropivacaine or 0.9% saline) via the catheter for 3 days. Investigators and patients were blinded to random group assignment. Daily end-points included pain scores, opioid use and side effects, sleep quality, and symptoms of catheter- or local anesthetic-related complications. RESULTS: Ropivacaine (n = 15) infusion significantly reduced pain compared with saline (n = 15) infusion ( < 0.001). For example, the average pain at rest (scale: 0-10) on postoperative day 1 (median, 25th -75th percentile) was 4.0 (3.5-5.5) for the saline group, versus 0.0 (0.0-0.0) for the ropivacaine group (P < 0.001). Oral opioid use and related side effects were significantly decreased in the ropivacaine group. For example, on postoperative day 1, median tablet consumption was 8.0 (5.0-10.0) and 0.0 (0.0-0.0) for the saline and ropivacaine groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Sleep disturbance scores were more than 10-fold greater for saline administration than for ropivacaine infusion (P < 0.001). Overall satisfaction was significantly greater in the ropivacaine group. Other than two inadvertent catheter dislodgements, no catheter- or local anesthetic-related complications occurred.

METHODS: Preoperatively, 60 subjects undergoing unilateral (n = 24) or bilateral (n = 36) mastectomy received either unilateral or bilateral paravertebral perineural catheter(s), respectively, inserted between the third and fourth thoracic transverse process(es). All subjects received an initial bolus of ropivacaine 0.5% (15 mL) via the catheter(s). Subjects were randomized to receive either perineural ropivacaine 0.4% or normal saline using portable infusion pump(s) [5 mL/h basal; 300 mL reservoir(s)]. Subjects remained hospitalized for at least 1 night and were subsequently discharged home where the catheter(s) were removed on postoperative day (POD) 3. Subjects were contacted by telephone on PODs 1, 4, 8, and 28. The primary end point was average pain (scale, 0-10) queried on POD 1. RESULTS: Average pain queried on POD 1 for subjects receiving perineural ropivacaine (n = 30) was a median (interquartile) of 2 (0-3), compared with 4 (1-5) for subjects receiving saline (n = 30; 95% confidence interval difference in medians, -4.0 to -0.3; P = 0.021]. During this same period, subjects receiving ropivacaine experienced a lower severity of breakthrough pain (5 [3-6] vs 7 [5-8]; P = 0.046) as well. As a result, subjects receiving perineural ropivacaine experienced less pain-induced physical and emotional dysfunction, as measured with the Brief Pain Inventory (lower score = less dysfunction): 14 (4-37) versus 57 (8-67) for subjects receiving perineural saline (P = 0.012). For the subscale that measures the degree of interference of pain on 7 domains, such as general activity and relationships, subjects receiving perineural saline reported a median score 10 times higher (more dysfunction) than those receiving ropivacaine (3 [0-24] vs 33 [0-44]; P = 0.035). In contrast, after infusion discontinuation, there were no statistically significant differences detected between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: After mastectomy, adding a multiple-day, ambulatory, continuous ropivacaine infusion to a single-injection ropivacaine paravertebral nerve block results in improved analgesia and less functional deficit during the infusion.

The subcostal transversus abdominis plane block is associated with a large area of spread (T7-L1). The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that US-guided TAP blocks can reduce opioid consumption during the first 24 h after of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in comparison with port site local anesthetic infiltration and systemic analgesia. Method Sixty-three ASA II/III adult patients listed for elective laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy were randomly allocated in one of three groups: Group I (OSTAP) received bilateral OSTAP block. Group II (Local) received local anesthetic infiltration at trocar port sites. Group III (Control) placebo group received TAP block and port site infiltration by same volumes of sterile normal saline. Twenty-four hours postopetrative morphine consumption, the dose of fentanyl (mug) required during surgery, equivalent morphine dose in the recovery unit (PACU) and first morphine dose were recorded. The quality of analgesia is assessed by Visual Analogue Scale for 24 h at rest and movement. Results The mean opioid consumptions in PACU showed significant difference between the three groups, P = 0.02. The mean 24 h morphine consumption showed statistically significant difference between groups (P value < 0.001). Significant differences were found between both OSTAP and Local groups with control group (P < 0.001) and also between OSTAP and Local groups (P = 0.02). Pain score of OSTAP group was significantly lower than local infiltration group at 6 and 4 h at rest and movement respectively. OSTAP group had faster extubation time than other groups. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were not significant between groups. No signs or symptoms of local anesthetic systemic toxicity or complications were detected. Conclusion Oblique subcostal TAP block is a good alternative for providing analgesia during the postoperative period. The block is easily performed using ultrasound guidance. It is safe, provides effective analgesia with significant morphine-sparing effect with reduced side-effects of opioids. 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.",English,1

Stable hemodynamics, normocapnia, and adequate pain relief are considered important factors in the reduction of neurological complications in pediatric patients undergoing encephaloduroarteriomyosynangiosis (EDAMS) operations for the treatment of moyamoya disease. A preoperative skull block may reduce hemodynamic fluctuations and hypo- or hyperventilation due to emergence delirium or oversedation and provide adequate pain relief, thereby reducing postoperative morbidity. Methods. Pediatric patients (age 3-13 years) undergoing EDAMS surgery for moyamoya disease were randomly divided into a nerve block (NB) group (18 cases) or control group (21 cases). The treatment group patients received a preoperative NB (0.25% 5-8 ml bupivacaine mixed with 20-40 mg methylprednisolone) targeting the supraorbital, supratrochlear, auriculotemporal, and posterior auricular nerves. Patients in the control group did not receive NB. General anesthesia with sevoflurane was induced in both groups. Results. In the NB group, stable hemodynamic parameters were obtained with a lower sevoflurane concentration than in the control group. For delirious awakening, the odds ratio in the control group was 4.9 compared with the NB group. Pain and analgesic requirement were higher in the control patients than in the NB-treated patients during the postanesthesia care unit stay. However, the arterial CO<sub>2</sub> tension in the postanesthesia care unit did not differ between the 2 groups. The odds ratio in the control group for the rate of morbidity (cerebral infarction and reversible ischemic neurological deficits) during the first 24 hours following the operation was 3.2 compared with the NB group. Conclusions. The use of skull block during EDAMS surgery provided easy hemodynamic control, calm awakening, and better pain relief and may be related to the reduced postoperative morbidity.",English,0

METHODS: Fifty-two patients scheduled for elective frontoparietal craniotomy for unruptured aneurysm clipping were enrolled. After surgery, scalp blocks were performed using normal saline (group C, n = 26) or 0.75% levobupivacaine (group L, n = 26). Postoperative pain scores and PCA consumption were recorded for 72 hours after recovery of consciousness. The time from patient recovery to the first use of PCA drug and rescue analgesics, the requirement for vasoactive agents, and adverse effects related to PCA and local anesthetics also were recorded. RESULTS: Postoperative pain scores and PCA consumption in group L were lower than in group C (P < .05). The time intervals from patient recovery to the first use of PCA drug (P < .001) and rescue analgesics (P = .038) was longer in group L than in group C. Additionally, less antihypertensive agent was required (P = .017), and PONV occurred less frequently (P = .039) in group L than in group C. CONCLUSIONS: Scalp blocks with 0.75% levobupivacaine improved recovery profiles in that it effectively lowered postoperative pain and PCA consumption without severe adverse events and also reduced the requirement for a postoperative antihypertensive agent and the incidence of PONV in patients who underwent frontoparietal craniotomy for aneurysm clipping.",Eng,1

We compared analgesic efficacy and side-effect profile of the TAP block and patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) following Caesarean section (CS). Methods: Fifty women undergoing elective CS were randomized to undergo TAP block with levobupivacaine 0.375% 20 mL bilaterally and saline PCEA (n=25) versus TAP block with saline and PCEA with levobupivacaine 0.03% with sufentanil 1mug/mL (n=25). All women received paracetamol and ketorolac for 48h. All patients received combined spinal epidural anaesthesia and a bilateral TAP block at the end of surgery. At the same time PCEA was started. Each patient was assessed postoperatively by a blinded investigator at regular time intervals for 6 days postoperatively. Visual analog scale score (VAS) for pain and side-effects were noted. Duration of hospitalisation and patient satisfaction were recorded. Data were analysed using appropriate statistical methods. Results: Nine patients were excluded from analysis because technical problems with the block occurred or a protocol violation was noted. Forty-one patients remained for final analysis. No demographic differences between groups were noted. VAS scores for pain were similar between the groups, at rest or during mobilisation, as well as patient satisfaction. The VAS score for PONV was lower in the TAP Group (2 +8 versus 20+29 in the PCEA Group). As well as the VAS score for pruritus (9 +15 versus 31+29 in the PCEA Group). Less patients in the TAP group complained of PONV and pruritus and more patients were mobile during the first 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusions: Multimodal analgesia using paracetamol, NSAID s and PCEA or TAP provides effective and comparable analgesia following CS. However, the side-effect profile improves when a TAP block is used and patients have less PONV, pruritus and are more mobile.",English,0

Placebo and EMLA cream were prepared by the pharmacy and applied by study nurses. Preloaded syringes of saline or 1% lidocaine were also prepared by the pharmacy for the DPNB injections. This ensured blinding of the surgeons and assistants at the time of circumcisions. Circumcisions were performed with the Gomco clamp technique by one of three obstetrics and gynecology residents. Pain levels were assessed by measuring pulse and respiratory rates and determining Brazelton states at each step of the circumcision. Videotapes were made of each procedure to allow later scoring by a single blinded observer for Brazelton states. Brazelton state scores increase with increased infant pain and distress, as do heart and respiratory rates. Means were compared by t test and proportions by chi(2). A P value of.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: A total of 60 infants were randomized, 29 to DPNB and 31 to EMLA. Preoperative Brazelton state scores, heart rates, and respiratory rates were similar in both groups. Brazelton state scores were lower in the DPNB group at each step of the procedure-injection, dissection of the foreskin, clamp placement, and clamp removal-and postoperatively and overall, but the differences only reached statistical significance during dissection and clamp removal. Heart and respiratory rates also were lower at all surgical steps in the DPNB group but only reached statistical significance during postoperative observation.Conclusions: Although both EMLA and DPNB have been shown in other studies to decrease pain during neonatal circumcisions, DPNB has greater effectiveness in relieving the pain of circumcision.",Eng,0

However, patients routinely complain of port site pain, particularly at large port sites with fascial closure. The transversus abdominis plan (TAP) block is a peripheral nerve block for treatment of anterior abdominal wall pain. Our goal was to determine whether preoperative TAP block decreases opiate requirements following robotic surgery for gynecologic cancer. Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebocontrolled trial comparing preoperative TAP block placement with saline injection in women undergoing robotic surgery. Blocks were placed in a standardized fashion using ultrasound guidance. The primary outcome was total 24-hour opiate use. Secondary endpoints included postoperative pain scores, length of hospital stay, and safety. Opiate use was converted to intravenous morphine equivalents and compared using a two-sample T-test. Pain was measured using a Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and outpatient pain diary. Secondary outcomes were analyzed using Chisquare and regression analysis. Results: Among the 64 subjects, total 24-hour opiate use did not differ significantly between the treatment and control groups (64.9 mg vs 69.3 mg, P=0.52). There was no difference in average postoperative pain scores as assessed by BPI (6.44 vs 6.97, P=0.37) or VAS (3.12 vs 3.61, P=0.30). There was no difference in average pain diary scores or outpatient opiate use between groups. TAP block was safely placed in 63 of 64 patients,with bodymass indexes (BMIs) ranging from 18.3 to 66.6. The control group was significantly younger (55.2 vs 62.1 years, P=0.028). After correction for age, the difference in total opiate use approached significance (P=0.085). Total opiate use showed a strong positive correlation with BMI (P=0.0012) and negative correlation with age (P=0.0008). Conclusions: In this population, TAP block was feasible, even in the morbidly obese. However, block placement did not decrease total opiate use or pain scores. The random age imbalance between groups may have masked effectiveness of the block. Further analysis revealed a quantifiable correlation between BMI, age, and total opiate use. These novel data can be organized into a nomogram to assist clinicians in appropriate and safe dosing of postoperative opiate analgesics (Figure). (Figure presented).""",English,0

This study assessed the safety and efficacy of using a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Forty-six patients were analyzed in the trial and were randomized to undergo the TAP block procedure with either bupivacaine (n=24) or saline placebo (Control n=22) injected into the muscle plane. Prefilled syringes were dispensed with the group allocation concealed to maintain blinding. After surgery, the amount of morphine, level of pain, and measures of recovery were recorded. RESULTS: The amount of morphine used 6 hr after surgery was significantly lower in patients receiving TAP block with bupivacaine compared with the control (presented as mean [SD], 12.4 [8.4] vs. 21.2 [14.0] mg; P=0.015). However, the total amount of morphine used was similar in both groups 45.6 [31.4] vs. 52.7 [28.8] mg; P=0.771. Patients in the bupivacaine group experienced significantly less pain on postoperative days 1 (score, 19 [15] vs. 37 [20]; P=0.003) and 2 (score, 11 [10] vs. 19 [13]; P=0.031). Recovery and postoperative hospital stay were similar in both groups. There were no complications associated with the procedure. CONCLUSION: The TAP block procedure is beneficial in reducing postoperative pain and early morphine requirements in laparoscopic live-donor nephrectomy.",eng,1

Materials and Methods: Following ethical approval, 30 patients were recruited in this single centre, double blind trial. Patients were randomised to receive either TAPB (landmark technique) with 1mg/kg 0.375% levobupivacaine or 'sham' subcutaneous injection. All patients received a standard analgesia regimen (morphine 0.1 mg/kg intraoperatively & PCA morphine postoperatively). Postoperative pain scores were assessed at 1, 4, 24 and 48 hours. Patient satisfaction was assessed with the QoR-40 questionnaire at 48 hours and incidence of chronic pain at 12 weeks using the short form McGill MPQ. Results: 29 patients completed the study with no significant differences between groups in either age or weight or mean intraoperative dose of morphine (7.7 vs 7.6 mg). There was no significant difference in pain scores between the two groups at anytime in the postoperative period (Table 2). (Data are Mean (SD) or number of times additional analgesia required.) Overall patient satisfaction was high with patients with mean satisfaction scores of 82% (TAPB) compared with 86% (PCA) (p=0.25). There was no significant difference between MPQ scores between the two groups (p=0.68), however 26% patients had an incidence of chronic postoperative pain. Conclusions: This study further demonstrates the unclear position of TAPB in postoperative pain management despite previously encouraging studies. (Table Presented).",English,0

A prospective randomized clinical study,", http://ovidsp.ovid.com/athens?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed9&AN=70162250","Background and Goal of Study: Epidural anaesthesia (EDA) is considered to be the golden standard"" to maintain respiratory function after lung surgery and to reduce number of pulmonary complications. An intraoperatively performed intercostal nerve block (ICB) plus intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) with opioids could be an less time consuming and safer alternative to EDA, but data evaluating the postoperative respiratory function are scarce. The aim of the present study was to investigate if an ICB plus IV-PCA with morphine is as effective as an EDA with respect to respiratory function after lung surgery. Materials and Methods: With approval of the local ethic committee 83 patients were randomly allocated to the EDA-Group (n = 40) or ICB-Group (n = 43). Patients in the ICB-Group received intraoperatively a 5 segment intercostal block with 30 ml ropivacaine 0.75% and postoperatively IV-PCA with morphine. Patients in the EDA Group received intraoperatively ropivacaine 1% through a thoracic epidural catheter (TH6-TH8) and postoperatively patient controlled EDA with ropivacaine 0.2% and sufentanil 2mug/ml. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were used to analyze respiratory function preoperatively (Pre-OP), at the evening of operation (post-OP) and at the first four postoperative days (POD 1-4). Results and Discussion: The median values of FVC, FEV1 and PEF are given in the table. Overall postoperatively the EDA-Group demonstrated a better respiratory function compared to the ICB-Group. At the POD 2 all respiratory parameters measured were significantly higher in the EDA-Group (*; p < 0,05). {Table presented} Conclusion(s): Regarding the respiratory function ICB with subsequent IV-PCA is not as effective as patient controlled EDA in patients undergoing lung surgery.

Newman,2006.0,"Efficacy of single-dose, multilevel paravertebral nerve blockade for analgesia after thoracoscopic procedures",", ","BACKGROUND: Although video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for pulmonary resection is increasingly chosen over thoracotomy, the optimal analgesia regimen for thoracoscopy is unknown. The purpose of this trial was to compare the efficacy of analgesia from preoperative bupivacaine paravertebral nerve blockade with that from placebo injections. METHODS: Eighty adult patients undergoing unilateral thoracoscopic procedures were enrolled in a prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of preoperative, multilevel, single-dose paravertebral nerve blockade. Patients received six paravertebral injections with 5 ml of either 0.5% bupivacaine with 0.0005% epinephrine (treated, n = 40) or preservative-free saline (control, n = 40). Cumulative weight-adjusted intraoperative fentanyl and postoperative patient-controlled morphine usage, visual analog pain scores, and spirometry were used to compare efficacy of analgesia between groups. RESULTS: The treated group received significantly less intraoperative fentanyl compared with the control group (P = 0.003) and had a 31% smaller cumulative patient-controlled morphine dose (P = 0.03) in the 6 h after block placement. Within 6 h, treated patients also reported lower maximum pain scores (P = 0.02) and demonstrated less pain score variability (P = 0.01). No statistically significant difference in cumulative morphine usage existed at 12 or 18 h after block placement. No significant difference in spirometry, cortisol levels, or cytokine production was found between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose paravertebral nerve blockade with bupivacaine is effective in reducing pain after thoracoscopic surgery, but only during the first 6 h after nerve blockade. Because of the limited duration of effect with currently available local anesthetic agents, the current data suggest that, at present, this technique is not indicated in the setting of thoracoscopic surgery.",eng,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was performed in 30 patients who underwent craniotomy for excision of a tumor. The cranial nerve block was performed using saline (control group, n=15) or 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine at 1:200 000 (bupivacaine group, n=15). Morphine (2 mg, intravenous bolus) was used for rescue analgesia. Pain was assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS) at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours following the cranial nerve block. The following data were recorded: time elapsed until appearance of pain, use of rescue analgesia, and incidence of adverse effects. RESULTS: The use of morphine was significantly lower in the group of patients who received a cranial nerve block with bupivacaine than in the control group (mean [SD], 3.7 [1.6] mg vs 172 [2.5] mg). The mean time to the first requirement for rescue analgesia was longer in the bupivacaine group than in the control group (731 [247] minutes vs 80 [71] minutes). The VAS score during the first 16 hours was significantly lower in the bupivacaine group than in the control group. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly higher in the control group (67% vs 13%).

However, there is currently no evidence from randomized, controlled studies investigating the possible benefits of continuous TAP blocks. Therefore, the aim of this randomized, triple-masked, placebo-controlled study was to determine if benefits are afforded by adding a multiple-day, ambulatory, continuous ropivacaine TAP block to a single-injection block following hernia surgery. METHODS: Preoperatively, subjects undergoing unilateral inguinal (N = 19) or peri-umbilical (N = 1) hernia surgery received unilateral or bilateral TAP perineural catheter(s), respectively. All received a ropivacaine 0.5% (20 mL) bolus via the catheter(s). Subjects were randomized to either postoperative perineural ropivacaine 0.2% or normal saline using portable infusion pump(s). Subjects were discharged home where the catheter(s) were removed the evening of postoperative day (POD) 2. Subjects were contacted on POD 0-3. The primary endpoint was average pain with movement (scale: 0-10) queried on POD 1. RESULTS: Twenty subjects of a target 30 were enrolled due to the primary surgeon's unanticipated departure from the institution. Average pain queried on POD 1 for subjects receiving ropivacaine (N = 10) was a mean (standard deviation) of 3.0 (2.6) vs 2.8 (2.7) for subjects receiving saline (N = 10; 95% confidence interval difference in means -2.9 to 3.4; P = 0.86). There were no statistically significant differences detected between treatment groups in any secondary endpoint.

The choice of treatment method for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia can be dictated by the lesion size, by comfort of the operator with the technique, by the cost of the procedure, and by patient comfort with the procedure. The purpose of this research was to compare the usual method of cryosurgery (no anesthetic block) with a method using a paracervical block to reduce the pain and cramping associated with cryosurgery. METHODS. A prospective trial was designed and conducted in a colposcopy clinic. Of the 85 women enrolled in the study, all were immediately given 550 mg of naproxen sodium orally; 40 received no block and 45 received a paracervical block before the cryosurgery procedure. After the procedure, a trained interviewer elicited pain and cramping scores using a visual analog scale. Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, Friedman's two-way analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance with covariates were used to analyze the data. RESULTS. Each part of the double- freeze cryosurgical procedure was ranked according to the participants' perceptions of pain and cramping. The cramping after the first freeze was significantly less for women receiving the paracervical block than for the women undergoing the usual procedure (z = -2.44, P=.014). Including the discomfort from the injection itself, the women who received a paracervical block perceived less cramping overall during cryosurgery than the women with no block (z=-2.35, P=.019). The paracervical block did not decrease the pain from cryosurgery according to the participants' rankings of perceived pain. CONCLUSIONS. A paracervical block is effective in reducing the cramping from cryosurgery.",English,0

A qualitative systematic review,10.1097/EJA.0b013e32834a0255,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Pain following craniotomy has been demonstrated to be frequent and moderate-to-severe in nature. In recent years, the focus on the challenges in treatment of postoperative pain following craniotomy has increased. Fear of using opioids because of their wide array of side-effects has led to the search for alternative analgesic options. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate current evidence about analgesic therapy following craniotomy. DATA SOURCES: PubMed database, Embase, Cochrane library, Google scholar and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) with pain or supplemental postoperative analgesic consumption as an endpoint were included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 34 RCTs were identified, and nine RCTs were included in the final analysis, with a total of 519 patients (251 control vs. 268 active treatment). Four treatment modalities - scalp infiltration (five RCTs), nerve scalp block (two RCTs), parecoxib (one RCT) and patient-controlled analgesia with morphine (one RCT) - were evaluated. Scalp infiltration with local anaesthetic may provide adequate analgesia in the first few postoperative hours, and nerve scalp block may provide longer lasting analgesia for about 6 h. Morphine was found to reduce total analgesic rescue doses with no significant effect on nausea and no other side-effects. No significant evidence was found to support the use of parecoxib in the treatment of postcraniotomy pain. CONCLUSION: No firm recommendations on analgesic therapy following craniotomy can be given because the number of well performed RCTs is limited and the study populations are very small. However, evidence on scalp infiltration suggests an analgesic effect in the first few postoperative hours. There is an urgent need for well performed RCTs on pain therapy following craniotomy.",eng,0

Our hypothesis is that use of paravertebral blocks (PVB) as the sole anesthetic technique will result in shorter time to achieve home readiness and improved same-day recovery over a 'fast-track' GA. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to receive either PVB or GA under standardized protocols (PVB = 0.75% ropivacaine, followed by propofol sedation; GA = dolasetron 12.5 mg, propofol induction, rocuronium, endotracheal intubation; desflurane; bupivacaine 0.25% for field block). Eligibility for postanesthetic care unit (PACU) bypass and data on time-to-postoperative pain, ambulation, home readiness, and incidence of adverse events were collected. More patients in the PVB group (71%) met the criteria to bypass the postanesthetic care unit compared with patients in the GA group (8%; P < 0.001). Only 3 (13%) of patients in the PVB group requested treatment for pain while in the hospital, compared with 12 (50%) patients in the GA group, despite infiltration with local anesthetic (P = 0.005). Patients in the PVB group were able to ambulate earlier (102 +/- 55 minutes) than those in the GA group (213 +/- 108 minutes; P < 0.001).

Adverse events (e.g., nausea, vomiting, sore throat) and pain requiring treatment in the first 24 hours occurred less frequently in patients who had received PVB than in those who had received GA. In outpatients undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy, PVB resulted in faster time to home readiness and was associated with fewer adverse events and better analgesia before discharge than GA.",eng,0

Controversy exists as to which method is more suitable in outpatients undergoing hand and wrist surgery. The authors hypothesized that infraclavicular brachial plexus block (INB) performed with a short-acting local anesthetic would result in shorter time to discharge home as compared with fast-track"" GA. METHODS: After obtaining written informed consent, 52 patients (aged 18-65 yr, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III) were randomly assigned to receive either an INB or GA under standardized protocols (INB = 3% 2-chloroprocaine + HCO3 + epinephrine 1:300000, followed by propofol sedation; GA = 12.5 mg dolasetron, propofol induction, followed by laryngeal mask airway insertion and desflurane for maintenance; 0.25% bupivacaine for wound infiltration). At the conclusion of the procedure, nurses blinded to the study goals and the anesthetic technique used a modified Aldrete score to decide whether patients could bypass the postanesthesia care unit. Additional data were collected regarding time to postoperative pain, ambulation, home readiness, and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: More patients in the INB group (79%) met the criteria to bypass the postanesthesia care unit compared with patients in the GA group (25%; P < 0.001). Compared with patients in the GA group, fewer patients in the INB group had pain (visual analog scale score > 3) on arrival to the postanesthesia care unit (3% vs. 43%; P < 0.001). None of the patients in the INB group requested treatment for pain while in the hospital, compared with 48% of patients in the GA group (P < 0.001). Patients in the INB group were able to ambulate earlier (82 +/- 41 min) compared with those in the GA group (145 +/- 70 min; P < 0.001). Time to home readiness and discharge times were shorter for patients in the INB group (100 +/- 44 and 121 +/- 37 min) compared with those in the GA group (203 +/- 91 and 218 +/- 93 min; P < 0.001). Adverse events (e.g., nausea, vomiting, sore throat) occurred less frequently in patients undergoing INB as compared with those undergoing GA.

Materials and Methods: 31 ASA I-III patients aged 60-90 undergoing hip fracture surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups as FICB(N=15) and remifentanil infusion(n=16). In Group FICB, ultrasound-guided FICB by using 30 ml of levobupivacaine 0.375% was performed, in Group R intravenous remifentanil at a rate of 0.15 mug/kg/min was infused before spinal anesthesia. In Group FICB, 20 minutes after the block and in Group R after obtaining a sedation score of 2, position was given for performing spinal anesthesia and position quality scores were assessed. Positional and postoperative pain were evaluated with VAS, VPS at rest, movement. Nausea-vomiting, additional analgesic requirement,motor blokade and quality of sleep were recorded. Results: Demographic data and duration of the operation were similiar in both groups. In Group R, blood pressure between 5-30 minutes were significantly lower than Group FICB. There was no significant difference in terms of postoperative pain and side effects. Conclusions: We suggest that ultrasound-guided FICB and remifentanil infusions are effective methods in preventing positional pain during spinal anesthesia but FICB is a safer method in patients requiring hemodynamic stability.",English,0

Combining local anaesthetics and opioids results in synergistic effects. The purpose of this randomized, prospective study was to compare quality of analgesia, side-effects and patient's satisfaction between spinal bupivacaine alone and epidural bupivacaine with sufentanil postoperatively. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients scheduled for hip arthroplasty were randomly assigned either to Group 1 receiving continuous spinal anaesthesia or Group 2 receiving continuous epidural anaesthesia. Postoperatively, those in Group 1 received a 1 mL bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 10 mL/24 h of bupivacaine 0.25 %. Those in Group 2 received a 5 mL bolus of lidocaine 2%, followed by a continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.25% with sufentanil 0.001 mg mL(-1) at 4 mL h(-1). Pain was measured using a verbal rating score and a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Group 1 and Group 2 of 43.3% and 37.9% reported complete analgesia on the verbal rating score. No statistically significant difference was found in the visual analogue scale. Nausea and vomiting occurred significantly more often in Group 2. The patient satisfaction rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous spinal analgesia with bupivacaine alone and continuous epidural analgesia with bupivacaine/sufentanil are both effective for postoperative pain relief after hip replacement. Those patients in the epidural group reported better analgesia but had a higher rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Efficacy of pain therapy did not correlate with patient satisfaction.",eng,0

Pace,2014.0,Neuraxial blockade for the prevention of postoperative mortality and major morbidity: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews,", http://ovidsp.ovid.com/athens?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=coch&AN=00075320-100000000-08452","Background, Various beneficial effects derived from neuraxial blocks have been reported. However, it is unclear whether these effects have an influence on perioperative mortality and major pulmonary/cardiovascular complications., Objectives, Our primary objective was to summarize Cochrane systematic reviews that assess the effects of neuraxial blockade on perioperative rates of death, chest infection and myocardial infarction by integrating the evidence from all such reviews that have compared neuraxial blockade with or without general anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia alone for different types of surgery in various populations. Our secondary objective was to summarize the evidence on adverse effects (an adverse event for which a causal relation between the intervention and the event is at least a reasonable possibility) of neuraxial blockade. Within the reviews, studies were selected using the same criteria., Methods, A search was performed in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on July 13, 2012. We have (1) included all Cochrane systematic reviews that examined participants of any age undergoing any type of surgical (open or endoscopic) procedure, (2) compared neuraxial blockade versus general anaesthesia alone for surgical anaesthesia or neuraxial blockade plus general anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia alone for surgical anaesthesia and (3) included death, chest infection, myocardial infarction and/or serious adverse events as outcomes. Neuraxial blockade could consist of epidural, caudal, spinal or combined spinal-epidural techniques administered as a bolus or by continuous infusion. Studies included in these reviews were selected on the basis of the same criteria. Reviews and studies were selected independently by two review authors, who independently performed data extraction when data differed from one of the selected reviews. Data were analysed by using Review Manager Version 5.1 and Comprehensive Meta Analysis Version 2.2.044., Main results, Nine Cochrane reviews were selected for this overview. Their scores on the Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire varied from four to six of a maximal possible score of seven. Compared with general anaesthesia, neuraxial blockade reduced the zero to 30-day mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 to 0.94; I(superscript 2) = 0%) based on 20 studies that included 3006 participants. Neuraxial blockade also decreased the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.79; I(superscript 2) = 0%) based on five studies that included 400 participants. No difference was detected in the risk of myocardial infarction between the two techniques (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.37; I(superscript 2) = 0%) based on six studies with 849 participants. Compared with general anaesthesia alone, the addition of a neuraxial block to general anaesthesia did not affect the zero to 30-day mortality (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.51; I(superscript 2) = 0%) based on 18 studies with 3228 participants. No difference was detected in the risk of myocardial infarction between combined neuraxial blockade-general anaesthesia and general anaesthesia alone (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09; I(superscript 2) = 0%) based on eight studies that included 1580 participants. The addition of a neuraxial block to general anaesthesia reduced the risk of pneumonia (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.98; I(superscript 2) = 9%) after adjustment for publication bias and based on nine studies that included 2433 participants. The quality of the evidence was judged as moderate for all six comparisons., Authors' conclusions, Compared with general anaesthesia, a central neuraxial block may reduce the zero to 30-day mortality for patients undergoing surgery with intermediate to high cardiac risk (level of evidence, moderate).

Terranova,2013.0,Role of regional analgesia techniques current evidence,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AAP.0b013e3182a6a39d,"Purpose/Objective: To evaluate regional anesthesia techniques widely used to manage acute postoperative pain, especially ultrasound-guided procedures, local infiltration analgesia and adjuvants, most studied innovations in latest literature. Materials and Methods: Article is based on non-systematic literature searches in PubMed databases in last three years. Results: We found nine randomized clinical trials involving 631 patients comparing US with peripheral nerve stimulators (PNS) performing different kinds of regional analgesia. US-assisted placement of stimulating catheter seems to improve success rate of peripheral blocks and patient satisfaction, allowing shorter procedural times and fewer complications. Results are not univocal in terms of postoperative pain control. We found 11 randomized clinical trials involving 577 patients evaluating LIA. Compared to epidural analgesia, LIA seems to provide better pain relief and reduce patientcontrolled opioids consumption. When compared to FNB, LIA shows equivalent analgesia. Studies comparing LIA with placebo show non univocal results. Finally, we went through use of adjuvants in association with local anesthetics: we found 18 randomized clinical trials involving 1515 patients. In most of cases, adjuvants showed more rapid onset of sensory and motor block, prolonged duration of sensory block, reduced postoperative analgesic consumption and pain scores. Conclusions: US are extensively used and may help in performing peripheral blocks with not yet clear efficacy in terms of decreasing postoperative pain. Further studies are necessary to define indication for local infiltration analgesia. New adjuvants showed good results when compared with placebo or intravenous administration. Further studies are necessary to make these techniques more standardized, with special attention to side effects and anaesthetic toxicity .",English,0

It has been shown to be effective in reducing morphine consumption and improving postoperative pain relief in several clinical settings. METHODS: We performed a randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing bilateral ultrasound-guided TAP blocks (2 x 20 mL 0.5% ropivacaine or 0.9% saline) in adult female patients undergoing midline laparotomy for known or presumed gynecological malignancy. Both groups received multimodal IV analgesia. The primary outcomes for the study were defined as the incidence of inadequate"" analgesia (defined as a score >50 mm on a visual analog scale) with forced expiration at 2 hours postoperatively and total postoperative morphine consumption at 2 hours and 24 hours. RESULTS: Data from 65 patients were included in the study. The groups were comparable in terms of age, weight, surgical duration, and intraoperative morphine doses. There were no significant differences between the control and treatment groups in the proportion of patients with inadequate analgesia either at rest (39% vs. 22%, P = 0.13) or with coughing (61% vs. 53%, P = 0.54) at 2 hours. There was no significant difference in postoperative morphine consumption between the placebo and treatment groups at 2 hours (13.5 mg vs. 11.87 mg, P = 0.53) or 24 hours (34.0 mg vs. 36.1 mg, P = 0.76). There were no significant differences in the incidence of opioid side effects or patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that TAP blockade conferred no benefit in addition to multimodal analgesia in women undergoing major gynecological cancer surgery.""",eng,1

The present study compared lidocaine to ropivacaine in intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) in infants. Methods: Thirty-six infants aged 10-24 months undergoing elective release of congenital club foot were randomized into 3 equal groups. Control group received general anaesthesia only, lidocaine group received 1 ml/kg of 0.3% lidocaine combined with general anaesthesia and ropivacaine group received 1 ml/kg ropivacaine 0.1% combined with general anaesthesia. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were recorded at baseline, before and after intubation, after tourniquet placement, at skin incision, every 10 minutes during the surgical procedure, after tourniquet deflation and after extubation. Results: Intraoperatively, children who received IVRA maintained haemodynamic stability, required no intraoperative narcotics and consumed less inhaled sevoflurane concentration. Times from recovery to the first rescue analgesic medication were 10 (3.83) minutes, 44.9 (9.41) minutes and 52.5 (3.53) minutes in the control, lidocaine and ropivacaine groups, respectively (P < 0.05). Similarly, patients in the control group showed higher OPS in the immediate postoperative period [4 (2-4)] than the lidocaine and ropivacaine groups [1.5 (0-2) and 1 (0-2), respectively). Conclusion: The current study concluded that IVRA combined with general anaesthesia reduced intraoperative analgesic and anaesthetic requirements and resulted in extended analgesia in the immediate postoperative period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 40 male patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia who underwent TURP, and they were divided randomly into two groups. All patients were operated under general anesthesia. The study group patients (n = 20) received periprostatic bupivacaine (0.5% 20 ml) injection (group I), and the control patients (n = 20) received only saline (NaCl 0.9% 20 ml) injection (group II). All injections were performed bilaterally into the periprostatic areas immediately after the TURP procedure via the transperineal route. In the postoperative period, all patients (groups I and II) received tramadol using a patient-controlled analgesia device. Postoperative pain was assessed and recorded using the visual analog scale (VAS) at postoperative hours 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 48.

Transvs abdominis plane (TAP) blocks have proven effective in controlling postoperative pain in a variety of laparoscopic abdominal surgeries. To date, no studies have focused on TAP blocks in LVHR. We set out to determine whether an intraoperative TAP block, administered under laparoscopic visualization, would decrease postoperative pain in LVHR. METHODS: A prospective randomized double blind control trial of 85 consecutive patients undergoing LVHR from 2012-2014 was conducted. Patients were randomized using the R program to receive a TAP block (bupivacaine 0.25%) (n = 45) or placebo (saline) (n = 40) injection. Under laparoscopic visualization, the lateral edge of the rectus was identified and either a weight-based dose of bupivacaine or saline was injected lateral to this. Analgesic usage was recorded up to 24 hours postoperatively. Pain scores in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) were assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (0-10). Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS v20. RESULTS: Patients who received the TAP block self-reported significantly less pain in the PACU than controls who received a placebo (p = 0.04) (Table 1). Patients who received the TAP block prior to mesh insertion used significantly less pain medication at 6 (p = 0.02), 12 (p = 0.008), 18 (p = 0.007), and 24 (p = 0.02) hours postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic TAP blocks given during LVHR significantly decreases both postoperative medication use and pain experienced by patients. We recommend administering intraoperative TAP blocks during LVHR for pain control. (Table Presented).",English,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of 41 patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery. The patients were divided into 2 groups: a group that received a fascia iliaca compartment block with 0.45% ropivacaine at a dosage of 0.3 mL/kg (maximum dose, 30 mL) and a control group in which no block was performed. Patients were enrolled consecutively as they entered the postanesthetic recovery unit. Postoperative pain was assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS) immediately after surgery and 24 hours later. Other variables recorded were opiate use for rescue analgesia and adverse effects due to the use of opiates. RESULTS: The VAS scores recorded in the postanesthetic recovery unit were significantly different in the 2 groups, with lower scores in the group receiving the fascia iliaca compartment block (P < .001). However, no significant between-group differences were observed in VAS scores recorded on the ward 24 hours after surgery (P = .57). CONCLUSIONS: A single-injection fascia iliaca compartment block was effective in controlling initial postoperative pain in a postanesthetic recovery unit. It was effective on the ward in the first few hours after surgery but not for the entire 24-hour period because of the limited duration of the block.",spa,0

OBJECTIVE: Pain and intra- and postoperative bleeding are problems associated with tonsillectomy/adenotonsillectomy. In order to make tonsillectomy/adenotonsillectomy better suited to outpatient surgery, solutions to these problems should be found. One possibility may be the combination of local and general anesthesia. The aim of this study was to find out if such a combination is beneficial in tonsillectomy/adenotonsillectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study on 64 adult (adeno)tonsillectomy patients to investigate the possible benefits of infiltrating the peritonsillar space with a BE solution. RESULTS: In the recovery room, the BE group experienced less pain than a control group infiltrated with saline; subsequently there was no significant difference between the groups concerning pain. The average volume of intraoperative bleeding and the operation time were significantly smaller in the BE group.

Kaushik,2009.0,Subtenon block compared to intravenous fentanyl for perioperative analgesia in pediatric cataract surgery,10.1213/ane.0b013e318198a3fd,"BACKGROUND: General anesthesia with opioids provides good operative conditions for ocular surgery in children; however, postoperative pain management remains a significant problem. Regional anesthesia is commonly used as an adjunct to general anesthesia in children. We compared the efficacy and safety of subtenon block (SB) versus IV fentanyl for perioperative analgesia in pediatric cataract surgery. We hypothesized that perioperative analgesia using SB may reduce the requirement of postoperative rescue analgesia compared with fentanyl. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial. One hundred fourteen ASA I and II children (6 mo-6 yr) undergoing elective cataract surgery in one eye under general anesthesia were studied. Children were randomly allocated to one of the two groups, i.e., Group SB (n = 58) or Group F (n = 56) after securing the airway. Children in Group SB received SB with 0.06-0.08 mL/kg of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine (50:50) mixture and simultaneous 0.2 mL/kg normal saline IV, whereas children in Group F received 1 microg/kg (0.2 mL/kg of 5 microg/kg) of fentanyl IV and simultaneous subtenon injection with normal saline (0.06-0.08 mL/kg). Surgery started after 5 min of study drug administration. Postoperative assessment for pain, sedation, and nausea/vomiting was done at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 h. The primary outcome was number of patients requiring rescue analgesia during the 24-h study period. Secondary outcomes assessed were pain and sedation scores, time to first rescue analgesia, incidence of occulocardiac reflex, and nausea/vomiting. RESULTS: The number of patients requiring rescue analgesia during the 24 h was significantly less in Group SB (n = 17/58, 29.3%) compared with Group F (n = 39/56, 69.6%, P < 0.001). The postoperative pain scores were statistically lower in Group SB at all time intervals. The median (range) time to first analgesic requirement was significantly prolonged in Group SB (9 [corrected] [2-13] vs 4 [0.5-8.5] h in Group F) (P < 0.001). Sedation scores at (1/2) h were comparable, after which significantly more children were anxious or crying in Group F compared with Group SB in which more children were calm, sitting, or lying with eyes open and relaxed (P < 0.05). A significantly higher incidence of oculocardiac reflex was recorded in Group F versus Group SB (P = 0.019). No complication related to SB was noticed. CONCLUSIONS: SB is a safe and superior alternative to IV fentanyl for perioperative analgesia in pediatric cataract surgery.",eng,1

Methods: The study included 140 patients. Of these, 72 were women and 68 were men. The mean age and weight of the patients were 33.67 + 10.2 years (range, 21-63 years) and 69.6 + 13.6 kg. The patients were divided randomly into four groups. Three of the four groups received one of the local anesthetics studied in our trial (lidocaine + adrenaline, 0.25% bupivacaine, or 2% prilocaine) before removal of the nasal packing material and the control group received saline solution. Local anesthetics and 0.9% saline solution were applied to Merocel nasal packs 15 minutes before removal. Each patient was given a questionnaire where verbal analog score and amount of postoperative hemorrhage was noted. Results: The mean pain score was 3.5 + 1.2 (median, 4; range, 3-5) in the lidocaine group, 4.5 + 1.2 (median, 4; range 3-5) in the prilocaine group, 4.7 + 1.3 (median, 6; range, 3-5) in the bupivacaine group, and 6.35 + 1.2 (median, 6; range, 5-7) in the saline group during nasal packing removal. The lidocaine group had significantly better pain scores versus other groups (p < 0.05). Bupivacaine and prilocaine had significantly better pain scores versus the control group, respectively. Analysis of bleeding scores after pack removal showed that all three study groups had significantly better bleeding scores versus the control saline group (p < 0.05). The lidocaine group had significantly less bleeding score than bupivacaine and prilocaine groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Topical lidocaine application before removal of nasal packs in patients who undergo nasal septal surgery can decrease discomfort and bleeding and improve patient tolerance.

Evaluation of pain control efficacy, need of additional analgesics, degree of motor block and side-effects. Methods: After receiving the approval from the local human ethics committee, the prospective, randomized, double-blind study was conducted. 34 ASA I or II class patients who underwent primary hip replacement surgery were enrolled. Spinal block was used for anesthesia. Patients were randomized into two groups: Epidural analgesia (EA) and lumbar plexus block (LPB). Patients of EA group received a continuous lumbar epidural infusion of Bupivacaine 0.125% and Fentanyl 0.05 mg/ml mixture at a rate of 3-5 ml/h. In the LPB group the lumbar plexus catheter was placed using posterior approach and patients received the same mixture of drugs at a rate of 5-10 ml/h. We evaluated these parameters on the surgery day (min. 6 hours after the operation) and on the 1st and 2nd day after the surgery: Pain intensity (visual analog scale, 0-10 points), degree of motor block (Bromage scale, 0-3 points), need of additional analgetics, side-effects (nausea, vomiting and itch). Results: There was no significant difference in patient demographics. The postoperative pain management was equally efficient in both groups, but additional analgesics were required more commonly in epidural analgesia group (29.4% vs. 5.9%). There were significantly more patients with complete motor block in LPB group (64.7% vs. 17.6%). The frequency of side-effects in both groups did not differ significantly. Conclusions: 1. The postoperative pain management was equally efficient in both groups, but additional analgesics were required more commonly in epidural analgesia group. 2.

Randomized bupivacaine and saline were administered by residents or nurses blind to syringes content, and their analgesic outcomes were evaluated according to Prince Henry's pain score by comparing pre and post bilateral pleural block values. As a function of postoperative pain, spirometric tests of pulmonary function were also applied via a portable spirometer. RESULTS: All bupivacaine patients referred postoperative analgesia with mean duration of 247.75 + 75 minutes although there has been mild residual pain in the suprapubic region of five patients (8%) and in the xiphoid apophysis in two patients (3.2%). No analgesic effect was obtained with saline,. Pulmonary function evaluated pre and post-blockade were improved with bupivacaine in FVC (p < 0.0367) and FEV1 (p < 0.0051). No improvement was seen in EFP (p < 0.059) and FEV1/FVC ratio (p < 0.1263). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, postoperative pain control with bilateral pleural block after urgency median laparotomies was null with saline. With bupivacaine, however, analgesia was not considered fully effective in all patients during movements on bed and deep breathing. Pleural block does not seem to have the same analgesic outcome for all patients.",English Portuguese,0

Methods: After approval of Faculty Ethical Commitee and patient consent, aged 20-70, ASA I-II, 100 patients who are undergoing laminectomy were included. Patients randomly divided into two groups: Group I patients were received 0.1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> iv. boluse mophine 20 minutes before the end of operation and iv. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine (demand dose 0.02 mg/kg, 20 min lockout time) was started after the operation. Group II patients who are placed prone position after intubation, bilateral paravetrebral somatic block was performed with 5 mL levobupivacaine 0.5% for each nerve to upper dermatome of laminectomy level. Intravenous PCA morphine was started after the end of operation. All patients were received 8 mg ondansetron. Postoperative systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, SpO<sub>2</sub> values, pain (VAS) scores, total morphine consumption, and side effects were recorded. Results: Demographic data, operation times, and hemodynamic parameters of groups were similar. VAS scores were higher in group I than group II on postoperative 4, 6, 12 hours (P < 0.05). Total morphine consumption was significantly lower in group II (11.88 + 7.28 mg) than group I (29.46 + 9.34 mg) for 24 hours (P < 0.05).

Postoperative benefits may include a decrease in pain, in analgesic requirements, and in the incidence of nausea and vomiting. The authors examined the potential benefits of a skull block in patients in whom a maintenance anesthetic consisting of sevoflurane and a titratable remifentanil infusion was used. In other studies examining the ability of a skull block to improve perioperative outcomes, investigators have not used remifentanil. METHODS: Thirty patients presenting for resection of a supratentorial tumor were prospectively enrolled. Patients were randomized into 2 groups as follows: 14 patients (skull block group) received a skull block with 0.5% ropivacaine at least 15 minutes prior to pinning, whereas the remaining 16 patients (control group) did not. RESULTS: Patients in the skull block group did not have a significant increase in blood pressure or heart rate with placement of head pins, whereas patients in the control group did. Nevertheless, there was no difference in blood pressure variability between the groups. The mean intraoperative concentration of sevoflurane (1.0% in both groups, p = 0.703) and remifentanil (0.163 microg/kg/min compared with 0.205 microg/kg/min, p = 0.186) used was similar in both groups. During the postoperative period, there was no difference in the 1-, 2-, or 4-hour visual analog scale scores; in the need for postoperative narcotic analgesia (0.274 morphine equivalent mg/kg compared with 0.517 morphine equivalent mg/kg, p = 0.162); or in the incidence of nausea or vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective analysis of perioperative skull blockade failed to demonstrate significant benefit in patients treated with a remifentanil infusion.""",eng,0

Bond,2012.0,Paravertebral blockade for day-case breast augmentation: a randomized clinical trial,10.1213/ANE.0b013e318264ba33,"BACKGROUND: Bilateral breast augmentation is an increasingly popular day-case procedure. Local infiltration with sedation is routinely used for its ease of application compared with the more complex and potentially riskier paravertebral blockade (PVB). We hypothesized that ropivacaine injected by experienced anesthesia providers into the paravertebral space as a PVB was more effective than ropivacaine injected by the operating surgeon (plastic surgeon) directly into the zone of surgical dissection. METHODS: Forty female patients who were ASA physical status I or II and undergoing bilateral subpectoral cosmetic breast augmentation were recruited for participation in a prospective, randomized, single-blind study. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: ropivacaine via PVB, or surgical infiltration of ropivacaine. In both groups, the surgeon was asked to infiltrate the appropriate area with either saline (PVB group) or ropivacaine (local infiltration group). Both groups were sedated with propofol, titrated to effect. The plastic surgeon was blinded to the solution injected. Data collected included demographic characteristics, intraoperative cooperation scores, recovery room postoperative nausea and vomiting, analgesia use, and visual analog scale pain scores. All patients were asked to complete a preoperative anxiety and quality of recovery questionnaire and to record their pain scores and analgesia requirements on discharge. The outcome measures were (i) intraoperative patient cooperation as assessed by the plastic surgeon, (ii) propofol requirement, (iii) postoperative pain, and (iv) quality of recovery. RESULTS: Forty patients completed the study. PVB improved intraoperative cooperation (significance of difference P < 0.001, WMWodds = 6.69 with 95% 1-sided confidence interval CI >/=2.85), reduced propofol requirement (significance of difference P = 0.005, WMWodds = 0.35, CI <0.69), and decreased average postoperative pain in the home environment (significance of difference P = 0.007, WMWodds = 0.38, CI <0.73). There were no PVB complications. Only patients from the surgical infiltration group required rescue analgesics (30%, significance of difference = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In a limited number of patients, we found that PVB is superior to direct surgical infiltration of ropivacaine for bilateral breast augmentation in same-day surgery. These advantages need to be balanced against the potential risks of PVB, especially in an office setting.",eng,1

The aim of this trial was to compare postoperative analgesia from a fascia iliaca compartment block to continuous epidural analgesia following knee arthroplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical trial enrolling patients in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classes 1 to 3 randomized to 2 groups. One group received spinal anesthesia plus a fascia iliaca compartment block with 0.1% bupivacaine at a rate of 10 mL/h. The second group received combined spinal-epidural anesthesia plus epidural analgesia with 0.1% bupivacaine in continuous infusion at a rate of 8 mL/h. Postoperative pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and on movement was recorded every 3 hours for the first 24 hours. Use of intravenous morphine and the adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS: Forty patients (20 for each group) were enrolled. The distribution of age, weight, body mass index, sex, ASA class, duration of surgery, use of morphine, and the incidence of adverse effects were similar in the 2 groups. Postoperative VAS scores at rest and on movement were also similar. The incidence of arterial hypotension was higher in the epidural analgesia group. CONCLUSIONS: The fascia iliaca compartment block and continuous epidural infusion are similarly efficient in providing postoperative analgesia for patients after total knee replacement. The fascia iliaca compartment block is associated with a lower incidence of postoperative hemodynamic complications. Early, safe rehabilitation is facilitated by both analgesic techniques.",spa,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive patients with internal derangements of the TMJ and persistent pain underwent TMJ arthroscopy. The patients were randomized equally into 4 groups. Group 1 received a sterile saline solution (control), group 2 received bupivacaine alone, group 3 received only a morphine solution, and group 4 received morphine mixed with bupivacaine. The patients recorded postarthroscopy pain using a visual analog scale (VAS), as well as analgesic consumption for 24 hours. The VAS and analgesic consumption were compared in the 4 groups. RESULTS: Group 3 (bupivacaine alone) consumed, on average, 5.1 fewer analgesic equivalents than did group 1 (control) over the 24-hour period of study (P <.05). Otherwise, there was no significant difference in the number of analgesic equivalents consumed by the 4 groups. Patients treated with bupivacaine alone and those with morphine alone had significantly lower pain scores than the controls. However, there was no significant difference between the pain scores of the morphine and bupivacaine groups at any time. Patients treated with the mixture of morphine and bupivacaine showed no significant difference from controls at any time. CONCLUSIONS: Bupivacaine alone provides a better analgesic effect than morphine alone or the combination of morphine and bupivacaine. Morphine alone has a longer time of onset, with less effect on the pain scores during the 24-hour observation period.",eng,0

DESIGN: Literature review and analysis. METHOD: The authors performed a systematic search of the literature to identify all articles pertaining to regional anesthesia during cataract surgery on adults. One investigator abstracted the content of each article onto a custom-designed form. A second investigator corroborated the findings. The evidence supporting the anesthesia approaches was graded by consensus as good, fair, poor, or insufficient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence supporting the effectiveness of different forms of regional anesthesia. RESULTS: There was good evidence that retrobulbar and peribulbar blocks provide equivalent akinesia and pain control during cataract surgery. Additionally, sub-Tenon's blocks were at least as effective as retrobulbar and peribulbar blocks. There was good evidence that retrobulbar block provides better pain control during surgery than topical anesthesia, and there was fair evidence that peribulbar block provides better pain control than topical anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: This synthesis of the literature demonstrates that currently used approaches to anesthesia management provide adequate pain control for successful cataract surgery, but there is some variation in the effectiveness of the most commonly used techniques. Data are needed on patient preferences to determine the optimal strategies for anesthesia management during cataract surgery.",eng,1

Previous studies showed decreased opioid consumption and slightly shorter length of stay after single TAP injection in the patients undergoing laparoscopic colon resection (1,2). This retrospective review assessed the impact of continuous TAP catheter on postoperative opioid consumption and recovery after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Methods: A total of 27 patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery at Stamford Hospital between October 2010 and October 2011 were compared (see Table1). The patients were treated postoperatively either with PCA alone or with TAP catheters in addition to the PCA. Bilateral TAP catheters were placed after induction of general anesthesia in a supine position under the US-guidance as described previously (3). A bolus of 20 cc of 0.5% ropivacaine was injected via the needle on each side prior to catheter placement. Postoperatively, the catheters were attached to a portable infusion pump (ONQ C-bloc; I-Flow, Lake Forest, CA). A continuous infusion with 0.2% ropivacaine at 5-7 cc/hr/side was initiated in the PACU and continued for 3 days postoperatively. Primary outcomes were postop opioid requirements and length of stay. 1st day of flatus and 1st day of stool were also examined. 1 mg Dilaudid was noted to be equivalent to 7 mg morphine for comparison purposes. Continuous data was compared using the Student t-test. Results: TAP group used less opioids each day over the first three days. The patients within the TAP group tended to pass flatus earlier, and were found to pass stool and be discharged earlier than the PCA group, p>0.05(see Table 2). Conclusions: This retrospective pilot study demonstrates that the addition of a TAP catheter block to a PCA postoperatively in laparoscopic colectomy patients leads to decreased opioid use, earlier passage of stool, and shorter length of stay. Given the compelling nature of the results in this study, a prospective, randomized controlled study is currently under IRB review to further evaluate the value of TAP catheters in improving overall post-operative patient outcomes in laparoscopic colon resections.(Figure Presented).",English,0

Considerations relate to the patients premorbid condition, impaired renal excretory function, uremic bleeding diasthesis and the desire to avoid hypotension that may compromise the return of graft function. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is associated with reduced opioid requirements and pain scores for procedures involving the lower abdominal wall [1]. This study assessed TAP block efficacy (landmark technique) in patients following cadaveric renal transplantation. Methods: Following local ethics committee approval and written informed consent, this prospective study randomized 65 adult renal transplant recipients to receive a standardized general anesthetic technique supplemented with levobupivacaine 0.375% 20ml TAP block (TAP group) or sham block with 20ml 0.9% saline (control group). Both groups received intravenous acetaminophen 1g, morphine 0.1 mg kg-1 and ondansetron 4mg intraoperatively, and patient controlled morphine analgesia with regular acetaminophen in the postoperative period. Patient assessment occurred in the post anesthetic care unit and at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours. The primary outcome was total morphine consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, nausea and/or vomiting, sedation and respiratory depression. Continuous variables were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. Multiple regression analysis was used to calculate morphine requirements and logistic regression was used for analysis of binary endpoints. Results: 32 patients were randomized to the TAP group and 33 to the control group. Morphine requirements did not differ between the 2 groups, 31.6 + 5.6 mg in the TAP group and 32.6 + 5.5 mg in the control group, [ 95% CI (-8.96 to 7.09, p=0.817). Pain scores also did not differ significantly at any time point following surgery. Nausea and vomiting rates were increased in the TAP group 53% and 22% respectively compared with 24% and 6% in the control group. No patient exhibited excessive sedation or respiratory depression. Conclusion: The addition of a TAP block using the landmark technique to the analgesia regimen for cadaveric renal transplantation did not confer any additional benefit on opioid requirements or pain scores in the first 24 hours postoperatively.",English,0

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the efficacy of systemic analgesia, continuous wound catheter (CWC) analgesia and thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) for pain management after thoracotomy, assessed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score and morphine consumption. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised study. SETTING: University teaching hospital. Inclusions from April 2007 to February 2010. PATIENTS: 153 adult patients scheduled for pulmonary surgery. INTERVENTIONS: All three groups received systemic analgesia with paracetamol and morphine (patient-controlled analgesia, PCA). The PCA group received systemic analgesia only. The TPVB group underwent insertion of a paravertebral catheter and the CWC group underwent CWC catheter insertion at the end of the intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain score at rest as assessed by VAS. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three patients were included, of whom 140 were included in the final analysis (50 PCA, 44 TPVB, 46 CWC). Baseline and surgical characteristics were comparable in the three groups. VAS scores were statistically different between the TPVB and PCA groups at rest (at 0, 1, 3, 6 h; P < 0.0026) and after coughing (0, 1, 3, 6, 12 h; P < 0.003). In recovery room care, titrated morphine doses were significantly lower (P = 0.00001) in the TPVB group than in the other two.

There was no difference between CWC and PCA groups in terms of VAS scores or morphine consumption. No signs of toxicity or local complications were observed. CONCLUSION: Our results support the efficacy of TPVB for pain management after thoracotomy, at rest and after coughing. These results confirm the preference for TPVB over epidural analgesia in postthoracotomy pain care. CWC failed to decrease pain and morphine consumption and performed no better than placebo.",eng,0

Despite numerous studies reporting effective postoperative analgesia in the adult population, only a few studies have been published in paediatrics (2). With the utilization of ultrasound (US) guidance for regional anaesthesia, this block has been reported as effective and safe in providing postoperative analgesia following abdominal surgery in children (3). With this study we compared TAP block to conventional caudal block for postoperative analgesia after minor abdominal surgery in children. Methods: After approval from the hospital ethics committee and written informed consent, we enrolled seventy paediatric patients undergoing elective day-case minor abdominal surgery. Inclusion criteria were age between 1 and 8 years and ASA 1-2 status. Patients with history of adverse reaction to local anaesthetics, coagulation or neurological disorders were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to receive, after induction of general anaesthesia, preincisional US-guided TAP block (umbilical plane at anterior axillary line) with 0.2 ml kg <sup>-1</sup> ropivacaine 0.2% or preincisional caudal block with 1 ml kg <sup>-1</sup> ropivacaine 0.2%. Supplemental intraoperative analgesia consisted of fentanyl 3 mug kg <sup>-1</sup> at induction, and as-requested remifentanil. Postoperative analgesic therapy consisted of iv paracetamol 10 mg kg <sup>-1</sup> when age-appropriate pain score, assessed in the recovery room and in the day-surgery unit, was higher than 4. Patients were also assessed 24 h after surgery by phone interview for analgesic consumption and parental satisfaction. Results: Fifty-seven patients were included in the study: twenty-nine received TAP block and twenty-eight caudal block. Demographic variables were similar in the two groups. Fifteen patient receiving TAP block and ten receiving caudal block required iv paracetamol in recovery room or day-surgery unit. Mean time from block execution to first paracetamol administration was 370 min in TAP group and 457 min in caudal group. One patient in TAP group, who had surgery for bilateral inguinal hernia repair, required a second dose of paracetamol in day-surgery unit and a supplemental dose of oral paracetamol at home. There were no complications in both groups. Discussion: Data shows minor analgesia duration and a higher request of paracetamol in patients receiving TAP block. The results of our study suggest that caudal block is a better option than TAP block in providing postoperative analgesia after minor abdominal surgery in children. However, TAP block can be considered a valid alternative, especially in case of contraindications to neuroaxial blocks. Moreover, US guidance in performing TAP block decrease the possibility of intraperitoneal needle placement, and permit the use of significantly lower doses of local anaesthetic, thus reducing the risk of toxicity, especially in low-weight patients.",English,0

Recent reviews conclude that paravertebral (PVB) analgesia allows superior respiratory function following thoracotomy. We compared PVB and epidural analgeisa in patients presenting for elective open renal surgery in a randomized controlled, single blinded clinical trial Methods: Following written informed consent, 51 patients presenting for open renal surgery were randomized to receive either epidural analgesia, (n = 25) or PVB analgesia with PCA morphine (n = 26). All patients received a standard general anaesthetic and regular paracetamol postoperatively. A blinded postoperative investigator assessed each patient at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. Blood was collected perioperatively compare stress response to surgery. Results: Epidural blockade reduced postoperative VAS scores at rest significantly at 1, 2, and 4 hours, (p < 0.05), at 6 hours (p = 0.01) and 12 hours (p < 0.001). Epidural blockade reduced postoperative VAS scores on movement significantly over the first 48 hours.

Methods: In one trial, 34 subjects were randomly allocated to double blindedly receive an active [N = 19] or sham [N = 15] stellate ganglion block on the surgical side after induction of general anesthesia. Analgesic use was compared during the first 3 postoperative days. In another trial, 26 subjects received either general anesthesia [N = 14] or regional anesthesia [N = 12] by random assignment. Analgesic use and pain scores were compared for the first 3 postoperative days and at postoperative weeks 2 and 4. Results: The groups to be compared in each trial were similar with regard to age, gender, duration of intraoperative tourniquet inflation, and type of surgery performed. Subjects receiving regional anesthesia tended to use less postoperative analgesics during the first two postoperative days [P =.08] than patients who underwent a general anesthetic but the difference was not statistically significant. These observations are discussed in light of present theories of neural sensitization and implications for clinical care.",English,1

Congahan,2012.0,Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks-a review,10.1016/j.surge.2012.07.005,"INTRODUCTION: Effective post-operative pain management can positively influence patient outcome. Multimodal analgesic regimes are often limited by side-effects. Epidural analgesia may be resource-consuming, restrict mobility and have negative cardiovascular and gastrointestinal consequences. Consequently, there is a need for regional anaesthetic techniques to minimise opioid use, and provide alternatives to epidurals, especially within the context of minimally invasive abdominal surgery and enhanced recovery programmes. This review aims to evaluate the evidence base underlying Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blockade. METHODS: A literature search was performed using the PubMed database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) using the parameters 'transversus abdominis plane' and 'TAP'. The references within were then searched for applicable studies. Case reports and correspondence were excluded. FINDINGS: Thirteen studies assessed technique and mechanisms of action. Fourteen clinical studies involved a total of 1250 patients. Seven studies (6 Randomised Controlled Trials, RCTs) demonstrated reductions in post-operative morphine requirements (33.3%-73.1%). Five RCTs demonstrated concomitant improvements in pain scores. Five RCTs demonstrated reduced opioid side effects. The one study assessing functional outcome (a Prospective Controlled Trial, PCT) demonstrated earlier return of gastrointestinal function and hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: The limited evidence to date suggests that TAP blockade is an effective adjunct to multimodal post-operative analgesia following a range of abdominal surgical procedures. Whether TAP blocks are a viable alternative to epidural analgesia remains to be determined. However, it is likely that as this technique grows in popularity its role, particularly that in enhanced recovery programmes, will be better delineated and refined.",eng,1
Journal Article,F. Festini; D. Dini; C. Neri; S. Neri,2008.0,[Control of postoperative pain in children undergoing hypospadias surgery: quasi-experimental controlled trial],", ","BACKGROUND: Hypospadias is one of the most common congenital anomalies occurring in approximately (1/300) male births. If it is not surgically corrected the consequences may negatively impact on quality of life in adolescents. The surgery is very invasive and the post-operative phase very painful. To improve the control of post-operative pain, continuous analgesia via epidural catheter was implemented. AIMS: To compare the effectiveness in controlling pain of two different regimens: continuous epidural catheter infusion vs oral and rectal non-steroidal pain-killers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative study on children undergoing hypospadias surgery. Group A (catheter) was treated with continuous postoperative analgesia via epidural catheter and Group B (scheduled times) with rectal and oral analgesics at scheduled times and on demand, after caudal block. In both groups nurses measured pain with VAS and FLACC scales (score from 0 to 10) for 72 hours after surgery. RESULTS: 41 children were studied (average age 64.1 months, SD 47.3), with 332 post-operative pain recordings (Group A n = 161, Group B n = 171). Mean pain score of Group A was 0.13 (SD 0.3) and 0.45 (SD 0.8) in group B, p = 0.006. The median duration of the epidural catheter was 65 hours, mean 51.8 hours (SD 24.3). During the 1st post-operative medication, the mean pain score in Group A was 1.2 (SD 1.4), and 3.2 (SD 1.8) in group B, p = 0.003. In group A the number of pain scores indicating pain (> 0) where 3.1% while in group B were 10.5%, p = 0.0007. CONCLUSIONS: In children undergoing hypospadias surgery, post-operative analgesia with continuous epidural catheter infusion seems to offer a better analgesic coverage than the traditional oral/rectal analgesic treatment at scheduled times and on demand.",ita,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to 2 groups of 20 each to receive either the conventional oral analgesia prescribed by our team after outpatient surgery (metamizole 575 mg/6 h p.o.) or perineural analgesia with a continuous infusion of 5 mL x h(-1) of 0.375% ropivacaine in the posterior tibial nerve. Surgery was performed under hyperbaric spinal anesthesia with mepivacaine and an injection of 0.25% bupivacaine into the joint. Both groups also received 50 mg/8 h p.o. of tramadol as rescue analgesia. Assessment during visits by the home care team 12, 24, and 48 hours after surgery included the following variables: pain on a visual analog scale (VAS, 0-10), sleep quality, need for rescue analgesia, acceptance of the technique, side effects and adverse events. Descriptive statistics were calculated and comparisons were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test; sleep quality and need for rescue analgesia were compared by applying the chi2 statistic with a test of linear trend. RESULTS: The perineural analgesia group had significantly lower VAS scores at 4, 12, and 24 hours and less need for rescue analgesia. No differences in sleep quality were found (P0.07). The incidence of side effects did not differ, and there were no readmissions. The patients expressed a high level of acceptance of the technique. CONCLUSION: Continuous perineural analgesia in the home setting was found to be effective and safe in our patients.",spa,0

The most critical aspect of awake craniotomy is to maintain adequate patient comfort, analgesia, immobility and cooperation during a long surgical operation, ensuring in the meanwhile the safety, control and maintenance of vital functions. The aim of this study was to compare awake craniotomy using conscious sedation technique versus conventional general anaesthesia for excision of low grade glioma encroaching on eloquent brain regarding anesthetic and neurological complications, patients' and surgeons' satisfaction, hemodynamic responses, hospital stay and the need for ICU admission. Methods: Forty two patients ASA I-II, aged 23-55 y harboring low grade glioma encroaching on eloquent brain were included in this study. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Patients in group 1 received general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation. Patients in the awake group had a scalp nerve block bilaterally, and local anesthetic infiltration at the site of skin incision and the sites of pin insertion. Each site was infiltrated with 2-3 ml of a mixture of bupivacaine 0.25%, lidocaine 1% and adrenaline 1:200,000 at each site. Local anaesthesia infiltration and arterial cannulation were done after IV injection of propofol (40-50 mg) and fentanyl (25 mug). After careful positioning, propofol infusion (1-2 mg/kg/h) and fentanyl (0.5 mug/kg/h) using two separate syringe pumps connected to two separate cannulae. Respiratory events (apnea, airway obstruction, O2 desaturation and hypercarbia), intracranial pressure (ICP), seizures, neurological deficits, duration of hospital stay and ICU admission were recorded for both groups. Results: Forty two patients completed the study. Two patients were excluded from the study because of excessive bleeding and failure to regain consciousness. The demographic data of patients in the two groups were comparable. None of the patients in the awake group received general anaesthesia. Two patients in the awake group developed intraoperative agitation that was controlled by an extra-sedative dose and five patients were over-sedated. Despite that fourteen patients, in the awake group, experienced intraoperative pain, it was severe in two patients that required more local anesthetic infiltration. None of the awake patients develop intraoperative nausea or vomiting while four patients in the GA group did. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). Two patients in the awake group developed intraoperative focal seizures and none of the patients had manifestations of local anaesthetic toxicity. Four patients in the awake group had subjective increased intracranial tension (tense brain) as compared to six patents in the general anaesthesia group. The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.46). Postoperative ICU admission was higher in patients in the general anaesthesia group than in patients in the awake group (fourteen and two patients respectively). The difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Only two patients in the awake group developed postoperative neurological dysfunction. As compared with twelve patients the general anaesthesia group, the difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). The mean duration of hospital stay was 3.8 + 4.15 days in the awake group. It was 8.15 + 6.5 days in the general anaesthesia group. The difference was statistically significant (p=0. 05). Conclusion: Awake craniotomy is a relatively simple procedure that does not require sophisticated technology that allows tumor removal guided by physiology rather than anatomy. Awake craniotomy has acceptable and easy manageable complications. We believe that it can be applied to any tumor other than gliomas as long as eloquent areas are concerned.",English,0

In 2008 the technique was offered to perform of hypochondrium oblique block of the TAP using ultrasound [1, 2]. We evaluated its analgesic efficacy in patients during the first 24 hours perioperative period of anterior/anterolateral retroperitoneal lumbar surgery in a randomized, controlled, clinical trial. Material and methods: The study included 60 patients (women-22 men-18, age-19-45 years, ASA I-II). The following spine surgeries were performed: anterior or anterolateral retroperitoneal approaches for spinal fusion L4-5 (12 of them-graft from the iliac bone, 38-mesh, 10-vertebral body prosthesis). All patients were randomly divided into two groups: Group T (n=30) had TAP-block and endotracheal anesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanil during surgery and Group G (n=30) had general anesthesia with sevoflurane and fentanil and then systemic administration of opioids after surgery. After induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation patients in Group T were underwent unilateral TAP-block 0.5% solution of 25 ml of ropivacaine after aspirate under ultrasound control (SonoScape, China) on the mid-axillary line, between the iliac crest and the costal margin. Before incision, patients in Group T received fentanyl 1 mcg/kg and then were entered it when necessary. At the end of the surgery after the closure of the wound the catheter was placed into the TAP under ultrasound and 5 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine solution was injected. After surgery patients in Group T were administered boluses of 20 ml of ropivacaine 0.2% solution, 2 times a day for 3 days. After surgery patients in both groups were administered ketorolac IM, 2 times a day for 3 days. Demographics, pain at rest and in motion, nausea and vomiting were assessed during the first 24 hours after surgery. Results: Patients with TAP-block needed for additional administration of narcotic analgesic occurred for longer times. 14 patients in Group T (47%) did not need for opioids. In the Group T there was significantly less pain at rest and in motion, and higher patient satisfaction. In comparison with Group G, cases of nausea and vomiting were significantly less in patients of Group T. There was no pain in 12 patients in Group T (40%) during the first 24 hours. Discussion: We conclude that using the TAP-block with ropivacaine as a component of anesthesia in anterior/anterolateral retroperitoneal lumbar surgery provides better analgesia reduces the intensity of pain after surgery, the need for opioids, improves postoperative patient comfort, and patient satisfaction. The TAP-block is and effective regional component combined general anesthesia. It is easily and safely to perform under ultrasound control.",English,0

The adductor canal block (ACB) is an almost exclusively sensory nerve block that has been demonstrated to reduce pain and opioid consumption after major knee surgery. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the analgesic effect of ACB in patients receiving a basic analgesic regimen of paracetamol and ibuprofen after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction under general anaesthesia. DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups. SETTING: Day Case Surgery, University of Copenhagen, Glostrup Hospital, Denmark, June 2010 to March 2012. PATIENTS: Fifty patients, aged 18 to 70 years, scheduled for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to receive ACB with either 30 ml ropivacaine 7.5 mg ml (n = 25) or 30 ml 0.9% saline (n = 24). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was pain score (0 to 100 mm) during standing at 2 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes were pain at rest, during standing and after walking 5 m, opioid consumption and opioid-related side effects for 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) pain scores for the primary outcome were 20 (12 to 36) mm in the ropivacaine and 20 (10 to 44) mm in the control group (P = 0.84, 95% confidence interval for difference of -9 to 12 mm). No significant differences were observed in any of the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: An analgesic regimen with paracetamol and ibuprofen provides acceptable postoperative pain control after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction.

In patients who received continuous bupivacaine infusion, the requirement for intramuscular opiate and rectal diclofenac was less, the score on a visual linear analogue pain scale lower and recovery of pulmonary function more rapid than in saline-infused controls. Postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in 35% of the saline group, but only 10% of the patients with bupivacaine infusion (p < 0.01). In patients with chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD), the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was 54.5% in the saline group and only 4.5% in the bupivacaine group (p < 0.01). Among the patients without COAD there was no significant intergroup difference in such complications.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of ultrasonography-guided TAP block in pediatric patients undergoing major abdominal surgeries in augmenting intraoperative analgesia and improving postoperative pain control during the first 24 hours. Patient and Methods: A prospective randomized, controlled, blind trial encountered thirty pediatric patients undergoing major abdominal surgery for different intra-abdominal malignancies via abdominal incision. Patients were allocated randomly into two groups (n - 15), received standard care (control group), including fentanyl intraoperative, bolus morphine and paracetamol analgesia in the postoperative period and (n - 15) undergone ultrasonography-guided TAP block in addition to standard care (TAP group). Intraoperative analgesia, intensity of pain, nausea, and sedation were assessed regularly by anesthesia research fellow who was blinded to group allocation in the postanesthesia care unit and at, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hrs postoperatively. Results: fentanyl consumption was significantly less in the TAP group. In addition, the TAP group showed decreased postoperative morphine requirements in respect to both the number of children who received morphine (5 v 14 patients), and the cumulative dose of morphine given. In patients who received the TAP block, postoperative sedation scores were reduced at 4, 6, 8 h postoperatively, but not at the other time points assessed. The incidence of PONV was reduced by more than half (67% vs. 20%) in TAP block group than control group. Perioperative analgesia provided by TAP block was considered excellent for all patients. There were no complications attributable to the TAP block. All TAP children and their parents reported high levels of satisfaction with their postoperative analgesic regimen.

Experience from Saudi Arabia,", http://ovidsp.ovid.com/athens?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=cctr&AN=CN-00830654","Introduction: Sleeve gasterectomy commonly done through 5-7 small incisions through which the ports inserted.Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is advanced minimal invasive surgical procedure in which the surgeon operate almost exclusively through a single entry point, typically the patient naval. Postoperative pain is a major concern can cause significant serious complications. Currently, at our institute King Fahd Military Medical Complex, the most common regimen for pain control in bariatric surgery performed under general anesthesia has been surgeon administered levobupivacaine local anesthetic infiltration in the wound before skin incision, followed by opioids in the Postanesthesia time, Ultrasound-guided regional techniques offer a number of advantages including real-time needle guidance and observation of local anesthetic spread within posterior sheath of the rectus muscle containing the peripheral nerves that innervate the abdomen. This is the first study that evaluates the role of rectus sheath block in morbid obese patients undergoing Single Incision Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy, and it's effects in the post operative pain. Methods: After informed consent and ethical committee approval 30 patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Patients were divided into two groups and the anesthetic management was standardized. Group I (Ultrasound guided rectus sheath block) bilateral ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block was performed by the anesthesiologist. Ultrasound is used to guide the deposition of levobupivacaine 0.5% 2 mg/kg in the posterior sheath of the rectus muscle. Group II (Wound infiltration) where wound infiltration using Levobupivacaine 0.5% 2 mg/kg is injected at the site of incision was performed by the surgeon. We collected the required data by reviewing the patient's files and their medication cards. Results: Total morphine consumption was 26.67+/-7.24 in group I while it was 33.33+/-4.88 with II (p=0.0063). Regarding Paracetamol consumption, it was 3.00+/-0.85 in group I but it was 3.67+/-0.72 in group II (p=0.0278). There was no difference in use of rescue antiemetic between the 2 groups (p=0.0570). No complications from the rectus sheath block were reported. Conclusion: The ultrasound rectus sheath block is an easy block to do. It was effective and superior for controlling the somatic abdominal wall pain than blind wound infiltration in patients undergoing Single Incision Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy. It decreased the total analgesic requirements especially the opioids. The visceral pain from the operative bed still required analgesia in the early postoperative. This pilot study shows encouraging results for further investigations. However, randomized, controlled trials are required to determine the real advantages of this technique in comparison with standard laparoscopy",,0

In this manuscript we compared the efficacy of three different techniques for postoperative pain treatment following TS. Methods: 30 patients scheduled to undergo TS under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into 3 groups (each 10 patients) according to pain relief modality used postoperatively. Group A; patients received ultrasound guided thoracic paravertebral block (USGTPV) with bupivacaine 0.5%, 10cc bolus and continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.0625%, 4-6ml/hr. Group B; patients received patient controlled i.v. Analgesia (PCA) with morphine lmg/ml with lock out time of 6 min postoperatively. Also PCA morphine was prescribed with the same settings in group A. Group C; patients received interpleural spray of 0.5% bupivacaine (20ml) at the end of surgery followed by PCA morphine at same setting for groups A and B. Numeric rating score (NRS) at 7 different intervals was used for pain assessment. Total dosages of morphine used in the first 24hr postoperatively were recorded. Non-Parametric Kruskal-Wallis Test and Mann-Whitney Test were used for comparisons within each group where P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Results: The median values (range) of NRS at rest were 1.5 (0-30), 4 (3-5) and 2 (1-4) for groups A, B and C respectively with significant differences (P< 0.05).

Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded after induction of anesthesia, at skull-pin insertion, at skin incision, at bone flap elevation, at dural incision, at dural closure, at skin closure, on admission to postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and every 1 h for 6 hours after admission. ICP was measured at the above-mentioned time points. Time to recovery from anesthesia was also recorded. Visual analog pain scores were recorded every 1 h for 6 hours in the PACU. Results: MAP and HR showed significant differences between-groups except at many points of measurements where fentanyl had higher MAP and HR. ICP measurements did not show any significant differences between groups. Bupivacaine group had significantly shorter recovery times and less postoperative pain than fentanyl group. Conclusion: General anesthesia with scalp infiltration using 0.5% bupivacaine compared to I.V fentanyl resulted in a significantly enhanced cardiovascular stability, shorter recovery times and improved postoperative pain scores for supratentorial craniotomy in geriatric patients.",English,0

Design: Prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trial using patients as their own controls. Setting: Community Hospital. Patients: Women undergoing gynecologic surgery using 4 port laparoscopic technique were enrolled and followed postoperatively for 48 hours. Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to either right or left sided surgeon-administered laparoscopic-guided Tap block with 30 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine. The contralateral and midline port sites were infiltrated with an equal total amount of bupivacaine in divided doses. Patients and postoperative nurses were blinded toward the laterality of the treatment. All patients received intraoperative IV acetaminophen and ketorolac. Postoperative narcotics were administered upon patient request. Measurements and Main Results: Postoperative abdominal pain was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24 and 48 hours on the TAP and contralateral sides using a Numeric Rating Scale (0-10). A 2-point difference in the right or left sided reported pain scores was considered clinically significant.

Design and Method: A randomized, single-centre, prospective cohort of patients 16-66 years, ASA I-II undergoing lower limb orthopaedic surgery at UHWI between August and December 2011. In group B, a PNB of the lumbar plexus + sciatic nerve was established under sedation prior to GA, using a peripheral nerve stimulator and ultrasound. Both groups received a standardized GA and were followed for 24 hours postoperatively. Pain intensity, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, satisfaction with the anaesthetic procedure and pain management and postoperative analgesic consumption were assessed. Patients received intravenous morphine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) for analgesia in the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) based on clinical parameters, a verbal response (VRS) pain scale and the visual analogue scale (VAS) and adjunct analgesics on the ward. Data were stored and analysed using the SPSS version 18. Categorical associations were assessed using Pearson's Chi-square and differences between means for normally distributed continuous variables were tested with independent t-test or analysis of variance as appropriate. All statistical tests were two-sided and performed at a significance level of 0.05. Results: Forty patients consented, 20 in each arm. Demographics, blood loss, length of operating time and types of operations performed were not significantly different between the two groups. The PNB+GA patients reported significantly lower pain scores up to 12 hours postoperatively (p < 0.05) and consumed less opioids in the operating theatre and postoperatively (1.5 vs 17 mg morphine; p < 0.001: 25 vs 225 mg pethidine; p < 0.0010) and less other analgesics: diclofenac p < 0.05, metamizole p = 0.037 and paracetamol; p = 0.002. There was a significantly lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the PNB+GA group (10% vs 45%; p = 0.012). The latter spent a shorter time in the PACU (35% vs 80% at 90 minutes; p = 0.006) and also reported higher satisfaction 85% vs 15%. There were two complications in the PNB group: one transient neuropraxia and one sciatic nerve injury. Conclusion: This study confirms that PNB combined with GA provides better immediate postoperative pain management, less opioid consumption with greater satisfaction than GA and opioids alone. However, for this technique to become more readily available administrators will have to address the need for adequate training of personnel and the lack of specialized equipment including peripheral nerve stimulators, stimulating needles and ultrasonography.",English,0

Journal Article,C. Ecoffey,2013.0,Epidural blocks: Still the best option vs tap block vs infiltration?,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AAP.0b013e3182a6a39d,"Effective pain management is a critical component of postoperative care and contributes to fewer postoperative complications, shortened hospital stays, better quality of life, and a decreased incidence of chronic pain postoperatively. Studies indicate that continuous epidural analgesia can be used effectively to manage acute postoperative pain, particularly in children. Indeed, continuous epidural analgesia for children has enjoyed considerable popularity. Futhermore, 2,717 catheters were placed in 2006 during the survey of ADARPEF to ensure continuous postoperative analgesia mainly epidural (56% out of all catheters) (1). 1.Advantages: The continuous epidural analgesia is associated with improved postoperative outcomes, such as less incisional pain, decreased muscle spasms (2), and decreased atelectasis and respiratory complications (3) and may increase gastrointestinal motility (4). Newborn infants who have been managed with continuous epidural analgesia may be intubated for shorter periods, recover more quickly, and experience less pain (5). The combination of a local anesthetic such as ropivacaine or levobupivacaine and an opioid such as fentanyl or sufentanil can optimize pain relief while minimizing side effects (6). However, despite the plethora of published literature on paediatric epidural analgesia, prospective outcome studies demonstrating the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of continuous epidural analgesia over the simple intravenous opioid infusion in children are lacking. 2. Potential drawbacks: Many pediatric anesthetists who were strong and early advocates of the technique, are more reticent in their support today. Indeed, audits of epidural infusions in children have shown that 17-22% of infusions are terminated prematurely (7, 8) and that side-effects or complications occur in 67% of patients (7). Adverse effects of epidurally administered narcotics include respiratory depression, pruritus, urinary retention, nausea and vomiting, and sedation. Adverse effects of epidurally administered local anesthetics include urinary retention, hypotension, numbness, motor weakness and, rarely, systemic toxicity. Epidural analgesia exposes also patients to rare additional risks, at the time of insertion and during the course of the postoperative infusion, as recently reported in a large 5-yr prospective audit of 10 000 paediatric epidural catheter techniques currently taking place in the UK to try to establish the relative risk of these problems in modern practice (9). Complications may be venous air embolism, postdural puncture headache, inadvertent iv administration of local anesthetic, nerve trauma, back pain, epidural hematoma or infection (including osteomyelitis, epidural space infection). In addition, the commonest problems with pediatric regional anesthesia are technical: either failure to establish a block or failure of maintenance of the block. The ultrasonography is helping to perform the puncture introduce the catheter (10). Epidural analgesia is reliant upon optimal positioning of the catheter tip within the epidural space at the appropriate level for the surgery performed. Even with optimal positioning, analgesia may be inadequate (because of pain or discomfort remote to the surgical site from intravenous cannulae, wound or chest drains, urethral or suprapubic catheters, bladder or skeletal muscle spasm), unilateral (e.g. epidural septa) or patchy (e.g. air in epidural space). Futhermore, the epidural catheter tip may be misplaced, in which case the likelihood of achieving satisfactory analgesia is diminished. The tip may be located distant to the nerves supplying the dermatomes that need to be blocked, or the catheter may have been inserted into the subdural space. Finally, epidural infusions are more costly to maintain than intravenous opioid infusions postoperatively. Drugs for epidural infusion are often prepared in a sterile pharmacy environment, increasing the base cost of drugs, which are usually higher than intravenous opioids. In addition, routine pain service consultations take l nger in patients receiving epidural analgesia because, in addition to checking for adequate analgesia, attention must also be paid to pressure care, the state of the epidural insertion site and dressing, degree of motor blockade and dermatome cover. 3. Alternative procedure: TAP blocks have gained a new place in the therapeutic arsenal of pediatric analgesia, following the principle of bene?ts/risks analysis. Indeed, ultrasound- guided TAP block as a single shot block has been suggested for laparotomy, appendectomy, pyloromyotomy, Nissen fundoplication, major abdominal wall surgery, colostomy placement, and closures, whereas ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block has become popular to provide analgesia for umbilical and epigastric hernia repair, laparoscopic surgery, and other small midline incisions (11). But it is still unclear whether both techniques really result in equivalent results. Catheter techniques are used by some experts (12). TAP block can be a valuable alternative to central neuraxial blocks, when these techniques are not applicable, for example, in case of spinal dysraphism or other anomalies of the spinal canal (13). With the exception of high systemic concentrations, up to now, no complication has been attributed to the pediatric TAP block. The technique has undoubtedly the potential to provide analgesia for some hours, allowing a smooth transition from general anesthesia to the postoperative awake period. Infiltration is limited to the skin incision and the indication is different than contiuous epidural analgesia. Paravertebral block is also an alternative technique, but this technique is close an epidural technique (14). In conclusion, the risks of epidural catheter insertion and continuous infusion postoperatively are justified in some groups: those with cognitive impairment (especially self-mutilating behaviour), patients with cerebral palsy predisposed to painful muscle spasms postoperatively, neonates undergoing major laparotomy or tracheo-oesophageal fistula repair where epidural analgesia may reduce the likelihood of postoperative mechanical ventilation (in both) and the potential for barotrauma jeopardizing surgical repair (in the latter), in older children and adolescents where chest physiotherapy is critical (e.g. cystic fibrosis or chest trauma) and in those undergoing extensive laparotomy, painful thoracic surgical procedures such as pectus excavatum repair. The new fashion block, i.e. TAP block, can help sometimes but randomized studies are needed to evaluate the place of each technique.",English,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic review of the literature on the treatment of acute postoperative pain and its usefulness in preventing postoperative chronic pain syndromes. RESULTS: Fifteen studies focusing on 3 conditions were examined: chronic postmastectomy pain syndrome, chronic postthoracotomy pain syndrome, and chronic phantom limb pain. Four clinical trials provided no clear evidence of benefit from preoperative injections of local anesthetic in decreasing the incidence of chronic postmastectomy pain. Continuous thoracic epidural analgesia started before surgery has been shown to have a clearly beneficial effect in preventing chronic pain 3, 6, and 12 months after thoracotomy. Chronic phantom limb pain syndromes have not been found to be prevented by the use of continuous epidural analgesia started before or after surgery in comparison with the injection of local anesthetics through a perineural catheter or the oral or intramuscular administration of morphine-like drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Only chronic pain following thoracotomy has been found to be preempted by acute pain management and only by continuous thoracic epidural analgesia started before surgery. There is no solid evidence demonstrating that other techniques used to relieve acute postoperative pain have a beneficial effect in preempting chronic postoperative pain syndromes.",spa,0

This prospective study compares the efficacy of continuous TAP blockade after post-bariatric (PB) abdominoplasty to a single-shot injection. Materials and Methods: After written consent, 26 patients, 18 to 65 years old, scheduled for PB abdominoplasty, were randomly allocated in 2 groups. In the continuous TAP block group (study group, n = 13), ultrasound-guided bilateral catheter placement at the end of the surgery was facilitated by hydrodissection. Continuous 5 ml/hour infusion of ropivacaine 0.1% delivered a total content of 300 ml per side. In the single-shot group (control group, n = 13) patients received ultrasound guided bilateral TAP block with a 200 mg of ropivacaine 0.5%. Supplemental analgesia consisted of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), paracetamol and NSAIDs in both groups. Primarily, we assessed pain scores with the Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after surgery and total morphine consumption at 96 hours. Time to mobilization, incidence of nausea, vomiting and complications of TAP catheters were also recorded. Data were compared using Chi-Squared, t-test (mean values, p< 0.05 significant) and Fisher's exact test. Results: Demographics did not differ between the two groups (p>0.05). Continuous TAP block group showed, at rest and in motion, significantly lower pain scores at 2, 6, 12, 24 hours after surgery and thereafter.

Direct placement of electrodes along the target peripheral nerve during PNS may circumvent the difficulty of dorsal column stimulator lead placement in the post-surgical spine. Additionally, recent improvements in technique have made PNS less invasive through percutaneous electrode placement under fluoroscopic guidance. Case Report: A 57-year-old male with history of thoracic microdiscectomy resulting in Brown-Sequard syndrome who presented with chronic post-operative thoracic radicular pain radiating to the abdomen, refractory to conservative management. The patient underwent a series of three intercostal nerve blocks from T7 to T9 with transient symptomatic relief. The patients options were limited to chemomodulation, neuromodulation, or selective intercostal nerve surgical neurectomy. He subsequently underwent a PNS trial and reported >75% pain reduction. Permanent percutaneous PNS electrodes were implanted at the right T7 and T9 intercostal nerves and replicated the trial results. Conclusion: Chronic radicular pain may be difficult to manage in the post-surgical patient and often requires the use of multiple therapeutic modalities. We successfully utilized PNS in this case as it demonstrated greater technical feasibility when compared to spinal cord stimulation and repeat surgery; therefore, it may be considered for the management of post-surgical neuropathy.

METHODS: Healthy women undergoing outpatient gynecological laparoscopy were randomly allocated to receive a preoperative TAP block using saline, ropivacaine 0.25%, or ropivacaine 0.5%. Needle placement for the TAP blocks was performed using ultrasound guidance and 15 mL of the study solution was injected bilaterally by a blinded investigator. QoR-40 score and analgesic use were assessed 24 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was global QoR-40 score at 24 hours after surgery. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were made using the Dunn test with P values and 95% confidence intervals Bonferroni corrected for 6 comparisons. RESULTS: Seventy-five subjects were enrolled and 70 subjects completed the study. The median (range) for the QoR-40 score after the TAP block was 157 (127-193), 173 (133-195), and 172 (130-196) for the saline group and 0.25% and 0.5% ropivacaine groups, respectively. The median difference (99.2% confidence interval) in QoR-40 score for 0.5% bupivacaine (16 [1-30], P=0.03) and 0.25% bupivacaine (17 [2-31], P=0.01) was more than saline but not significantly different between ropivacaine groups (-1 [-16 to 12], P=1.0). Increased global QoR-40 scores correlated with decreased area under the pain score time curve during postanesthesia recovery room stay (rho=-0.56, 99.2% upper confidence limit [UCL]=-0.28), 24-hour opioid consumption (rho=-0.61, 99.2% UCL=-0.34), pain score (0-10 scale) at 24 hours (rho=-0.53, 99.2% UCL=-0.25), and time to discharge readiness (rho=-0.65, 99.2% UCL=-0.42). The aforementioned variables were lower in the TAP block groups receiving ropivacaine compared with saline. CONCLUSIONS: The TAP block is an effective adjunct in a multimodal analgesic strategy for ambulatory laparoscopic procedures. TAP blocks with ropivacaine 0.25% and 0.5% reduced pain, decreased opioid consumption, and provided earlier discharge readiness that was associated with better quality of recovery.",eng,1

Several studies have examined the effect of the TAP block on postoperative pain outcomes after laparoscopic surgical procedures and generated conflicting results. Our main objective in the current investigation was to evaluate the effect of TAP block on postoperative analgesia outcomes for laparoscopic surgical procedures. METHODS: A search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of the TAP block compared with an inactive group (placebo or no treatment"") on postoperative pain outcomes in laparoscopic surgical procedures. Primary outcomes included early (0-4 hours) and late (24 hours) postoperative pain at rest and on movement and postoperative opioid consumption (up to 24 hours). Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Publication bias was evaluated by examining the presence of asymmetric funnel plots using Egger regression test. Meta-regression analysis was performed to establish an association between the local anesthetic dose and the evaluated outcomes. RESULTS: Ten randomized clinical trials with 633 subjects were included in the analysis. The weighted mean difference (99% confidence interval) of the combined effects favored TAP block over control for pain at rest (</=4 hours, -2.41 [-3.6 to -1.16]) and (at 24 hours, -1.33 [-2.19 to -0.48]) (0-10 numerical scale). Postoperative opioid consumption was decreased in the TAP block group compared with control, weighted mean difference (99% confidence interval) of -5.74 (-8.48 to -2.99) mg morphine IV equivalents. Publication bias was not present in any of the analysis. Preoperative TAP block administration resulted in greater effects on early pain and opioid consumption compared with postoperative administration. Meta-regression analysis revealed an association between local anesthetic dose and the TAP block effect on late pain at rest and postoperative opioid consumption. None of the studies reported symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: TAP block is an effective strategy to improve early and late pain at rest and to reduce opioid consumption after laparoscopic surgical procedures. In contrast, the TAP block was not superior compared with control to reduce early and late pain during movement. Preoperative administration of a TAP block seems to result in greater effects on postoperative pain outcomes. We also detected a local anesthetic dose response on late pain and postoperative opioid consumption.""",eng,1

Chambers,1984.0,"Pain amelioration after thoracotomy: a prospective, randomized study",", ","Twenty patients undergoing a posterolateral thoracotomy for lung resection or a nonpulmonary procedure were divided into four groups. Group 1 was the control group. Patients in Group 2 had an intercostal nerve block at the time of closure. Those in Group 3 underwent a continuous intercostal nerve block for five days. Electronic pain control was used in Group 4. An additional group of patients underwent operation through an anterolateral thoracotomy (Group 5) and was compared with the control group. Breathing performance was evaluated daily for five days with bedside spirometry, and intergroup comparison was done utilizing the unpaired t test and analysis of variance. Forced expiratory volume in one second, expressed as percent of preoperative values, was significantly better in Group 3 (continuous intercostal nerve block) at 52.4 +/- 9.2% (standard deviation; p less than 0.05) and in Group 5 (anterolateral thoracotomy) at 52.0 +/- 7.5% (p less than 0.05) than in the control group (38.4 +/- 8.8%) five days postoperatively. It is concluded that bedside spirometry is a simple and reliable technique to assess postoperative changes in ventilatory mechanics due to pain. The pain that follows posterolateral thoracotomy can be substantially decreased with a continuous intercostal nerve block. Anterolateral thoracotomy is notably less painful than posterolateral thoracotomy and should be considered the approach of choice for patients with decreased pulmonary reserve who undergo uncomplicated pulmonary resection.",eng,0

No difference was seen between caudal and parenteral analgesia in the need for rescue or other analgesia (relative risk (RR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 1.43; 4 trials, 235 boys; random-effects model) or on the incidence of nausea and vomiting (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.05; 4 trials, 235 boys). No difference in the need for rescue or other analgesia was seen for caudal compared with dorsal nerve penile block (DNPB) (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.44; 4 trials, 336 boys; random-effects model). No differences were seen between caudal block and DNPB in the incidence of nausea and vomiting (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 5.04; 4 trials, 334 boys; random effects model) or individual complications except for motor block (RR 17.00, 95% CI 1.01 to 286.82; 1 trial, 100 boys) and motor or leg weakness (RR 10.67, 95% CI 1.32 to 86.09; 2 trials, 107 boys). These were significantly more common in the caudal block groups than with DNPB. No differences were seen between caudal and rectal or intravenous analgesia in the need for rescue analgesia or any other outcomes (2 trials, 162 boys)., Authors' conclusions, Differences in the need for rescue or other analgesia could not be detected between caudal, parenteral and penile block methods. In day-case surgery, penile block may be preferable to caudal block in children old enough to walk due to the possibility of temporary leg weakness after caudal block. Evidence from trials is limited by small numbers and poor methodology. There is a need for properly designed trials comparing caudal epidural block with other methods such as morphine, simple analgesics and topical local anaesthetic creams, emulsions or gels.",English.,0

Flood,2011.0,A randomised trial comparing two nerve block techniques for post operative analgesia in paediatric circumcision,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1569-9056%2811%2960202-9,"Introduction & Objectives: Techniques to minimize the postoperative discomfort of circumcision include caudal block, penile nerve block, systemic opioids, and topical local anaesthetics. Since its description by Kirya & Werthmann in 1978, the dorsal nerve block (DNB) of the penis as an adjunct to general anesthesia in paediatric circumcision is a well established technique of minimising post operative discomfort. However, this technique has not been standardized and variations in the technique had led to varying degrees of efficacy. This institution has developed a novel technique whereby the dorsal penile nerves are infiltrated bilaterally with local anaesthetic at the root of the penis - locally termed the 'Buck's fascia block' (BFB) which involves introducing a 25G needle dorsally at the base of the penis, deep to the skin at the ten and two o'clock positions. This technique has been previously described and published as an effective technique for circumcision under local anaesthetic (LA). As with the traditional DNB, ventral infiltration of LA at the site of incision is necessary for complete anaesthesia of the frenular area. Materials & Methods: 28 children (aged 26 months to 156 months), ASA physical status I and II, who were scheduled for elective circumcision, were randomly assigned to have either the traditional dorsal nerve block (DNB) or the bucks fascia block (BFB).Each nerve block was performed by the same operating surgeon in each case who also completed each circumcision in the sleeve manner. The efficacy of postoperative analgesia was measured using the modified objective pain score (OPS), in which objective behavioural variables (crying, degree of agitation, motor restlessness, pain localization) together with changes in systolic blood pressure. An increase in heart rate or mean arterial pressure of >10% during surgery was defined as 'insufficient intraoperative analgesia' and treated with fentanyl 3 mcg/kg i.v. If the OPS score was >7 (5 if child unable to verbalise) in 2 subsequent measurements the child received morphine 0.05mg/kg boluses until the pain abated. Results: A total of 6 children in the DNB group were deemed to have had 'insufficient intraoperative anaesthesia' compared to 1 in the BFB group (p=0.114).2 children in the DNB received 'rescue morphine' compared to zero in the BFB group (p=0.541). The OPS in the recovery room was significantly lower for the children who had the BFB than those who had the DNB (mean 0.50 vs 2.21 p=0.044).All of the children who received the BFB had an OPS score of 0,1 or 2 in the recovery room compared to a broader range for the DNB group. When the OPS was assessed two hours post circumcision, there were no significant differences between the scores for both groups (mean 0.07 vs 0.14, p=0.769). Conclusions: BFB represents an efficient reproducible technique of improving intra and post operative analgesia over traditional DNB in paediatric circumcision.",English,0

METHODS: Forty-two subjects (23 females and 19 males, mean age 23.5 +/- 4) underwent surgical removal of third molars in two separate sessions. Within each patient, levobupivacaine was used to anesthetize one extraction side and for the other side, mepivacaine. Onset of anesthesia, duration of surgery, lip numbness, timing of pain appearance and analgesic consumption were evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in onset of anesthesia, duration of surgical procedure, and lower lip numbness between the two groups (P > .05). Timing of pain appearance and of first drug consumption was significantly lower in the mepivacaine group (P < .05). Patients with levobupivacaine anesthesia had significantly lower visual analog (VAS) pain scores at 1 and 2 hours postoperatively than those with mepivacaine anesthesia. CONCLUSION: Levobupivacaine is a valid alternative to traditional local anesthetics for surgical removal of lower third molars. It presents better pain relief when compared to mepivacaine in the immediate postoperative period as evidenced by lower VAS scores.",eng,0

To date, few studies have examined the role of DPNB prior to inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) implantation. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of local penile nerve block prior to IPP implantation for post-operative pain control. Materials and Methods: Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Patients with erectile dysfunction scheduled for IPP implantation were approached for study participation. Patients were excluded if they had a previous IPP scheduled for revision or replacement or were undergoing additional procedures during the same operative session. Patients were then randomized to either DPNB with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine without epinephrine or injectable saline placebo. Only the resident surgeon assisting in the case was aware of randomization. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon (CCC). Postoperatively, patients were asked to rate their pain using a Visual Analog Scale hourly while in recovery, at 4 hours, and at 23 hours postoperatively. Total narcotic usage was also measured. Results: A total of 30 patients underwent randomization with 15 patients in each group. Baseline demographic data were similar in each group. There was a significant reduction in pain in the immediate postoperative period and at 4 hours after surgery in the treatment group when compared to placebo (VAS 2.5 vs. 5.3, p = 0.009 at 0 hours; VAS 2.8 vs. 5.1, p = 0.011 at 4 hours).

We evaluated the efficacy of the TAP block for post-cesarean delivery (CD) patients used as a part of a multimodal regimen. METHODS: Women undergoing elective CD under spinal anesthesia were randomized to receive the TAP block with ropivacaine (n = 50) or placebo (n = 50), in addition to a standard postoperative analgesic regimen inclusive of intrathecal opioids. At the end of the surgical procedure, all the patients received bilateral TAP blocks under real-time ultrasound guidance, with either 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.375% or saline, on each side. Each patient was assessed at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hrs postoperatively, and again 6 weeks after the surgical procedure. The primary outcome was the difference in visual analog scale pain scores with movement at 24 hrs postpartum. Other outcomes assessed were analgesic consumption, maternal satisfaction, and incidence of adverse effects. RESULTS: One hundred women were recruited, and 96 completed the study.

Which one is the best method?,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/IMI.0b013e31822266c6,"Objective: The use of drain in thoracic and cardiac operations is frequent. Every year there are placed more than 1 million chest tubes in USA, and we can imagine how many drains are used worldwide per year. The presence of chest drains is synonymous of postoperative pain and its withdrawal is a discomfort to the patient. The pain during the removal is characterized as one of the most distressing for patients and some have reported as the worst memory during hospitalization. Despite its very frequent use, few studies about the best way to remove a drain were done and we are far from a consensus. Currently, using small bore and soft drains would the removal be a painful experience? We propose a prospective randomized trial to compare chest drain removal with or without local anesthetic. Methods: We evaluated all patients undergoing chest tube drainage (one drain), size 28 Fr and elective procedures. There were two groups: A-without local anesthetic and group B - with a local anesthetic (lidocaine 2%-10 ml injected around the drain with anesthesia of the intercostal space). Exclusion criteria: patients with history of chronic pain. Chronic use of analgesics. Patients were evaluated by a questionnaire to verify the pain by scale- visual analog 0 to 10. This study was approved by the ethics committee, number 1111/09. Results: The groups were similar in age, gender, BMI, type of procedure performed, drainage time and length of hospital stay.

O'Donnell et al. demonstrated the efficacy of the TAP block for post-operative analgesia following prostatectomies(1). Other studies report that the addition of dexamethasone(dex) to local anesthetics improves analgesia from brachial plexus peripheral nerve blocks(2,3). However, there are no published reports studying adjuncts for TAP blocks to prolong the duration of analgesia. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of dex added to local anesthetic in prolonging analgesia following TAP blocks in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. Materials and Methods: After obtaining IRB approval, 50 male patients undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy by a single surgeon at our institution are to be enrolled for this study. The sample size was chosen based on an anticipated difference of a minimum 25% change in the mean duration of analgesia, based on data from other peripheral nerve block studies with dex. At 80% power, 21 patients per treatment arm need to be analyzed. We assume a 15% dropout rate in the analysis population. After informed consent was obtained, patients were randomized into two treatment arms, 0.125% bupivicaine 40 cc plus 4mg dex (20 cc and 2mg dex on each side of the abdomen), or 0.125% bupiviciane 40 cc plus 1 cc of saline. Visual analog scales(VAS) and dermatomal level of sensory block were used for data collection in standardized time intervals. Time to first additional analgesic administration, and total intraoperative and post-operative narcotic use were recorded. Pending data analysis of treatment effect from this study, we plan to continue the study and enroll patients undergoing other abdominal surgeries. In this second portion of the study, patients undergoing bilateral TAP block procedures for post-operative analgesia will receive blinded dex on only one side of their abdomen allowing patients to serve as their own control. Results: As of the date of submission 20 patients have been enrolled into Phase 1 of the study. Time to first request for analgesia following TAP blockade has ranged from 121 minutes to 1118 minutes (n=17, mean 493 min, median 431 min). No adverse events have been reported in the study to date. Discussion: Our analysis remains blinded at present however we expect that complete data from Phase 1 of the study will be available for presentation at the meeting. The mean duration of blockade cannot be compared with previous studies since volume and concentration of local anesthetic is different. It is hoped that the development of the model of study in Phase 2 will allow powered analyses of efficacy of adjunctive pharmacotherapy with small numbers of patients. Using the model developed in Phase 2 of the study, we hope that future research may investigate the efficacy of other anesthetic adjuncts to the TAP block.",English,0

This is an update of a review first published in 2006 and updated in 2011., Objectives, To compare the relative effects (benefits and harms) of three injection techniques (single, double and multiple) of axillary block of the brachial plexus for distal upper extremity surgery. We considered these effects primarily in terms of anaesthetic effectiveness; the complication rate (neurological and vascular); and pain and discomfort caused by performance of the block., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and reference lists of trials. We contacted trial authors. The date of the last search was March 2013 (updated from March 2011)., Selection criteria, We included randomized controlled trials that compared double with single-injection techniques, multiple with single-injection techniques, or multiple with double-injection techniques for axillary block in adults undergoing surgery of the distal upper limb. We excluded trials using ultrasound-guided techniques., Data collection and analysis, Independent study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed by at least two investigators. We undertook meta-analysis., Main results, The 21 included trials involved a total of 2148 participants who received regional anaesthesia for hand, wrist, forearm or elbow surgery. Risk of bias assessment indicated that trial design and conduct were generally adequate; the most common areas of weakness were in blinding and allocation concealment., Authors' conclusions, This review provides evidence that multiple-injection techniques using nerve stimulation for axillary plexus block produce more effective anaesthesia than either double or single-injection techniques.

It is not clear which is the technique of choice for providing surgical anaesthesia of the lower arm, although infraclavicular blockade (ICB) has several purported advantages. We therefore performed a systematic review of ICB compared to the other brachial plexus blocks (BPBs). This review was originally published in 2010 and was updated in 2013., Objectives, The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of infraclavicular block (ICB) compared to other approaches to the brachial plexus in providing regional anaesthesia for surgery on the lower arm., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 5); MEDLINE (1966 to June 2013) via OvidSP; and EMBASE (1980 to June 2013) via OvidSP. We also searched conference proceedings (from 2004 to 2012) and the trials registry. The searches for the original review were performed in September 2008., Selection criteria, We included any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ICB with other BPBs as the sole anaesthetic technique for surgery on the lower arm., Data collection and analysis, The primary outcome was adequate surgical anaesthesia within 30 minutes of block completion. Secondary outcomes included sensory block of individual nerves, tourniquet pain, onset time of sensory blockade, block performance time, block-associated pain and complications related to the block., Main results, In our original review we included 15 studies with 1020 participants and excluded two. In this updated review we included seven new studies and excluded six, bringing the total number of included studies to 22 and involving 1732 participants. The control group intervention was the axillary block in 14 studies, supraclavicular block in six studies, mid-humeral block in two studies, and parascalene block in one study. One study compared ICB to both axillary and supraclavicular blocks. Nine studies employed ultrasound-guided ICB. The risk of failed surgical anaesthesia 30 minutes after block completion was similar for ICB and all other BPBs (11.4% versus 12.9%, risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.52, P = 0.64), but tourniquet pain was less likely with ICB (11.9% versus 18.0%; RR of experiencing tourniquet pain 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.92, P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis by method of nerve localization, and by control group intervention, did not show any statistically significant differences in the risk of failed surgical anaesthesia. However when compared to a single-injection axillary block, ICB was better at providing complete sensory block of the musculocutaneous nerve (RR for failure 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.60, P < 0.0001). ICB had a slightly longer sensory block onset time (mean difference (MD) 1.9 min, 95% CI 0.2 to 3.6, P = 0.03) but was faster to perform than multiple-injection axillary (MD -2.7 min, 95% CI -3.4 to -2.0, P < 0.00001) or mid-humeral (MD -4.8 min, 95% CI -6.0 to -3.6, P < 0.00001) blocks., Authors' conclusions, ICB is as safe and effective as any other BPBs, regardless of whether ultrasound or neurostimulation guidance is used. The advantages of ICB include a lower likelihood of tourniquet pain during surgery, more reliable blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve when compared to a single-injection axillary block, and a significantly shorter block performance time compared to multi-injection axillary and mid-humeral blocks.",English.,0

However, to our knowledge the efficacy of a penile block immediately before versus immediately after surgery for postoperative pain control has not been previously studied in such children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 98 healthy boys 6 months to 12 years old undergoing hypospadias repair. General anesthesia was induced and maintained in a standard fashion. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a penile block with the same total dose of bupivacaine at the completion of surgery, before the incision or before and at the completion of surgery. No other analgesic was administered intraoperatively. Pain was assessed using a modified objective pain-discomfort scale at 15 minutes, and 3, 12 and 24 hours after surgery. The number of doses of acetaminophen required to control postoperative pain was also recorded. RESULTS: Pain scores were defined in a range of 0-no pain to 6-greatest pain. During recovery median pain scores in the 30, 36 and 32 boys who received a penile block after, before, and before and after surgery were 3, 1.5 and 0 at 15 minutes; 2.5, 1 and 0 at 3 hours; 3, 2 and 0 at 12 hours; and 1, 0 and 0 at 24 hours, respectively. There was no difference in acetaminophen doses required 15 minutes and 3 hours postoperatively in the 3 groups. By 12 hours after surgery the number of acetaminophen doses required for pain control was significantly lower in the before and after, and before groups than in the after group. By 24 hours boys in the before and after group required significantly fewer doses of analgesics than those in the after and before groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the after and before groups. CONCLUSIONS: Two penile blocks performed at the beginning and conclusion of hypospadias repair, respectively, provide better postoperative pain control than 1 penile block done before or after surgery (p < 0.05). These patients require less analgesic than those who receive a penile block only before or only after surgery.",eng,0

Seventy-five ASA physical status I and II children (aged 1 to 10 yr) with unilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia were randomly divided into three groups. Group A received IG/IH nerve block, using 0.25% bupivacaine (1 mg/kg) immediately after induction. Group B received intravenous fentanyl (1 microgram/kg) immediately after induction. Group C received only general anesthesia as control. At postanesthetic care unit (PACU), we recorded the degree of pain/or discomfort at 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min using modified Hannallah's scoring system after the patient was fully awake. The degree of recovery was also evaluated using Steward's scoring system. After discharge, the parents were interrogated about the condition of child within 24 h by telephone. Follow-up items raised included vomiting, drowsiness, pain and shivering. Our results showed that children in both study groups had lower pain score than those in the control group, and in the fentanyl group children had lower pain score than in the nerve block group during the first 30 min at PACU. The recovery time was also longer in the fentanyl group. There was no significant difference among the three groups regarding the raised items over telephone interrogation. In sum, inguinal nerve block was effective for postoperative pain relief in children undergoing inguinal herniorraphy. We also suggested that small dose of intravenous fentanyl would serve as an easy, simple and effective means for relieving postinguinal herniorrhaphy pain during the first 30 min of the initial postoperative period.",eng,0

The objective of this study was to report the authors' experience of intraoperative oblique subcostal TAP blockade during open cholecystectomy. Case report: This is a case series of 10 patients who had bilateral oblique subcostal TAP blockade for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy which was subsequently converted to open cholecystectomy. Intraoperative haemodynamic parameters (pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure) were recorded every five minutes. A rescue bolus of intravenous fentanyl (0.5 mug/kg) was given when any of the above-mentioned parameters were raised more than 15% from the baseline. The postoperative visual analogue score (VAS) was recorded in the recovery room. Intraoperative administration of rescue fentanyl bolus was minimal with a mean postoperative VAS of 2.1 + 1.60. No complications were noted related to TAP blockade. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided oblique subcostal TAP blockade can be effective as intraoperative analgesia in abdominal surgery. Randomised controlled studies comparing TAP blockade with other modes of analgesia are needed to determine its efficacy for abdominal surgery. SASA.",English,0

The management of postoperative pain involves assessment of the pain in terms of intensity at rest and activity associated pain, treatment by pharmacological and non pharmacological means as well as monitoring induced side-effects. Besides being physically and emotionally disabling, the pain is associated with various physiological effects involving the increased perioperative stress response. The pain causes the patient to remain immobile, thus becoming vulnerable to DVT, pulmonary atelectasis, muscle wasting and urinary retention. Poor control of postoperative pain could be due to various reasons which may include uniformed prescribing without taking into consideration the individual patient's physical status, the surgery that has been performed or the site and intensity of pain. Besides, the poor compliance of orders in administrating the analgesics prescribed and the fact that optimal pain relief is not aimed for may also contribute to the inadequate management of the pain occurring in the postoperative period. Thus, despite all efforts, there continues to be inadequate pain relief in a large majority of patients. The introduction of multimodal analgesia including opioids and non-opioids, delivered through various routes, neuraxial use of local anesthetics, either alone or in combination with other drugs, nerve blocks, antihyperalgesics and techniques such as patient controlled analgesia and pre-emptive analgesia have greatly improved the efficacy of pain-control while minimizing the side-effects of any one modality. The recent recommendation of planning the pain services in an organized manner and implementation of Acute Pain Services (APS) has proven to be beneficial and rewarding.",English,0

In the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), a trained blinded observer evaluated the patient's level of postoperative pain using a standardized 10-point objective pain scale. Fentanyl 1-2 micrograms/kg was administered intravenously to any child scoring 6 or more points on the pain scale. The difference in pain scores among the two groups were compared. The two groups were not significantly different in age, duration of surgery, or anesthesia. There was no significant difference between patients who received the two treatment modalities in their pain scores, analgesic requirements in the PACU, recovery times, and discharge times. These results demonstrate that the simple instillation of local anesthetics into a wound provides postoperative pain relief following hernia repair, which is as effective as that provided by intraoperative IG/IH nerve block.",eng,1

METHODS: Forty-two ASA physical status II-III patients undergoing lung resection surgery were randomly allocated to receive post-thoracotomy analgesia with either a thoracic epidural (group EPI, n = 21) or paravertebral (group PVB, n = 21) infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine (infusion rate: 5-10 mL h-1). The degree of pain at rest and during coughing, haemodynamic variables and blood gas analysis were recorded every 12 h for the first 48 h. RESULTS: The area under the curve of the visual analogue pain score during coughing over time was 192 (60-444) cm h-1 in group EPI and 228 (72-456) cm h-1 in group PVB (P = 0.29). Rescue morphine analgesia was required in four patients of group EPI (19%) and five patients of group PVB (23%) (P = 0.99). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio reduced significantly from baseline values in both groups without between-group differences. The median (range) percentage reduction of systolic arterial pressure from baseline was -9 (0 to -9)% in group PVB and -17 (0 to -38)% in group EPI (P = 0.02); while clinically relevant hypotension (systolic arterial pressure decrease >30% of baseline) was observed in four patients of group EPI only (19%) (P = 0.04). Patient satisfaction with the analgesia technique was 8.5 (8-9.8) cm in group EPI and 9 (7.5-10) cm in group PVB (P = 0.65).

Epidural analgesia is effective in the treatment of post-thoracotomy pain but may give rise to significant side-effects. Other low-risk and cost-effective analgesic treatments are therefore required. METHODS: Thirty male patients who had undergone pulmonary lobectomy entered a prospective, randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of ketorolac tromethamine (Group 2) and extrapleural intercostal nerve block (Group 3) with intermittent low-dose bupivacaine. Objective and subjective assessment was carried out at 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between Groups 1 (control group) and 2. Vital capacity was significantly lower in Group 3 (p<0.05) than in Group 1 after 16 hours. Forced Vital Capacity was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 3 after 16 and 24 hours (p<0.05).

The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a recently described approach to providing analgesia to the anterior abdominal wall. We evaluated the analgesic efficacy of the TAP block in patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy via a transverse lower abdominal wall incision, in a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. METHODS: Fifty females undergoing elective total abdominal hysterectomy were randomized to undergo TAP block with ropivacaine (n = 24) versus placebo (n = 26) in addition to standard postoperative analgesia comprising patient-controlled IV morphine analgesia and regular diclofenac and acetaminophen. All patients received a general anesthetic and, before surgical incision, a bilateral TAP block was performed using 1.5 mg/kg ropivacaine (to a maximal dose of 150 mg) or saline on each side. Each patient was assessed postoperatively by a blinded investigator in the postanesthesia care unit and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 h postoperatively. RESULTS: The TAP block with ropivacaine reduced postoperative visual analog scale pain scores compared to placebo block. Mean (+/-SD) total morphine requirements in the first 48 postoperative hours were also reduced (55 +/- 17 mg vs 27 +/- 20 mg, P < 0.001).

Post-operative pain is a common occurrence after this type of surgery.1 Previous studies have shown improved intra-operative anesthesia and post-operative analgesia in patients undergoing proximal brachial plexus blockade plus multiple terminal nerve blocks.2,3 This study examined whether prolonged analgesia was achieved after supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade plus a supplementary ulnar nerve block versus supraclavicular block alone for patients undergoing hand surgery in the ulnar distribution. Material and methods: After institutional ethics approval, adult elective day-surgery patients undergoing surgery on the fourth and/or fifth metacarpals and/or phalanges were recruited to the study. Patients randomized to the control group received a standard ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block using 25-30 mL of 1.5% lidocaine + 0.125% bupivacaine. Patients in the study group received a reduced-volume ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block of 20 mL 1.5% lidocaine + 0.125% bupivacaine plus an ulnar nerve block using 5 mL of a 0.5% ropivacaine + 0.125% bupivacaine solution. Block performance time was recorded, and patients were contacted the following day to assess the onset of sensation and movement in the affected limb as well as maximum numerical rating scale pain score. Results: Twenty-five patients were recruited to the study; five were lost to follow up, leaving ten in each group. On average, total time to perform the block(s) was longer for the combined block patients than the supraclavicular-only patients (13.3 + 7.5 min vs. 10.7 + 4.8 min), but not significantly so (p=0.36). Patients who received a combined block experienced later onset of pain compared to the control group (525.8 + 238.9 min vs. 296.3 + 61.3 min; p=0.014). Time to maximal pain sensation was also longer in the combined block group (621.8 + 282.7 min vs. 363.8 + 82.9 min; p=0.019). The average pain intensity after recovery of sensation was similar between the two groups (6/10 study group vs 6.6/10 control group). Discussion: Administering a supplementary ulnar nerve block in addition to a supraclavicular block did not significantly extend block performance time and provided, on average, over three hours more pain relief compared to patients receiving a standard supraclavicular block.

TEA may be contraindicated in the presence of coagulopathy or infection. TAPB may be used as an alternate analgesic technique, but has never been directly compared to TEA. This study compares outcomes between patients receiving TEA and TAPB following major abdominal surgery. Methods: After IRB approval and informed consent, 50 patients are scheduled to be randomized into two groups in this open label study. Group 1 received catheter congruent TEA initiated with 0.25% bupivacaine to establish a sensory block between T6-T12 bilaterally. Patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) was continued for 48-72 hours with a mixture of bupivacaine 0.1% with hydromorphone 10 mcg/mL with a basal rate of 6mL/h and PCEA bolus of 3mL, lockout period of 20 minutes. Group 2 had bilateral TAPB catheters inserted using ultrasonography. A bolus of 25 to 30mL per side of 0.5% ropivacaine was used to distend the space, and 2 catheters per side were then inserted. The catheters were connected to an elastomeric pump set to deliver 2mL/catheter/hr of 0.35% ropivacaine for 48-72hours. Patients in the TAPB Group were also provided with IV patient controlled analgesia (PCA) using hydromorphone or morphine. All patients received a standardized general anesthetic. Opioids were titrated intraoperatively as required. The following variables were collected postoperatively at predetermined time periods: verbal reported pain scores at rest and during cough, satisfaction scores and sedation scores, nausea and pruritus scores. Time to onset of bowel sounds, first flatus and first bowel movement, hemodynamic variables, incidence and duration of significant hypotension, opioid consumption and adverse events were collected from patient charts. Results: The initial 21 patients (8 TEA and 13 TAPB) are included in this report. Surgeries consisted of colon resection, pancreatic surgery and closure ileostomy. Demographics, pain scores, satisfaction scores and morphine consumption were not significantly different between the groups. Pulse oxymetric saturation, respiratory rate and sedation scores at all time points were similar between the groups. Time to first bowel sounds, first bowel movement and length of hospital stay were also similar between the groups. Discussion: TAPB provides comparable analgesia to TEA with high patient satisfaction. Opioid consumption measured as IV morphine equivalent was significantly higher with TEA, possibly because of fixed basal delivery rates. TAPB can be a viable alternative to TEA for providing postoperative analgesia following abdominal surgery. (Table presented).",English,0

Interventions are available to reduce pain at circumcision; however, many newborns are circumcised without pain management., Objectives, The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions for reducing pain at neonatal circumcision., Search strategy, We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 - April 2004), EMBASE (1988 - 2004 week 19), CINAHL (1982 - May week 1 2004), Dissertation Abstracts (1986 - May 2004), Proceedings of the World Congress on Pain (1993 - 1999), and reference lists of articles. Language restrictions were not imposed., Selection criteria, Randomised controlled trials comparing pain interventions with placebo or no treatment or comparing two active pain interventions in male term or preterm infants undergoing circumcision., Data collection and analysis, Two independent reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. Ten authors were contacted for additional information. Adverse effects information was obtained from the trial reports. For meta-analysis, data on a continuous scale were reported as weighted mean difference (WMD) or, when the units were not compatible, as standardized mean difference., Main results, Thirty-five trials involving 1,997 newborns were included. Thirty-three trials enrolled healthy, full term neonates, and two enrolled infants born preterm., Fourteen trials involving 592 newborns compared dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with placebo or no treatment. Compared to placebo/no treatment, DPNB demonstrated significantly lower heart rate [WMD -35 bpm, 95% CI -41 to -30], decreased time crying [WMD -54 %, 95% CI -64 to -44], and increased oxygen saturation [WMD 3.7 %, 95% CI 2.7 to 3.7]. Six trials involving 200 newborns compared eutectic mixture of analgesics (EMLA) with placebo. EMLA demonstrated significantly lower facial action scores [WMD -46.5, 95% CI -80.4 to -12.6], decreased time crying [WMD - 15.2 %, 95% CI -21 to -9.3] and lower heart rate [WMD -15 bpm, 95% CI -19 to -10]. DPNB, compared with EMLA in three trials involving 139 newborns (133 of whom were included in the analysis), demonstrated significantly lower heart rate [WMD -17 bpm, 95% CI -23 to -11] and pain scores. When compared with sucrose in two trials involving 127 newborns, DPNB demonstrated less time crying [MD -166 s, 95% CI -211 to -121], and lower heart rate [WMD -27 bpm, 95% CI -33 to -20]. Results obtained for trials comparing oral sucrose and oral analgesics to placebo, and trials of environmental modification were either inconsistent or were not significantly different., Authors' conclusions, DPNB was the most frequently studied intervention and was the most effective for circumcision pain. Compared to placebo, EMLA was also effective, but was not as effective as DPNB. Both interventions appear to be safe for use in newborns. None of the studied interventions completely eliminated the pain response to circumcision.",English.,1

METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was performed after institutional review board approval. Sixty women were randomized to receive bupivacaine or saline for hydrodissection. Subjects and research team were blinded to subject assignments. Group characteristics were compared using the Student t test, the chi test, and the Mann-Whitney U test. Proportions of subjects with a successful postoperative voiding trial along with measurements of postoperative pain and analgesic use were compared using similar appropriate tests. The study was powered to detect differences in voiding trial success from an estimated 58% to greater than 90% with P < 0.05 and 0.8 power using 25 subjects per group. RESULTS: Thirty patients were allocated to each group. One subject in the saline-only group was excluded. Group characteristics were not different. After surgery, pain medication use (20/30 vs 25/29 for bupivacaine vs saline only; P = 0.08), pain scores (36 +/- 22 vs 31 +/- 24; P = 0.49), and successful voiding trials did not differ (14/30 vs 19/29; P = 0.14), whereas postvoid residuals did differ (225 +/- 180 mL vs 140 +/- 147 mL; P = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Bupivacaine was not seen to improve immediate postoperative pain after placement of a tension-free vaginal tape. It did not increase the risk of failing a postoperative voiding trial. Without an obvious benefit, the use of an additional medicine is not supported. We suggest saline alone be used for hydrodissection.",eng,0

The aim of this study was to compare pain relief after caesarean section achieved by an intra-abdominal iliohypogastric and ilio-inguinal (IHII) nerve block with levobupivacaine with that in patients given a placebo. Study design. A total of 60 healthy women scheduled for caesarean delivery under general anaesthesia were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomised to an abdominal IHII nerve block with levobupivacaine (levobupivacaine group) or administration of saline (placebo group). Instead of the classic percutaneous method, the block was administered intra-operatively from the peritoneal aspect. Scores on a visual analogue scale (VAS) at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours, adverse effects, morphine consumption and success of blockage by a pinprick test were recorded. Results. In the levobupivacaine group, the pinprick test showed there to be successful bilateral block in 22 patients and unilateral block in 5, while the block failed in 3. No block was recorded in the placebo group. When morphine consumption at 12 and 24 hours were compared, consumption was found to be significantly low for both time points in the levobupivacaine group. VAS scores 2, 6 and 12 hours after the operation were also significantly lower in the levobupivacaine group. Conclusion. A block of the IHII nerves from inside the abdomen just before abdominal closure appears to be an effective and safe way of relieving pain after caesarean section.",English,1

Method. With ethical approval, 20 pain-free patients (15 male, 5 female) presenting over 1 year to the Ocular Oncology Service who were undergoing enucleation and primary orbital implantation (17 hydroxyapapetite, 3 Medpor) were invited to participate in the study. A retrobulbar injection of bupivicaine 75mg (11 patients) or ropivicaine 75mg (9 patients) in 10ml saline with or without 1/200,000 adrenaline was administered following induction of general anesthesia. Standardized anesthetic, operative and postoperative protocols were followed. A four point Verbal Rating Scale (VRS-4) and 10 an Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to measure subjective experience of pain at 1, 2,4,8 and 24 hours following the block. The type, dose and time of analgesia were also recorded. Results: None of the patients required any supplementary analgesia for the first 5 hours post block. Pain occurrence rates on VRS-4 for bupivicaine and ropivicaine at 4 hours were 2/11 with moderate pain and 1/9 with mild pain respectively. No patients described severe pain. This difference did not reach statistical significance on x2 testing with large confidence intervals (-45,+31). Mean VAS pain score for all patients at 2 hours was 4.25/100 (range 0-32/100, SD 8.95) and 4 hours was 3.85/100 (range 0-26/100, SD 7.00). At 8 hours 11/20 patients (55%) had still not required any analgesia, 9 of these remaining pain free on VRS-4. By 24 hours 75% patients had requested supplementary analgesia No adverse events were recorded. Conclusions: Retrobulbar block with bupivicaine cc ropivicaine in our sample of patients appears to provide excellent early postoperative analgesia following enucleation of the eye for choroidal melanoma. We recommend its use in addition to standard analgesia in controlling pain after this procedure. We were unable to show a statistically significant difference between bupivicaine and ropivicaine. A larger multi-centre clinical trial may be able so demonstrate this.",,0

It appears that a local anesthetic only, single injection TAP block conveys no benefit compared to intrathecal morphine, the current standard. To date, no trials have investigated ways to prolong the duration of a single injection TAP block and its impact on wound hyperalgesia (WHA), considered a risk factor for chronic pain after Cesarean delivery. We hypothesized that the anti-WHA effects of clonidine added to bupivacaine for a single injection TAP block would reduce 48 hour WHA and the incidence of persistent postsurgical pain (PPP). Methods: Ninety healthy volunteers participated in this double blind randomized controlled trial comparing 3 different TAP injections performed after Cesarean delivery under spinal anesthetic: Placebo = TAP block with NaCl 0.9% (20.5ml) per side. BupTAP = TAP block with bupivacaine 0.375% (20ml) and NaCl 0.9% (0.5ml) per side. CloTAP = TAP block with bupivacaine 0.375% (20ml) and clonidine 75 mcg (0.5ml) per side. The primary outcome was the area of punctate mechanical hyperalgesia surrounding the wound per length of incision at 48 hrs (wound hyperalgesia index(WHI)). Secondary outcomes were hemodynamic parameters, pain scores, analgesic consumption and PPP at 3, 6 and 12 month assessed by the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2 (SF-MPQ2). Results and Discussion: The WHI at 48 hrs in the Placebo group was (median, 25th-75th percentiles): 1.07 (.48-3.26) vs. 1.27(.59-2.95) in the BupTAP group and lowest in the CloTAP group 0.74 (.09-2.25). These differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.59). Hemodynamic parameters, postoperative pain scores and chronic pain assessment did not differ. Incidence of breakthrough medication requests at 48 hrs was 30% in the Placebo group, 24% in the BupTAP group and 11.5% in the CloTAP group. Repeat Cesarean delivery WHI 48 hrs: Placebo group (median, 25th-75th percentiles): 1.22 (0.14-3.74) vs. 0.73 (0.51-1.32) in the BupTAP group and 0.74 (0.58-2.758) in the CloTAP group. Conclusions: Clonidine added to bupivacaine in a TAP block does not reduce 48 hrs WHI in healthy primiparous parturients. A trend in 48 hrs WHI reduction in the repeat Cesarean delivery population with high pre-operative scar hyperalgesia was observed in the BupTAP and CloTAP groups, but the study was not powered for this subgroup analysis.",English,0

We report the use of bilateral continuous paravertebral infusions to provide analgesia and facilitate ventilator weaning in a patient with a history of opioid abuse who had respiratory insufficiency and difficult-to-control pain due to blunt thoracic trauma. Case Report: The patient, an otherwise healthy 26 year-old male but for a past medical history of opioid abuse, was admitted after having been ejected during a motor vehicle crash. He sustained blunt thoracic injury with bilateral pulmonary contusions and hemopneumothoraces. Endotracheal intubation and bilateral thoracostomy tube placement were performed in the emergency department. His injuries included fractures of the right 4th through 9th and left 1st through 7th ribs, a depressed skull fracture, and grade 4 hepatic laceration with hepatic venous injury. Tracheosotomy was performed on hospital day 2. The regional anesthesia/acute pain service was consulted on hospital day 6 because of severe chest wall pain refractory to opioids causing multiple failed trials at weaning from mechanical ventilation. On the day of consultation, the patientas visual analog pain (VAS) score was 10/10 on a regimen consisting of fentanyl infusion at 100mcg/hr and intravenous patient-controlled hydromorphone (PCA) with 24-hour total consumption of 47mg. Paravertebral catheters were placed at T4 on the left and T7 on the right. 15 mL 0.5% ropivicaine bolus was injected incrementally through each catheter followed by a 0.25% lidocaine infusion at 7 mL/hr. The fentanyl infusion was stopped. Ketamine 10 mg was administered intravenously followed by continuous ketamine infusion at 10 mg/hr. Ketorolac 15 mg iv q6h for 72 h was also ordered as an adjunct. Following paravertebral blockade, the patient reported VAS scores of 1-2/10 at rest and 4/10 with activity. On hospital day 7 the patient was able to progress from assist-control to pressure-support mode of ventilation; the 24-hr hydromorphone total was 38mg. On hospital day 8, mechanical ventilation was discontinued and the patient was able to tolerate spontaneous breathing with an aerosol tracheostomy mask; the 24-hr hydromorphone total was 43mg. On hospital day 9 the hydromorphone total was 16mg and the PCA was discontinued. On hospital day 10 the TPVB paravertebral catheters were removed. Discussion: We describe the use of bilateral continuous paravertebral infusion of local anesthetic as part of a multimodal approach to provide analgesia and improve pulmonary function in a mechanically ventilated patient with multiple rib fractures and history of opioid abuse. This technique confers technical and clinical advantages over other modalities and deserves more rigorous investigation.",English,0

Small asymptomatic pneumothoraces were noted on chest X-ray in six of the 24 patients with interpleural catheters. Both types of local anaesthesia produced lower pain scores than pethidine alone (P less than 0.05) with 25% of intercostal nerve blocks and 63% of interpleural catheters requiring no pethidine in the following three hours. The provision of catheter 'top-ups' between six and 18 hours after surgery also resulted in lower pain scores and a reduction in pethidine requirements (P less than 0.05).",eng,0

Bisgaard,2006.0,Analgesic treatment after laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a critical assessment of the evidence,", ","Acute pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy is complex in nature. The pain pattern does not resemble pain after other laparoscopic procedures, suggesting that analgesic treatment might be procedure specific and multimodal. Randomized trials of analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were identified by systematic electronic literature searches (1985 to June 2005) supplemented with manual searching. The trials were categorized by well-defined criteria into high, moderate, or poor methodologic quality. Conclusions were based on trials of high and moderate methodologic quality. In total, 64 randomized analgesic trials were identified, comprising a total of 5,018 evaluated patients. The literature suggests a multimodal analgesic regimen consisting of a preoperative single dose of dexamethasone, incisional local anesthetics (at the beginning or at the end of surgery, depending on preference), and continuous treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors) during the first 3-4 days.

Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated benefits in pain control, satisfaction, and outcomes with continuous perineural techniques compared to single injection techniques.1-14 Other trials have not shown a difference in outcomes.15-18 Single shot (SS) nerve blocks are potentially easier to perform by a greater number of practitioners and may carry less risk. It is therefore important to clarify the benefits, if any, of continuous peripheral nerve blocks (cPNB) compared to SS nerve blocks. Objectives: Our purpose was to clarify whether there is benefit in pain scores, side effects, opioid use, patient satisfaction or functional outcomes with continuous peripheral nerve blocks versus single bolus nerve blocks. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all prospective, randomized trials which have compared single injection nerve blocks with a continuous technique. Methodological quality was determined independently by two reviewers. Twenty-one studies involving a total of 702 patients were eligible for analysis, Table 1. Data was extracted, meta-analyses were conducted to compare the catheter group with the standard treatment group, and mean differences between the two groups were combined using a random effects model. Results. cPNB resulted in decreased rating of worst pain compared to SS nerve blocks on POD 1 [Weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.77 , 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.43- -1.11, P 0.000], POD 2 (WMD -1.71 , 95% CI -2.92- -0.50, P 0.006) and POD 3 (WMD -0.68, 95% CI -1.26- -0.10, P 0.011), Figure 1a-d. cPNB were associated with higher patient satisfaction scores compared to SS blocks (WMD 2.04, 95% CI 1.24-2.85, P 0.000), Fig. 1e. Though several studies have compared functional outcomes5, 15, 30-33the data reported was not in sufficient quantity for meta-analysis. Watson, et al found earlier mobilization34, while White, et al and Elliot, et al reported decreased hospital LOS with a cPNB technique.6,11 Buckenmaier, et al found no statistical difference in time to return to employment or ADL.15 Salinas, et al found no difference in degrees of knee flexion at 6 or 12 weeks between groups.5 Several studies found a statistically significant decrease in opioid use for the cPNB group compared with the SS group.1-6, 11-13, 34, 35 Conclusions: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrates a statistically significant reduction in postoperative pain and an increase in patient satisfaction with the use of cPNB compared to SS techniques at all measured data points. Though there was insufficient opioid data for meta-analysis there is a trend toward decreased opioid use in the cPNB group. Although there was a statistically significant difference in VAS pain scores this might not translate to a clinically significant difference. 36 Limitations of this analysis are those inherent in all meta-analyses, including possibility for publication bias and selective outcome reporting. Future trials should focus on comparison of cost, complications and long-term functional recovery. (Table presented).",English,0

The present study evaluated the additional analgesic effect of TAP block as component of multimodal analgesia in patients undergoing unilateral laparoscopic hernia repair in an ambulatory setting. Methods: One hundred adult patients were randomized to receive standard care (S-group), including paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 50) or to undergo unilateral TAP block in addition to standard care (TAP-group) (n = 50). All patients received a general anaesthesia, with in the TAP-group unilateral TAP block using 20 ml of levobupivacaine 0.25% was associated. The visual analogue pain score (VAS) of each patient was regularly assessed from arrival in the post-anaesthesia care unit until discharge, as well as 24 h postoperatively. Other outcomes assessed were analgesic consumption and patient satisfaction. Results: The TAP-group showed no significant difference inVAS during the first 7 h postoperatively compared with the S-group. Supplemental opioid consumption was also similar in both groups (3.6 + 2.27 vs. 3.98 + 2.56). Postoperatively analgesic consumption beforedischargewas significantly lower inthe TAP-group (9vs. 2 patients, p = 0.025). After 24 h, we noted lower VAS scores in the TAP-group (14.58 + 12.66 vs. 18.9 + 14.5) but this was not statistically significant. Conclusions: The TAP block significantly reduced the need of postoperative analgesic consumption before discharge. It holds considerable promise as a part of a multimodal analgesia strategy after an elective laparoscopic unilateral hernia repair.",English,0

Our aim was to test whether using 3 different volumes of the same local anesthetic dose influences the success rate of an axillary brachial plexus block with a multiple-injection technique in patients undergoing upper limb surgery. METHODS: One hundred sixty-five patients were prospectively randomized to 1 of 3 groups. Each group received an axillary block with mepivacaine 400 mg, diluted in 3 different volumes (20, 30, and 40 mL). Outcome measures recorded were the block success rate at 30 mins, sensory and motor onset times, and length of postoperative sensory and motor blockade. RESULTS: No difference was found in the rate of successful axillary plexus blocks determined when the 30-min follow-up ended among the 3 groups: 94% for 20-mL volume, 94% for 30-mL volume, and 98% for 40-mL volume. The median sensory and motor onset times of anesthesia did not differ. However, postoperative motor blockade and sensory analgesia lasted significantly longer in the patients receiving mepivacaine 400 mg diluted in a volume of 30 mL than in the other groups.

We evaluated the analgesic efficacy of the ultrasound-guided TAP block in patients undergoing caesarean surgery. Methods: A placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised trial was performed in a tertiary maternity hospital. An ultrasoundguided TAP block was performed on 47 women undergoing elective caesarean surgery. The injectate was either 40 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine (n=23) or saline (n=24). In addition, all patients received a standard regional anaesthetic and regular paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and patientcontrolled intravenous morphine. Each patient was assessed 24 hours postoperatively for morphine usage, pain, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation and satisfaction with pain relief. Results: Compared to placebo, median total morphine use was reduced in the TAP block group from 12 mg to 6 mg, 16.5 mg to 10 mg, 25.5 mg to 16 mg and 31.5 mg to 18 mg at six, 12, 18 and 24 hours respectively (P <0.05). The active group reported improved satisfaction with their pain relief measured by visual analogue scale compared to placebo (median 96 mm vs 77 mm P=0.008). Fewerantiemetics were administered in the active group (P=0.029). There were no local complications attributable to the TAP block. Conclusions: The ultrasound-guided TAP block, as a component of a multimodal analgesic regimen, improves patient satisfaction with pain relief, reduces antiemetic usage and reduces morphine requirements after caesarean surgery.",English,0

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Plastic Surgery, Mayo Hospital, KEMU, Lahore, from January 2011 to July 2012. METHODOLOGY: Patients (n = 120) of either gender with ASA class-I and II requiring autogenous costal cartilage graft were inducted. Patients having history of local anaesthetic hypersensitivity and age < 15 years or > 60 years were excluded. Subjects were randomly assigned to pre-rib harvest (group-1) and post-rib harvest (group-2). Local anaesthetic mixture was prepared by adding 10 milliliters 2% lidocaine to 10 milliliters 0.5% bupivacaine to obtain a total 20 ml solution. Group-1 received local anaesthetic infiltration along the proposed incision lines and intercostals block before the rib harvest. Group-2 received the infiltration and block after rib harvest. Postoperative consumption of tramadol and pain scores were measured at 6 and 12 hours postoperatively using VAS. RESULTS: Mean age was 31.43 +/- 10.78 years. The mean pain scores at 6 hours postoperatively were 1.033 +/- 0.609 and 2.4667 +/- 0.812 in pre-rib harvest and post-rib harvest groups respectively (p < 0.0001). The mean pain scores at 12 hours postoperatively were 1.45 +/- 0.565 and 3.65 +/- 0.633 in pre-rib harvest and post-rib harvest groups respectively (p < 0.0001). The mean tramadol used postoperatively in first 24 hours was 169 +/- 29.24 mg and 255 +/- 17.70 mg in prerib harvest and post-rib harvest groups respectively (p < 0.0001).

Intercostal nerve blockade has been of increasing interest through the recent years as a possible alternative or supplement of epidural analgesia [1]. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of bolus doses of ropivacaine compared to continuous infusion of the same drug on postthoracotomy pain control. Method. Thirty-six male patients, aged 45-70, ASA physical status II-III, were subjected to a posterolateral thoracotomy. All patients were included in this double-blind, randomized study after written informed consent was obtained. Just before the chest closure and under direct vision, a 16G catheter was inserted adjacent to the intercostal nerve bundle. Patients were divided randomly in two groups. Group I (n=18) was scheduled to receive 0.308% ropivacaine at a standard rate of 2 mL/h, whereas Group II (n=18) received bolus doses of 16 mL 0.308% ropivacaine every 8 hours (the same total dose in 8h for both groups). In group I a pump was used for the continuous infusion in order to administer its content at the preset rate. Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia was performed following the same anaesthetic scheme in all patients and i.v. morphine was given at a standard dose 20 min before chest closure. Additional doses of pethidine were administrated during the first 48h postoperatively when needed. The catheter was removed 48h after surgery. Postoperative pain was evaluated using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS 0-10) every 6 hours. Heart rate, blood pressure, first request for pethidine as well as total pethidine consumption were recorded. ANOVA for repeated measures was performed, whereas probability P<0.05 was considered significant. Results. The 2 groups demonstrated similar demographic characteristics, heart rate and blood pressure. First analgesic requirement was recorded earlier in group II, where additional doses of pethidine were higher (P<0.05). The level of pain exceeded 6/10 in most patients of group II before the scheduled bolus dose of ropivacaine. This is a significant difference compared to group I (P<0.5), where most patients kept their pain score under 4/10 throughout most of their 48h surveillance. Discussion. With the advent of a less toxic local anaesthetic such as ropivacaine, intercostal nerve blockade becomes much safer [2]. Continuous infusion of ropivacaine seems to be superior to bolus doses, providing a more adequate state of analgesia for the patients.",English,0

Thereafter, prospective studies based on ultrasound-guided techniques described conflicting results. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the postoperative analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided TAP block. Materials and Methods: The authors searched the electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE among others. The primary endpoint was IV morphine consumption at 6h postoperatively, analysed according to the type of surgery. Secondary endpoints were IV morphine consumption at 24h postoperatively, pain scores at rest and on movement at 6 and 24h postoperatively, rates of PONV and pruritus at 24h postoperatively, and complications. Meta-analyses were performed with Review Manager software (RevMan-version-5.1.6). Results: Twenty trials were identified. Ultrasound-guided TAP block reduced cumulative IV morphine consumption at 6h postoperatively by 43% (mean difference:-4.5mg,95%CI:-6.5,-2.6mg;p<0.00001)(Figure 1).

We aimed to evaluate acute postoperative pain management in male adults randomized to receive an ultrasound-guided ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block administered before surgery, in addition to a standard analgesic regimen. METHODS: Sixty patients were included in this randomized, controlled, and double-blind study. Patients were randomized to the administration of a block with 20 mL bupivacaine 0.5% or a placebo block with 20 mL saline. The primary outcome measure was pain at mobilization in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Pain at rest, dermatomal anesthesia, time spent in the PACU/ward, opioid consumption, postoperative vomiting and nausea, ability to perform activities of daily living, and perceived ill health status were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A significant reduction in pain scores at mobilization (P<0.001) and rest (P < 0.005) was recorded in the bupivacaine group upon arrival in the PACU and again after 30 minutes. Pain at rest was similarly reduced in the bupivacaine group at the time of discharge (P < 0.017). There were significantly fewer patients (P < 0.05) with severe (numerical rating scale >5) and moderate (numerical rating scale >3) pain at mobilization and rest, respectively.

All blocks were administered following induction of intravenous anaesthesia. Pain, opioids consumed, physical ability and perceived ill health were evaluated postoperatively. Results: In the PACU, pain at rest and during mobilization was significantly reduced (p< 0.001). A significant reduction in the consumption of opioids was also observed in the PACU and at the ward (p< 0.04). Length of stay in PACU and street readiness were similar in both groups. Regrettably, at 24 and 48 hours after surgery, the effect of the USGNB did not impact the physical ability and perceived ill health status. Conclusion: USG nerve block prior to Lichtenstein operation in adults significantly reduced postoperative pain at rest and during mobilization, opioid consumption in the PACU and at the ward, but did not improvePACU length of stay, or physical ability and perceived ill health at home.

Recently, the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been studied for analgesia after CD and was effective compared to placebo [2]. The purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic efficacy of TAP block to spinal morphine after CD. Materials and Methods: In this prospective, double-blind study, six ty women undergoing elective CD were randomized to undergo either subarachnoid morphine (group SAM; n = 30) or TAP block (group TAP; n = 30). Patients received bupivacaine spinal anesthesia combined with morphine 0.1 mg in group SAM and received saline in group TAP.

Postoperative analgesia for the first 48 hours consisted of scheduled oral paracetamol and rectal ketoprofen; IV nefopam were administered up on patient request. The primary outcome was the difference in visual analog scale pain scores at rest and on movement during the first 48 postoperative hours. Other outcomes assessed were first analgesic request, analgesic consumption, maternal satisfaction, and incidence of adverse effects. Results and Discussion: The demographic characteristics were similar in both groups. The mean visual analog scale pain scores at rest and on movement until 48 postoperative hours were not different between the 2 groups. Median (range) time to first analgesic request was similar in both groups 24 (12-48) hours in group SAM versus 24 (2-48) hours in group TAP; (P>0.05).

This study was designed to determine whether paravertebral nerve block using bupivacaine infused through a catheter placed intraoperatively, can reduce postoperative pain, and analgesia requirements after loin incision. METHODS: Thirty-four patients undergoing renal surgery through loin incision at Jordan University Hospital, Amman, Jordan, from October 2001 to March 2003, were randomized either to receive bupivacaine 0.5% or normal saline through a catheter positioned intraoperatively against the costovertebral joints in the paravertebral space. The infusions were continued until the evening of the third postoperative day. Patients had access on request to intramuscular Morphine sulphate 5-15 mg, or Diclofenac sodium 50-100 mg, or both depending on body weight. Pain after operation was assessed at rest using linear visual analogue scale. Patient scores were recorded in the recovery room, at 4 hours, 8 hours, and at 9 am, and 5 pm. RESULTS: The analgesia requirements for each patient were recorded. Pain scores in the recovery room were significantly lower in the bupivacaine group (mean 4.5 versus 8.0, p=0.001). At 4 hours, the pain score was lower in the bupivacaine group though not significant (mean 3.5 versus 4.37, p=0.393). Thereafter, the pain scores were significantly lower in the bupivacaine group. Mean morphine requirement in the bupivacaine group was 13.3 mg (ranges 0-50), while in the saline group 40.13 mg (range 10-112.5), p<0.001.

Gautschi,1991.0,Intercostal nerve block for minor breast surgery,", ","Two anesthetic procedures, intercostal nerve block (ICNB) and general anesthesia, were evaluated in 45 female patients scheduled for minor breast surgery. The study was designed to compare ICNB with general anesthesia for breast surgery with respect to efficacy, surgical stress and postoperative analgesia and to evaluate epinephrine and ornipressin as vasoconstrictors in the local anesthetic solution. Thirty patients received ICNB of T3-T7 unilaterally using 2% lidocaine plus epinephrine (15 patients, Group A) and 2% lidocaine plus ornipressin (15 patients, Group B). The control group consisted of 15 patients receiving a general anesthetic. The highest median lidocaine plasma level was 2.8 micrograms/ml in those patients who received epinephrine and 5.3 micrograms/ml in those who received ornipressin. There were statistically significantly higher lidocaine plasma levels in Group B than in Group A after 10, 30 and 60 minutes from injection while the two groups did not differ significantly at the 20- and 90-minute time intervals. Before and during surgery, epinephrine and norepinephrine plasma levels were highest in the epinephrine group, whereas, postoperatively, the plasma levels of both catecholamines were highest in the patients receiving general anesthesia. The latter patients experienced significantly more nausea and vomiting than the regional anesthesia groups. Patients with regional anesthesia required significantly less analgesics postoperatively than the patients receiving general anesthesia.",eng,0

Study design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: We scheduled 40 patients divided into two groups to receive either 20 ml bupivacaine (0.5%) incremental injections for intra and postoperative analgesia via a catheter inserted in the thoracic paravertebral space. The other 20 patients received systemic morphine for postoperative analgesia. We recorded postoperative Visual Analog Scale pain score, total morphine consumption, time to first analgesic request, changes in pulmonary functions and side effects. Results: Visual analogue scale (VAS) at rest was lower in the paravertebral group at all measurement points except at 16, 20 and 24 h postoperatively. Pain on coughing showed significant difference (P value < 0.05) at 8 and 16 h but not at 24 h. Post-operative consumption of morphine was 36 (22-42) mg in the control group versus 9 (2-22) mg in the paravertebral block group (PVB) (P value = 0.003). Total bupivacaine dose used in the PVB group in the first 24 h was 300-420 mg. For time to first analgesic request it was significantly longer in the morphine group than the paravertebral block group. VAS at first analgesic request was not statistically different between the two groups. There was no significant difference between the two groups as regards to peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) preoperatively, after 12 h or 24 h. There was a significant reduction in the incidence of side effects in the TPVB group compared to morphine group concerning vomiting and pruritus.no local anesthetic toxicity was reported. Conclusion: We conclude that thoracic PVB provides effective post thoracotomy analgesia supported by lower VAS pain scores at rest and on coughing compared to intravenous morphine with significant less incidence of side effects. 2011 Egyptian Society of Anesthesiologists.

Fifty children, ASA I, aged 7-12 years undergoing elective superficial lower limb surgery of short duration were randomly designated to receive either nerve blocks performed with 0.25% bupivacaine (group I, n = 27) or 0.1 mg/kg of intravenous morphine (group II, n = 23), under light GA. Non invasive BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, concentration of halothane used and clinical response to noxious stimuli were noted intraoperatively. Postoperative recovery, severity of pain (visual analogue scale), rescue analgesic requirement and complications if any, were recorded in both the groups for a period of 8 hrs. The results of present study showed significantly greater haemodynamic stability and pain relief in group I, both intra and postoperatively (p < 0.001). The incidence of postoperative complications i.e. vomiting, shivering and salivation were also significantly lesser in group I. In conclusion, nerve blocks by Brown's technique in supplementation to light GA are superior to morphine (0.1 mg/kg) supplemented with light GA for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia in children undergoing superficial lower limb surgery of short duration.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-seven patients underwent elective hemorrhoidectomy. Of these, 33 were randomly allocated to receive spinal anesthesia (SA) while 34 received perianal local analgesia (LA) with bupivacaine. Pain measurement at 6 and 24 hours following hemorrhoidectomy, the quantity of postoperative analgesic medication administered, patient's satisfaction and complications were recorded. RESULTS: Among the patients who had SA, there were 5 patients (15.2%) who developed hypotension during surgery. There was no reported case of hypotension among those who had LA. There was no significant difference in degree of median postoperative pain at 6 hours (LA: 38 vs. SA: 50 with VAS; p = 0.09) and at 24 hours (LA: 31 vs. SA: 35 with VAS; p = 0.35) between the two groups.

Ultrasound guided thoracic paravertebral block is a recent technique which may offer several advantages. We therefore evaluated the analgesic effects of both bocks. Methods: We randomized 30 patients undergoing elective thoracotomy to two groups: thoracic epidural group (TED) and ultrasound guided thoracic paravertebral group (TPV). During early postoperative 72 h, we measured pain intensity, intravenous fentanyl consumption by patient controlled analgesia pump, spirometric tests, arterial blood gas analysis and complications. Results: Analgesic quality was comparable in both groups with a higher consumption of fentanyl in ultrasound guided TPV group. Spirometric tests were comparable between both groups except forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second at 24h which was more favorable in TED group. Values of vital parameters (SpO2%, respiratory rate, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure) were comparable in both groups. Perforation of the pleura was reported in one patient who belongs to the TPV group. Conclusion: TPVB is a suitable alternative to epidural analgesia for pain management following thoracotomy and it can provide proper anesthesia and analgesia in patients with severe comorbidities and contraindications to neuroaxial blocks... Despite the use of ultrasound guided, puncture of the pleura is still a possible complication.",English,0

They may in turn lead to other complications such as wound damage. On the other hand, the use of opioid analgesics has unwanted effects on patients. This study evaluated the effects of intravenous infusion of lidocaine on the need for anesthetics during the operation and analgesics after the operation in patients undergoing ophthalmologic surgeries. Methods: This clinical trial study was performed in Feiz Hospital (Isfahan, Iran) during 2011. Overall, 80 patients who were scheduled for eye surgery under general anesthesia were selected and randomly allocated to two groups to be infused with either intravenous lidocaine or placebo during the operation. Pain, nausea, and vomiting were assessed every 15 minutes in the recovery room. Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to measure the mentioned parameters. Finally, the collected data was analyzed with SPSS. Findings: The mean dose of analgesics in the lidocaine and placebo groups was 6.25 +; 11.00 and 9.65 +1; 14.5 mg/kg, respectively (P = 0.22). Based on the VAS, the intensity of vomiting was 1.09 +1; 2.70 in the lidocaine group and 1.75 +; 3.60 in the placebo group (P > 0.05). Conclusion: According to our findings, intravenous administration of lidocaine during eye surgeries cannot effectively reduce pain and postoperative complications. However, since it decreased the need for anesthetics during the operation, it can be recommended for ophthalmologic surgeries under general anesthesia.

Administration of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) after minor surgery often gives satisfactory level of PO comfort, but their use may lead to some adverse effects. Applying of epidural block in these patients may lead to complications related to anesthesia itself. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a newly described peripheral block involving the nerves of the anterior abdominal wall. The results of clinical trials with TAP block are encouraging. Methods and results. Overall 23 pediatric patients were randomized into TAP group (n=11) and NSAIDs group (n=12). In TAP group 0.6ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine was injected into transversus abdominis plane in a blind manner (two pops) via triangle of Petit immediately after surgery. Patients of NSAIDs group received ketoprofen 0.5mg/kg at induction of anesthesia and 3mg/kg/day after surgery. Mean Visual Analog Scale values were significantly better in TAP group then in NSAIDs group (1.3+0.4 vs. 3.4+0.6, p<0.05).

METHODS: In 30 scheduled patients for unilateral hand or forearm surgery, an axillary brachial plexus block with ""selective"" injection of nerves and continuous catheter technique was performed with 40 ml of 2.5 mg/ml of bupivacaine, or levobupivacaine. After catheter placement, motor and sensory block were scored, and the patient was interviwed in the postoperative first 24 hours. The postoperative first analgesic need, total analgesic needs, pain scale and side-effects were registered. RESULTS: At the 30th min, complete sensory block was more frequent in the inervation area of the median nerve in the Bupivacaine group than Levobopivacaine group, and in the Bupivacaine group, complete sensory block was more frequent in the inervation area of the median nerve than the other nerves (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, partial motor block of radial nevre was more frequent in the levobupivacaine group (P < 0.05). Tourniquet was well tolerated in all patients with successful block in both groups. Mean duration of analgesia was similar to the bupivacaine and levobupivacaine groups at 14.2 h, and 18.4 h, respectively (NS).

A preoperative skull block may reduce hemodynamic fluctuations and hypo- or hyperventilation due to emergence delirium or oversedation and provide adequate pain relief, thereby reducing postoperative morbidity. METHODS: Pediatric patients (age 3-13 years) undergoing EDAMS surgery for moyamoya disease were randomly divided into a nerve block (NB) group (18 cases) or control group (21 cases). The treatment group patients received a preoperative NB (0.25% 5-8 ml bupivacaine mixed with 20-40 mg methylprednisolone) targeting the supraorbital, supratrochlear, auriculotemporal, and posterior auricular nerves. Patients in the control group did not receive NB. General anesthesia with sevoflurane was induced in both groups. RESULTS: In the NB group, stable hemodynamic parameters were obtained with a lower sevoflurane concentration than in the control group. For delirious awakening, the odds ratio in the control group was 4.9 compared with the NB group. Pain and analgesic requirement were higher in the control patients than in the NB-treated patients during the postanesthesia care unit stay. However, the arterial CO(2) tension in the postanesthesia care unit did not differ between the 2 groups. The odds ratio in the control group for the rate of morbidity (cerebral infarction and reversible ischemic neurological deficits) during the first 24 hours following the operation was 3.2 compared with the NB group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of skull block during EDAMS surgery provided easy hemodynamic control, calm awakening, and better pain relief and may be related to the reduced postoperative morbidity.",eng,0

To determine whether continuous pleural analgesia offers better postoperative pain relief than does bolus administration in postcholecystectomy patients. Methods. Eighty postcholecystectomy patients with a subcostal incision were randomly allocated to receive pleural analgesia with either a bolus regime of 20 ml 0.375% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine at four-hour intervals (bolus group), or a loading dose of 20 ml 0.375% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine immediately followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 6 ml/hour during the first 24 hours postoperatively (infusion group). A 10-cm linear visual analog scale was used and recorded before performing pleural analgesia and at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours subsequently. Plasma levels of bupivacaine were determined in eight patients of the infusion group. Samples were taken at 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes and at 6 and 18 hours after the start of infusion. Results. Mean visual analog scale values were significantly lower (p < 0.001) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours in the infusion group. PaCO<sub>2</sub> decreased significantly (p < 0.001) after the block in both groups, with no difference between the groups. Plasma levels were well below toxic levels in the infusion group.

Does the type of analgesia in ERP patients undergoing laparoscopic colo-rectal resections affect pain scores ? Methods: Following local ethics approval data was collected by the acute pain service for the first two post operative days. We looked at pain scores in patients undergoing laparoscopic right hemicolectomy or anterior resection during a 24 month period. ( n= 155) Result: Our data illustrates that epidural analgesia doesnot provide significantly better analgesia in ERP patients undergoing laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (High = 2.0 Low = 1.0 . 95 % confidence interval for mean (p= 0.81) ) ERP patients undergoing laparoscopic anterior resection have significantly better pain scores with epidural analgesia compared with PCA (High = 2.0 Low = 1.0 95 % confidence interval for mean( p=0.054)) Conclusions: A meta analysis of five studies showed no difference in time to tolerate normal diet, return of bowel function and post operative complications in ERP patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resections between those receiving IV morphine and those receiving epidural analgesia. Pain control in this study however was superior in the epidural group, but no distinction was made between left and right sided surgery. Our data shows that epidural analgesia does not result in significantly superior pain scores in ERP patients undergoing right sided laparoscopic colorectal surgery compared with PCA analgesia,whereas the opposite is true for anterior resections.

METHODS: We planned to enroll 200 patients scheduled for various cardiac surgical procedures into the study. Patients, in a double-blind randomized fashion, were given either normal saline or 0.3% ropivacaine through 2 subcutaneous multiport catheters placed on either side of the sternal split at an infusion rate of 4 mL/h for 64 hours. The efficacy outcomes measured were time to extubation of the trachea, intensive care unit and hospital stay duration, pain scores, and narcotic usage. The safety outcomes measured were systemic local anesthetic toxicity, major cardiac complications, and wound infection. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The data safety monitoring board stopped the study after enrolling 85 patients because of excessive sternal wound infections (9%, n = 44) in the ropivacaine group. This rate of infection was not statistically different from the control group (0%, n = 41, P = 0.12), but it was statistically different from our historical incidence of sternal wound infection (1.9%, no = 6381, P = 0.002). There was also a lack of evidence of efficacy for time to extubation of the trachea, narcotic usage, and pain control.

Iliohypogastric-ilioinguinal (IHII) nerve block reduces postoperative pain after herniorrhaphy, The effect of preemptive intramuscular injection of 0.1mg/kg of morphine was studied in ambulatory surgery for patients undergoing unilateral varicocoelectomy and the results were compared with those of IHII nerve block. Methods: This study was performed at Jordan University Hospital, Amman, Jordan, between August 2005 and December 2006. After obtaining the approval of the ethical committee, an informed consent was taken from 68 adult male patients in ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologist) who are I-II scheduled for unilateral varicocoelectomy. Those patients were included in a prospective, randomized, double blind study. 34 patients have received IHII nerve block 10 minutes before the incision with 20 mls of bupivacaine 0.5%) (B group), and 34 patients received 0.1mg/kg of morphine 10 minutes also before the incision (M group). All patients have received standardized anesthesia, pain was assessed by 0-10 (VAS) Visual Analogue Score at 0, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, post operative hours. The incidences of nausea, vomiting, sedation, itching and additional analgesic requirement were assessed. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Iliohypogastric-ilioinguinal nerve block group reported lower postoperative pain scores at 30 minutes P=0.00255, 1 hour P=0.0001, 2 hours P=0.0103.No significant differences were present between the two groups at 3 and 4 hours postoperatively. The incidence of sedation, nausea, vomiting and itching was similar in both groups (p=NS). Conclusion: Iliohypogastric- ilioinguinal nerve block for unilateral ambulatory varicocoelectomy can reduce pain more than morphine in the immediate postoperative period, but this reduction was not associated with a reduction in opioid related side effects. 2008 DAR Publishers/ University of Jordan.

Interestingly, complete field block can be approached endoscopically with minimal hazards. The objective of this prospective randomized study was to compare the outcome of two different approaches of inguinal field block (IFB) for postoperative pain control following endoscopic total extra-peritoneal laparoscopic (TEP) inguinal hernioplasty. Methods: Eighty male patients, underwent unilateral endoscopic TEP hernioplasties, were randomized to receive either preoperative percutaneous IFB (group A, n=40) or intraoperative endoscopic IFB (group B, n=40); using 40 ml of levobupivacaine (0.25%), Postoperative pain was assessed by visual analogue score, VAS on a scale from 0 to 10. The intraoperative anaesthetic requirements, time from end of surgery till extubation, postoperative narcotic analgesia requirement; length of hospital stay and return to full activity were compared between the two groups. Results: A comparison between the two study groups showed that patients in group A had significantly less requirements of intraoperative fentanyl analgesia 65.2 (16.8) mug and shorter recovery time 7.3 (1.7) min. than patients in group B 98.4 (27.9) mug and 8.4(2) min. Postoperative pain scores were higher in group A in the first 4-6 hours (p=ns), Postoperative IV morphine requirement was significantly higher in the first 12 hours (Day surgery cases) in group A 13.2 (3) mg than in group B 9.2 (2.5) mg, This difference was not significant among patients hospitalized within the next 24 hours. Almost one third of the patients were able to go home on the same day of surgery (11 in group A and 15 in group B, p=ns). Conclusion: We conclude that inguinal field block for TEP hernioplasty provide merits for the patients regarding the postoperative pain control and short hospital stay. However, endoscopic IFB was shown to have better control of postoperative pain than the percutaneous IFB during the first 12 hours.",English,0

Randomized controlled trial,", http://ovidsp.ovid.com/athens?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=emed11&AN=71378178","Background: Current evidence associates tumor recurrence and metastasis with postoperative pain,1 surgical stress,2-5 inhalational anesthetics,6-8 and opioid use.6, 9-11 Consequently, regional anesthesia techniques are advocated12-15 for tumor resection surgery as they effectively treat surgical pain,16 attenuate the neuroendocrine stress response,17 and minimize the use of general anesthetics and opioids. This study examines the effects of using an inhalational gas-and opioid-free anesthetic technique that relies on total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and thoracic paravertebral blocks (PVBs) on the quality of recovery (QoR) following ambulatory breast tumor resection. Methods: Sixty-six adult females undergoing breast tumor resection surgery were randomized to receive a standardized general anesthetic regimen inclusive of sevoflurane, fentanyl, and morphine (General Group) or a combination of PVBs and propofol-based anesthesia (PVB Group). The PVB group received 5mL of ropivacaine 0.5% in each of the T1-T5 paravertebral spaces on the operative side using an out-of-plane parasagittal technique.18 The General group received five-level sham blocks with subcutaneous saline. QoR was assessed before discharge and on postoperative day (POD) 2 using the QoR questionnaire.7 Secondary outcomes including pain scores on admission and discharge from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), discharge from hospital, and POD2; intra-and postoperative opioid consumption; time to first analgesic request; incidence of nausea and vomiting (PONV); patient satisfaction; and discharge time were assessed. Results: Data from sixty-four patients was analyzed. Patient demographics were similar between groups (Table 1). The QoR score before discharge and on POD2 was superior in the PVB group; 146(143-149) and 144(141-149) versus 131(126-135); P< 0.0001 and 138(131-145); P= 0.013, respectively in the General group (Figure 1). Pain scores were also lower in the PVB group on admission and discharge from PACU, discharge from hospital, and on POD2 (Figure 2). Intraoperative morphine consumption, incidence of PONV, and discharge time were lower in the PVB group (Table 2). The groups did not differ in postoperative morphine consumption, time to first analgesic request, and patient satisfaction. Conclusion: Combining propofol-based general anesthesia and PVBs provides superior quality of recovery, analgesia, and shorter discharge time than an inhalational and opioid-based anesthesia in patients undergoing ambulatory breast tumor resection.

Brull,2012.0,Transversus abdominis plane block: a systematic review,10.1097/AAP.0b013e3182429531,"Ultrasound guidance has led a surge of interest in transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block for postoperative analgesia following abdominal surgery. Despite or because of the numerous descriptive applications and techniques that have recently populated the literature, results of comparative studies for TAP block have been inconsistent. This systematic review pragmatically addresses many unanswered questions, specifically the following: what are the effects of surgical procedure, block dose, block technique, and block timing on TAP block analgesia? Eighteen intermediate- to good-quality randomized trials that included diverse surgical procedures were identified. Improved analgesia was noted in patients undergoing laparotomy for colorectal surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and open and laparoscopic appendectomy. There was a trend toward superior analgesic outcomes when 15 mL of local anesthetic or more was used per side compared with lesser volumes. All 5 trials investigating TAP block performed in the triangle of Petit and 7 of 12 trials performed along the midaxillary line demonstrated some analgesic advantages. Eight of 9 trials using preincisional TAP block and 4 of 9 with postincisional block revealed better analgesic outcomes. Although the majority of trials reviewed suggest superior early pain control, we were unable to definitively identify the surgical procedures, dosing, techniques, and timing that provide optimal analgesia following TAP block. This review suggests that our understanding of the TAP block and its role in contemporary practice remains limited.",eng,0

Therefore, we sought to investigate the efficacy of a continuous infusion of Bupivacaine 0.5%, at the median sternotomy site, for 48 hours after cardiac surgery in reducing the opioid analgesic requirement and improving the recovery process. Methods-In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, 36 consenting patients undergoing open heart surgery with a standardized general anesthetic technique had two indwelling infusion catheters placed at the median sternotomy incision site at the end of surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to receive normal saline (control), Bupivacaine 0.5% via an elastomeric infusion pump at a constant rate of 4 ml/h for 48 hours. In addition, the postoperative opioid analgesic requirements and opioid-related adverse effects were recorded. The patients satisfaction with their pain management was assessed at specific intervals during the postoperative period. Duration of mechanical ventilation and time of ventilation were assessed in the two groups. Results-Compared with the control group, there was a statistically significant reduction in ambulatory time 13.7+/-2.5 vs. 16.5+/-4.6 hours (P=0.03). Hospital stay was also shorter in the case group (5+/-0.6 vs. 6.1+/-0.9 with P= 0.01). Extubation time and ICU stay were not statistically significant (P= 0.93 for extubation time and P=0.70 for duration of ICU stay), and also patient satisfaction in the two groups was not statistically significant. Opioid dose, used in the case group, was 1.1+/-0.8 and in the control group was 3.7+/-1.3, with the difference being statistically important (P = 0.02). Conclusion-A continuous infusion of Bupivacaine 0.5% at 4 ml/h is effective for decreasing pain and the need for opioid analgesic medication as well as for improving patient satisfaction with pain management after cardiac surgery. Patients in the Bupivacaine-0.5% group were able to ambulate earlier, leading to a reduced length of hospital stay.""",English,0

Methods: 20 adult females were randomly allocated into 2 equal groups (n=10): TEA group received titrated dose of 8-10 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine through the catheter. In GA group, sevoflurane, rocuronium,and N<sub>2</sub>O 50% in oxygen were used for maintenance of anesthesia. Postoperative (PO) pain during the first 24 h, in TEA group was controlled by continuous infusion of 4-6 ml/h of 0.2% ropivacaine; while in GA group was controlled by intramuscular meperidine 50-100 mg 6-hourly. PACU discharge was determined using modified Aldrete score and home readiness (score=9) was evaluated using a modified post-anesthesia discharge scoring system. Patients' satisfaction with the anesthetic technique was scaled on a 7-point scale. Results: TEA provided nearly stable systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR); percentage of change of SBP was +11.7% and +28% in TEA and GA groups, respectively, with significantly higher SBP measures with GA compared to TEA. TEA provided significantly lower pain VAS scores, prolonged duration of analgesia and reduced consumption of rescue analgesia. Number of patients achieved a score indicating home-ready was significantly higher in TEA group compared to GA group. Mean patients' satisfaction score significantly higher with TEA because of good pain control, early ambulation and shorter hospital stay. Conclusion: It could be concluded that TEA during reduction mammoplasty provided effective anesthesia, better PO pain relief, faster anesthetic recovery, early home return and greater patient satisfaction than general anesthesia.",English,0

METHODS: Consenting adults scheduled to undergo laparoscopic TEP repair of unilateral inguinal hernias were recruited to this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of 0.25% bupivacaine (Group I) versus saline (Group II) infiltration of abdominal wounds and the extraperitoneal space. Pain scores were assessed at 4 and 24 hours postoperatively using the short-form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ), the Present Pain Index (PPI) score and the visual analogue scale (VAS). The intravenous and oral analgesic requirements were recorded. Each patient completed questionnaire to assess their satisfaction with the postoperative analgesia. RESULTS: 40 patients were randomized (Group I, n = 20; Group II, n = 20). The two groups were comparable for age, gender, body mass index, and operating time. Minor complications occurred in one patient in each group. There were no significant differences in the postoperative SF-MPQ scores, PPI and VAS at 4 hours (p = 0.413, p = 0.631, p = 0.615 respectively) and 24 hours (p = 0.116, p = 0.310, p = 0.100 respectively) post-operatively.

Sciatic nerve blocks with long-acting local anesthetics have been recommended for surgical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia. However, a novel percutaneous approach may require less analgesia and make the procedure suitable for ambulatory care. We thus tested the hypothesis that mid-foot block and sciatic nerve blocks provide comparable surgical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia, but that patients ambulate independently sooner after mid-foot block. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized study. METHODS: Forty patients scheduled for ambulatory percutaneous hallux valgus repair were randomly assigned to two anesthesia and analgesia blocks: foot infiltration achieved by a mild foot block, or sciatic nerve block (30mL of 7.5% ropivacaine for each block). Surgery was performed without sedation or additional analgesia. Both groups were given oral paracetamol/codeine and ketoprofene systematically; tramadol was added if necessary. Walking ability and pain scores were assessed for 48 postoperative hours. RESULTS: Demographic and morphometric characteristics, and duration of surgery were similar in each group. Pain scores were comparable and low in each group at rest and while walking. The time to ambulation without assistance was significantly less for patients in the infiltration group (3.8+/-1.4hours) than patients in the sciatic group (19.2+/-9.5hours; P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: After percutaneous hallux valgus repair, mid-foot block and sciatic nerve block provided comparable postoperative analgesia. However, mid-foot block seems preferable since the time to ambulation without assistance is much reduced.",eng,0

Methodology: In a randomized clinical trial, 62 patients selected for unilateral mastectomy were recruited in Tabriz Imam Reza educational Hospital during 18-month period. They were randomly divided into two equal groups; receiving either preincisional ipsilateral stellate ganglion block using bupivacaine (study group) or without these blocks (control group). Postoperative pain was evaluated based on visual analogue scale (VAS). The total dose of analgesics were also compared between the two groups. Results: Thirty one female patients with a mean age of 48.7+7.4 (36-60) years and 31 other female patients with a mean age of 50.7+6.9 (36-60) years were enrolled in the study and control groups, respectively (p=0.292). The number of patients with decrease in postoperative pain was significantly higher in the case study group comparing with that of the control group (p<0.001). Decrease in total dose of postoperative analgesics was also significantly lower in the case study group compared with control group (P<0.001). Forty eight hours after operation, there were 15 pain-free patients in the study group with no pain-free patients in the control group. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). Conclusion: Based on our findings, the preincisional ipsilateral stellate ganglion block is an effective method in controlling the postoperative pain after unilateral mastectomy. This approach had also got a considerable analgesic-sparing effect.",English,1

Design: Prospective randomized trial (Canadian Task Force classification I). Setting: University teaching hospital. Patients: Eighty-four women who underwent outpatient hysteroscopy for evaluation of the uterine cavity at McGill University Health Center. Interventions: Randomization to local intracervical or combined local and paracervical anesthesia. Measurements and main results: Amount of pain experienced during the procedure and at 10, 30, and 60 minutes after the procedure was measured using a visual analog scale ranging from zero to 10 (zero = no pain; 10 = excruciating pain). The mean age of the patients in the local anesthesia group was 36.1 + 0.7 years and in the combined local and paracervical anesthesia group was 35.2 + 0.7 years. Patients experienced significantly more pain during than after the procedure. The mean pain scores in the local anesthesia group were significantly higher than in the combined anesthesia group during the procedure (3.2 + 0.3 vs 2.1 + 0.2; p <.01; 95% CI 0-2), 10 minutes after the procedure (1.9 + 0.2 vs 1.5 + 0.3; p = .03; 95% CI 0-1), and 30 minutes after the procedure (1.7 + 0.2 vs 1.0 + 0.2; p = .02; 95% CI 0-1).

In this trial, the efficacy of addition of clonidine to bupivacaine used in lumbar plexus block (LPB) was evaluated. Patients and methods: Sixty ASA I or II adult patients undergoing hip surgery, receiving general anesthesia, were randomly allocated to three equal sized groups, according to the technique of postoperative analgesia. In group A patients extubated when they met the standard extubation criteria. In group B, a mixed solution of 15 mL bupivacaine 0.5% and 15 mL normal saline 0.9% was injected through lumbar plexus block technique before extubation. In group C, 2.5 lg/ml clonidine was added to bupivacaine. Postoperative pain, sedation, hemodynamics, analgesic consumption, local anesthetic side effects and serum cortisol level were compared. Results: There was a highly significant statistical difference between the three groups as regards the postoperative VAS scores (P < 0.001). In contrast to group A patients, VAS remained < 50 mm till the 6th hour postoperatively in group B patients and till the 12th hour in group C with high significant difference in postoperative morphine consumption (P < 0.001). Hemodynamics and respiratory rate were in normal range 2 h postoperatively in the three groups. After the 6th hour postoperatively; SBP, DBP, HR and RR were significantly higher in group A patients in comparison to groups B and C (P < 0.05). In group C patients; SBP, DBP, HR and RR were in normal range for the first 12 h postoperatively. Blood cortisol level was higher then normal in group A patients since 2 h postoperatively (P, 0.05), while started to rise from the 6th hour in group B patients and the 12th hour in group C patients. Conclusion: The study showed that posterior lumbar plexus block was an effective postoperative analgesic technique in patients undergoing hip surgeries and that adding clonidine in a concentration of 2.5 lg/ml to bupivacaine 0.25% has resulted in decreasing the postoperative analgesic requirements. 2011 Egyptian Society of Anesthesiologists.

Thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) is carried out successfully for pain management after breast surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of PVB in women undergoing breast surgery. Materials and methods: This prospective, randomized, comparative, single-blind study was conducted after approval by the local ethics committee. Forty patients who underwent radical mastectomy were included in the study after informed consent according to the following criteria: Age> 20 and >65 years, ASA class I or II. The non-inclusion criteria were: refusal of the patient, infection of the injection site, bleeding disorder, BMI> 35, hypersensitivity to local anesthetics, chronic analgesics or antiemetic treatment. Exclusion criteria were: anesthetic complications and technical difficulties. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: G1 (n = 20): 1.5mg/kg of bupivacaine 0.5% for metameric T4 into the paravertebral space and G2 (n = 20): did not have paravertebral block. Complementary analgesia by paracetamol and morphine was administered to both groups. We found the VAS at rest and in motion at 1, 2, 3, 9, 12 and 24 hours after surgery, the first analgesic request, the incidence of nausea and vomiting and adverse effects of paravertebral block. Results: Demographic characteristics and duration of the intervention were comparable between the 2 groups. The average VAS at rest and movement were lower in group 1 up to 24 hours after surgery. The median (range) time of the first analgesic request was 94.5 minutes for group 1 versus 25.5 minutes for group 2, P>0.05. The amount of morphine in SSPI was lower in group 1 (2.05 + 0.22 mg vs 5.35 + 2.11 mg, P >0.001). The consumption of analgesics in 24 hours was significantly lower in the paravertebral block group. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1. There were no complications associated with the implementation of the paravertebral block. DISCUSSION : As part of a multimodal analgesia, paravertebral nerve blocks can provide excellent postoperative analgesic pain relief with less adverse effects and could also reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting.",English,0

We evaluated the available evidence comparing caudal blockade to alternative analgesic strategies in achieving post-operative analgesia. METHODS: A systematic review of prospective studies comparing analgesic practices for open unilateral pediatric IHR was performed by searching Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library from 1950-2011. Articles were critically appraised and included if adequate description of experimental (caudal) and control (nerve blockade or wound infiltration) groups were performed. Pain scores were standardized and evaluated 1 hour after procedure as was the need for rescue analgesia using REVMAN. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy articles were identified via our search strategy, thirteen of which were included for analysis. Articles identified were all single-institution, generally small (mean N=29 subjects/arm) and of poor quality (median Jadad score: 2). There was no significant difference in pain scores (-0.09, 95% CI: -0.32, 0.13, p=0.41) or the need for rescue analgesia (0.80, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.13, p=0.46). CONCLUSION: There is no demonstrable difference in post-operative pain scores or rescue analgesia when comparing caudal blockade with alternative pain management strategies after pediatric IHR. This equipoise suggests that caudal blockade may be obviated for lower risk and less time-consuming maneuvers in patients barring supplementary indications for pain control.",eng,1

Measures of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), vital capacity (VC), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), PaO2, and incidence of atelectasis, pulmonary infection, and pulmonary complications overall were analyzed. Compared with systemic opioids, epidural opioids decreased the incidence of atelectasis (risk ratio [RR] 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33-0.85) and had a weak tendency to reduce the incidence of pulmonary infections (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.18-1.53) and pulmonary complications overall (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.20-1.33). Epidural local anesthetics increased PaO2 (difference 4.56 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.058-9.075) and decreased the incidence of pulmonary infections (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21-0.65) and pulmonary complications overall (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.80) compared with systemic opioids. Intercostal nerve blockade tends to improve pulmonary outcome measures (incidence of atelectasis: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.27-1.57, incidence of pulmonary complications overall: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.18-1.22), but these differences did not achieve statistical significance. There were no clinically or statistically significant differences in the surrogate measures of pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC, and PEFR). These analyses support the utility of epidural analgesia for reducing postoperative pulmonary morbidity but do not support the use of surrogate measures of pulmonary outcome as predictors or determinants of pulmonary morbidity in postoperative patients. IMPLICATIONS: When individual trials are unable to produce significant results, it is often because of insufficient patient numbers. It may be impossible for a single institution to study enough patients. Meta-analysis is a useful tool for combining the data from multiple trials to increase the patient numbers. These meta-analyses confirm that postoperative epidural pain control can significantly decrease the incidence of pulmonary morbidity.",eng,0
Journal Article,R. A. Bays; L. Barry; P. Vasilenko,1991.0,The use of bupivacaine in elective inguinal herniorrhaphy as a fast and safe technique for relief of postoperative pain,", ","The intraoperative use of local anesthetic agents to decrease postoperative pain has been used in many types of procedures. Most of these techniques involve needle injection of anesthetic and result in a low but troublesome incidence of complications. In this study, we evaluated the reliability, safety, and efficacy of a technique emphasizing bathing of tissues with anesthetic rather than needle injection for relieving postoperative pain. Thirty consecutive patients undergoing outpatient elective inguinal herniorrhaphy with general anesthetic were prospectively randomized into four treatment groups. Group 1 received 0.5 per cent bupivacaine plus epinephrine 1 to 200,000; group 2, 0.5 per cent bupivacaine; group 3, normal saline solution, and group 4, no treatment. At the end of the repair, one-third of the test solution (approximately 5 milliliters) was bathed along the spermatic cord throughout its length in the inguinal canal. The external oblique aponeurosis was closed superficial to the cord structures and another one-third of the solution was instilled into the wound. Just prior to the end of skin closure the remaining solution was instilled subcutaneously. No needles were used to instill the solutions and they were not suctioned or removed from the wound. Data collection consisted of an analog type of patient questionnaire allowing subjective assessment of postoperative pain at various time intervals during the first 20 hours postoperatively. Pain medication provided was propoxyphene, 100 milligrams and acetaminophen, 650 milligrams every three hours as needed. Total doses of pain medication for the study period and the time to first pain medication requirement were obtained. Results were analyzed using analysis of variance, and Wilcoxon ranked sums test. Patients in group 1 (0.5 per cent bupivacaine with epinephrine) exhibited significantly less pain than those in groups 3 (saline solution) and 4 (control) for more than 12 hours postoperatively. Patients in group 2 (0.5 per cent bupivacaine) likewise experienced less pain than those in groups 3 and 4 through seven hours. The patients receiving saline solution were not significantly different than those in the control group throughout. Objectively, groups 1 and 2 required fewer total doses of pain medication and waited longer before requesting oral pain medication postoperatively compared with those in the control group. No complications occurred that could be attributed to the technique. The results of this study indicate that the bathing of wounds with 0.5 per cent bupivacaine with or without epinephrine 1:200,000 is a safe and effective method of decreasing postoperative pain for several hours in patients undergoing elective inguinal herniorrhaphy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",eng,0

METHODS: A multi-level technique for performing the nerve block with bupivacaine was developed and then utilized in this two-part study. Part one was a retrospective assessment of Cesarean delivery patients with and without ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric blocks to determine if the technique reduced patient controlled analgesia morphine use and thus would warrant further study. The second phase was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to compare post-Cesarean morphine use and the appearance of opioid-related side effects between the anesthetic and placebo-injected groups. RESULTS: Both phases demonstrated that our method of ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block significantly reduced the amount of iv morphine used by patients during the 24 hr following Cesarean delivery. In the retrospective assessment, morphine use was 49 +/- 30 mg in the block group vs 79 +/- 25 mg in the no block group (P = 0.0063). For the prospective trial, patients who received nerve blocks with bupivacaine had a similar result, self-administering 48 +/- 27 mg of morphine over 24 hr compared to 67 +/- 28 mg administered by patients who received infiltrations of saline. However, despite the significant decrease in morphine use, there was no reduction in opioid-related adverse effects: the incidences of nausea were 41% and 46% (P = 0.70) and for itching were 79% and 63% (P = 0.25) in the placebo and nerve block groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: A multi-level ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve block technique can reduce the amount of systemic morphine required to control post-Cesarean delivery pain but this reduction was not associated with a reduction of opioid related adverse effects in our study group.",English,1

DESIGN: Randomized double-masked controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-eight patients with primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment undergoing scleral buckling surgery under GA. METHODS: Random allocation to either preoperative sub-Tenon's capsule injection of 3 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine or sub-Tenon's capsule injection of 3 ml of saline (controls) immediately before a scleral buckling procedure under GA. Intraoperative monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, need of analgesia with sevoflurane and alfentanil, time in the recovery unit, measurements of pain and nausea on the visual analog scale (VAS) up to 12 hours postoperatively, and consumption of analgesics and antiemetics was recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraoperative systolic blood pressure (BP); bradycardia; minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane; maximum postoperative VAS scores of pain and nausea; time in recovery unit; and total need of alfentanil, ketobemidone, dextropropoxyphene, and dixyrazine. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were analyzed (48 in the ropivacaine group and 49 controls). A significantly lower intraoperative systolic BP (104+/-6 vs. 112+/-7 mmHg; P = 0.004), less need of sevoflurane (1.33+/-0.19 vs. 1.56+/-0.23; P = 0.03), and shorter time in the recovery unit (67+/-9 vs. 76+/-16 minutes; P = 0.01) were observed in the ropivacaine group. Maximum VAS pain scores were 50+/-21 in the control group and 36+/-25 in the ropivacaine group (P = 0.05), with a significantly lower consumption of opioids (ketobemidone) in the ropivacaine group (3.6+/-3.5 vs. 1.3+/-2.0 mg). No significant difference was observed regarding nausea or need of dixyrazine or dextropropoxyphene postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative sub-Tenon's capsule injection of ropivacaine in scleral buckling surgery under GA lowers the intraoperative systolic BP, reduces the amount of inhalable sevoflurane needed, and enhances postoperative vigilance through reduction of pain and need of opioids.",eng,1

In this study we compare continuous paravertebral extrapleural to epidural infusion for post-thoracotomy pain control. METHODS: In a prospective fashion, 50 patients were randomized to receive either paravertebral or epidural infusion for post-thoracotomy pain control. The anesthesia department placed epidurals, and the operative surgeon placed unilateral paravertebral catheters. Patients were evaluated for analgesic efficacy and postoperative complications. RESULTS: We found that both methods of analgesia provide adequate postoperative pain control. Epidural infusion demonstrated an improved efficacy early in the postoperative course but provided statistically similar analgesia to paravertebral by postoperative day 2. Neither group demonstrated a greater number of pain-related complications. Narcotic-induced complications such as pruritus, nausea/vomiting, and postural hypotension/mental status changes/respiratory depression were seen with statistically similar frequency in both epidural and paravertebral arms. Urinary retention, however, was noted to be significantly more frequent in patients with epidural catheters. Drug toxicity was not observed with either epidural or paravertebral infusion. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend continuous paravertebral infusion as an improved method of post-thoracotomy analgesia that can be placed and managed by the surgeon.",eng,1

We report our institutional experience with PVB over the initial 8 months of use. All patients undergoing breast operations at the ambulatory care building from September 09, 2005 to June 28, 2005 were reviewed. Comparison was performed between patients receiving PVB and those who did not. Pain scores were assessed immediately, 4 hours, 8 hours and the morning after surgery. 178 patients received PVB and 135 patients did not. Patients were subdivided into three groups: Group A-segmental mastectomy only (n = 89), Group Bsegmental mastectomy and sentinel node surgery (n = 111) and Group C-more extensive breast surgery (n = 113). Immediately after surgery there was a statistically significant difference in the number of patients reporting pain between PVB patients and those without PVB. At all time points up until the morning after surgery PVB patients were significantly less likely to report pain than controls. Patients in Group C who received PVB were significantly less likely to require overnight stay. The average immediate pain scores were significantly lower in PVB patients than controls in both Group B and Group C and approached significance in Group A. PVB in breast surgical patients provided improved postoperative pain control. Pain relief was improved immediately postoperatively and this effect continued to the next day after surgery. PVB significantly decreased the proportion of patients that required overnight hospitalization after major breast operations and therefore may decrease cost associated with breast surgery. 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",English,0
Journal Article,D. J. Buggy; M. J. Kerin,2004.0,Paravertebral analgesia with levobupivacaine increases postoperative flap tissue oxygen tension after immediate latissimus dorsi breast reconstruction compared with intravenous opioid analgesia,", ","BACKGROUND: Directly measured tissue oxygen tension (Pto2) reflects the adequacy of local tissue oxygenation and influences surgical wound healing. Epidural analgesia increases Pto2 compared with intravenous morphine analgesia after abdominal surgery. The authors tested the hypothesis that paravertebral regional anesthesia and analgesia would increase Pto2 compared with intravenous opioid-based anesthesia and analgesia. METHODS: Twenty patients scheduled to undergo mastectomy with immediate latissimus dorsi breast reconstruction were randomized to receive either general anesthesia with postoperative intravenous morphine analgesia or combined general-paravertebral anesthesia with continuous paravertebral postoperative analgesia using levobupivacaine in this prospective, cohort study. All patients had a local tissue oxygen sensor implanted in the flap muscle. Data were downloaded continuously for 20 h postoperatively. RESULTS: The mean Pto2 over the 20-h period was significantly higher in patients receiving paravertebral anesthesia (75 +/- 38 vs. 44 +/- 23 mmHg [mean +/- SD]; P = 0.03). Intraoperative blood loss was less in paravertebral patients (1.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.5 l; P = 0.04). Dynamic visual analog scale pain scores were significantly lower in paravertebral patients. Intraoperative and postoperative fluids administered, hemoglobin, core temperature, intraoperative end-tidal carbon dioxide, and mean arterial pressure were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: The postoperative latissimus dorsi flap Pto2 was higher for 20 h after breast reconstruction with paravertebral analgesia compared with intravenous morphine analgesia.",eng,1

Aims: This article aimed to evaluate the evidence for varied techniques described for peri-operative pain management in breast surgery, and to review the literature on chronic pain after breast surgery and particularly 'post-mastectomy pain syndrome'. Method: A Pubmed search was performed, with the key words mastectomy"" and ""pain"" for articles in the English language in the adult human population (age > 19 years), looking specifically for different analgesic techniques that have been evaluated. Results: Thirty-three peer-reviewed publications with pain outcome data were included, ranging from 15 to 289 patients per study (total n = 2104). Twenty three were randomised controlled trials and the rest were prospective or retrospective audits and case series. Inconsistent trial methodology precluded a meta-analysis. Paravertebral local anaesthetic nerve blockade resulted in lower pain scores and fewer side effects than opioid-based regimens. Three risk factors emerged predicting chronic pain post-mastectomy: higher post-operative pain scores, age <65 years and inclusion of major reconstructive surgery. Conclusion: Paravertebral block should be considered for use in major breast surgery. Pain control should be optimised/a priority for both acute care and to potentially reduce chronic pain. 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.""",English,1

Design: Randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Inner city academic medical center, Day Surgery department. Patients: Inner city population presenting with menorrhagia. Intervention: Hysteroscopy, Dilation and Currettage, Thermal Balloon Ablation. Measurements and Main Results: Main endpoint: postop pain score by visual analogue scale starting on arrival to recovery room. VAS points were recorded Methods: Patients randomized to either placebo (saline) or anesthetic lower uterine block one week prior to procedure by independent consenting research assistant. All patients underwent intervention under general anesthesia with bag-mask ventilation. All received 30 mg intravenous ketorolac at procedure start. Postop pain was recorded by phone call to each patient (hourly) for 8 hours by 0-10 VAS score. All calls were made by an independent nurse. Patients recorded an ''overall'' pain VAS score at 24 hours postop. Assuming 80% power, type I error set at 5% (utilizing a significance level of .05), we calculated the N needed per group. Using data from seven patients treated by local block before study initiation, we calculated a delta to see a difference between severe pain (7) vs mild (3), and set Delta (D) at 40 mm per VAS. Using the standard deviation (SD) from these initial patients' mean VAS (42 mm), and a K value of 8 (80% power), 18 patients were needed in each arm for power. Results: 40 patients were randomized (20 treatment (mepivacine), 20 control (saline) (Table presented) Differences between groups were calculated using rank-sum test for continuous variables and Chi-square for binary data.

METHODS: This was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study designed to assess the effectiveness of a multimodal analgesic approach (MMA) vs patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) alone in patients undergoing open prostatectomy. Prior to surgery, paravertebral blocks (PVBs) were performed with either 0.5% ropivacaine in the MMA group or saline in the PCA group. Patients in the MMA group also received celecoxib (400 mg po prior to surgery and 200 mg po bid for seven days following surgery) and ketamine 10 mg iv. Following surgery, every patient had free access to morphine PCA. A pain numerical rating scale (NRS) at 24 hr was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included morphine consumption at 24 hr and SF-36 (36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) scores from two weeks to 24 weeks following surgery. RESULTS: The primary endpoint, average pain NRS at 24 hr, was 2.6 in the MMA group compared with 3.9 in the PCA group (difference = -1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.3 to -0.4; P = 0.01). The average morphine consumption at 24 hr was 4.8 mg in the MMA group compared with 10.5 mg in the PCA group (difference = -5.7, 95% CI: -13.0 to 0.5; P = 0.01). Higher SF-36 scores at two, four, eight, and 12 weeks were observed in the MMA group compared with the PCA group, but no statistically significant (P < 0.05) between-group difference was found after Bonferroni correction of comparisons conducted repeatedly over time. Postoperative adverse effects included low episodes of postoperative nausea and vomiting, bladder spasms, constipation, and pruritus. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that PVBs combined with celecoxib and ketamine provide better immediate postoperative pain control and facilitate earlier functional recovery in patients undergoing an open radical prostatectomy when compared with PCA alone.",eng,0

METHODS: In this prospective, double-blind, single-site, randomized, and parallel-arm controlled trial, 60 children were assigned to undergo bilateral SMB with general anesthesia with either 0.15 ml/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine (Ropi group) or 0.15 ml/kg of isotonic saline (Saline group) on each side. The primary endpoint was total postoperative morphine consumption at 48 h. Pain scores and respiratory- and SMB-related complications were noted. RESULTS: The overall dose of intravenous morphine after 48 h (mean [95% CI]) was lower in the Ropi group compared with that in the Saline group (104.3 [68.9 to 139.6] vs. 205.2 [130.7 to 279.7] mug/kg; P = 0.033). Continuous morphine infusion was less frequent in the Ropi group compared with that in the Saline group (1 patient [3.6%] vs. 9 patients [31%]; P = 0.006). Three patients in the Saline group had an episode of oxygen desaturation requiring oxygen therapy. There were no technical failures or immediate complications of the SMB. Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, doses of sufentanil, pain scores, and postoperative hydroxyzine requirements were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Bilateral SMB is an easy regional anesthesia technique that reduces total morphine consumption at 48 h after cleft palate repair in children and the use of continuous infusion of morphine and may decrease postoperative respiratory complications.",eng,1

The anatomy of CPCB was also tested in cadavers. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients (range, 67-96 years old) were prospectively randomized either to group A (given local anesthetics using a CPCB) or group B (given perioperative analgesia with meperidine). In another part of the study, CPCB was performed in 15 fresh cadavers, and dissection of the lumbar region was performed after dye injection. RESULTS: Continuous psoas compartment block was performed successfully in all patients in group A and was used in the pre- (16-48 hours) and postoperative (72 hours) periods. Visual analog scale score in group A was lower than in group B in 5/7 preoperative and 9/9 postoperative 8 hourly assessments. Differences reached statistical significance (P < .05) in 3 and 5 of the assessments, respectively. Patient satisfaction was higher in group A in the pre- (P < .05) and postoperative periods (P<.03). The block failed to achieve surgical anesthesia in 85% (17/20) of the patients, and additional anesthesia was needed. The anatomic study failed to support the existence of a defined psoas compartment"" previously described, and supported the clinical findings. Injected dye was found in the region of the origin of the sciatic nerve (essential for the production of anesthesia for hip surgery) in only 26% (4/15) of cadavers. CONCLUSIONS: The CPCB seems to be an appropriate technique for efficient and safe perioperative pain control. However, in our dissections, the psoas compartment was not well defined in all patients, thus, using this route for anesthesia may result in only partial success.""",eng,0

METHODS: Sixty consecutive ASA I or II children were randomly assigned to the following groups: in group B (block), intraoperative and postoperative analgesia was provided by peripheral nerve block; and in group O (opioids), intraoperative and postoperative analgesia was provided by intravenous opioids. The patients' age, sex and type of surgery were recorded as were the postoperative pain management and postoperative vomiting. Time to discharge from the recovery room, the postoperative ward and the time to discharge home were also noted. RESULTS: The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex, ASA physical status, weight, height and types of injuries. The incidence of postoperative pain (CHEOPS score >or=7) and the incidence of postoperative vomiting were significantly higher in group O than in group B: 26.6 versus 3.3%; P = 0.025, and 33.3 versus 6.6%; P = 0.011, respectively. The time before oral intake was significantly longer in group O than in group B [187 (75-265) min versus 60 (32-125) min, respectively, P = 0.0002]. The time to meet discharge home criteria was 277 (230-330) min in group O versus 210 (145-260) min in group B (P = 0.0039).

Sciatic nerve block combined with psoas compartment block is used as a technique alternative to central neuraxial block and GA. In geriatric patients that will undergo partial hip prosthesis, the effects of the methods of unilateral spinal anesthesia (SA) and L1 paravertebral block combined with psoas compartment block (PCB) and sciatic nerve block (PCSL) on peroperative hemodynamic parameters and the duration of need for postoperative analgesia were studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients from the ASA III-IV group were randomly divided into two groups. Group SA was administered spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine (2 ml, 0.5%) from the selected intervertebral distance (L4-L5 or L3-L4) in lateral position. Group PCSL was administered L1 paravertebral block combined with PCB and sciatic nerve block with bupivacaine hydrochloride (total 35 ml). Hemodynamic parameters (HR: heart rate and MAP: mean artery pressure) were recorded in pre- and post-intervention 5-minute intervals. The initial time of the need for analgesia of patients were evaluated postoperatively. RESULTS: Any failure in methods implemented on patients in either group was not observed. Times of anesthesia and surgical preparation of patients were observed to have significantly prolonged in the PCSL compared to Group SA (p < 0.005). Hundred and 5th and 110th min. mean arterial pressures of patients was found to be significantly higher in Group SA compared to Group PCSL (p < 0.05). The initial time of the need for analgesia was observed to be significantly prolonged in Group PCSL (432.80 +/- 236.77 min) compared to Group SA (185.40 +/- 171.40 min) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral SA conducted with bupivacaine hydrochloride and PCSL block technique provided a hemodynamically similar activity in the perioperative period in patients that underwent partial hip operation. However, PCSL block implementation extended the initial time of the need for analgesia in postoperative period. PCSL method could be selected in cases belonging to such group of patients.

Positioning patients for spinal anesthesia (SA) can be extremely painful. Peripheral nerve blockades are gaining popularity in this setting. This prospective, randomized study compares the efficacy of fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) to intravenous (IV) fentanyl for positioning hip fracture patients for SA. METHODS: Forty-one patients scheduled for hip fracture surgery were randomized to receive a bolus dose of IV fentanyl (IVFE) 1.5 mug/kg (IVFE group) or an FICB using 40 mL ropivacaine 0.5% (FICB group) 5 or 20 minutes before positioning for SA, respectively. Numeric rating pain scale scores before and following the analgesic intervention, time needed and quality of patient position for SA performance, postoperative analgesia in terms of time to first IV morphine dose demand and morphine consumption during the first 24 hours, and patient satisfaction were documented. RESULTS: Compared with the IVFE group, the FICB group showed significantly lower numeric rating pain scale scores in all instances following the analgesic intervention (P < 0.001), shorter spinal performance time (P = 0.001), and better quality of position (P = 0.001). Postoperative morphine consumption was lower (P = 0.026), the time to first dose demand was longer (P = 0.001), and patient satisfaction rates were higher (P < 0.001) in the FICB group.

This prospective, randomized study tested the hypothesis that the TAP block would provide comparable analgesia after pediatric inguinal surgery compared with a conventional ultrasound-guided ilioinguinal block. METHODS: After induction of general anesthesia, infants and children presenting for elective inguinal surgery were randomly assigned to receive an ultrasound-guided TAP block (needle cephalad of the iliac crest at the anterior axillary line) (n = 20) or ilioinguinal block (needle immediately anteromedial to the anterior superior iliac spine) (n = 21). Supplemental analgesia consisted of as-required intraoperative fentanyl, regular acetaminophen, as-required ibuprofen, and rescue morphine. Patients were assessed in the recovery room, the day-stay unit (30 min to 2 h after surgery) and at 24 h for age appropriate numerical pain score, analgesic consumption, and parental satisfaction. RESULTS: In the day-stay unit, pain was more frequent (76% vs 45%, P = 0.040), and ibuprofen use was higher (62% vs 30%, P = 0.037) in the TAP group. Recovery room pain, morphine consumption and postdischarge ibuprofen use, comfort and satisfaction scores were similar between groups.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of a 5-mg/kg lidocaine bolus injected in the thoracic paravertebral space during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in noncardiac patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Design: Prospective, observational study. Setting: Tertiary care university hospital. Participant: Twenty patients undergoing thoracotomy for lung resection. Interventions: In addition to standard monitoring, cardiac output, preload parameters (global diastolic volume, total intrathoracic blood volume, and systolic volume variation), and myocardial contractility (dP<sub>max</sub> and cardiac function index) were measured with an aortic transpulmonary thermodilution technique. Measurements and Main Results: After OLV initiation, a paravertebral lidocaine bolus of 5 mg/kg (2%) caused decreases in the dP<sub>max</sub> and cardiac function index that lasted up to 30 minutes. Accompanying minor reductions in heart rate and systolic blood pressure required no vasoactive drugs and were self-limiting. None of the other hemodynamic parameters studied was significantly altered. Conclusions: In noncardiac patients, TPVB is associated with good hemodynamic stability, despite a small and transient decrease in myocardial contractility that could be related to the drug's systemic effects after its absorption. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, by 24 hours, those who had received popliteal blocks had significantly higher pain with no difference by 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Popliteal block provides equivalent postoperative pain control to general anesthesia alone in patients undergoing operative fixation of ankle fractures. However, patients who receive popliteal blocks do experience a significant increase in pain between 12 and 24 hours. Recognition of this rebound pain"" with early narcotic administration may allow patients to have more effective postoperative pain control.""",eng,0

All patients received the same premedications and the same postoperative analgesic regimen. The standardized postoperative analgesic, intramuscular pyroxicam 20 mg, was given to all patients in the recovery room and an additional 20 mg on the same day was given as requested by each patient. Pulmonary function studies and arterial blood gas analysis were performed 1 h prior to the operation and at the postoperative 8th and 24th hours. All patients underwent Lichtenstein's tension-free hernioplasty. Postoperative pain and fatigue were registered 8 h and 24 h after the operation. A questionnaire was filled out by the patients, and they were asked to give grades for the general comfort of the anesthesia and the surgical procedure (1 = worst, 10 = best). Postoperative pulmonary function tests were significantly poorer in the GA group both on 8th- and 24th-hour measurements (P < 0.05). Patients who underwent LA had significantly lower PCO<sub>2</sub> and higher PO<sub>2</sub> at the postoperative 8th hour (P < 0.05). Mean postoperative pain and fatigue scores revealed a significant difference in favor of local anesthesia at only the 8th hour (P < 0.05). There were two complications, one in each group (a hematoma in LA and a urinary retention in GA). Patient satisfaction grades were not different in the two groups. We conclude that LA in inguinal hernia repair does not adversely affect pulmonary functions, patients feel less pain, and patient satisfaction is comparable to that with GA.",English,0

Blockade of afferent neuronal barrage has been reported to reduce pain following some, but not all, types of surgery. This study evaluated whether blockade of sensory input with a long-acting local anesthetic reduces postoperative pain after the anesthetic effects have dissipated. Forty-eight patients underwent oral surgery with general anesthesia in a parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects randomly received either 0.5% bupivacaine or saline intraoral injections, general anesthesia was induced with propofol, a non-opioid anesthetic, and 2-4 third molars extracted. Subjects were assessed at 24 and 48 h for postoperative pain and analgesic intake. Blood samples were collected at baseline, intraoperatively and at 1-h intervals postoperatively for measurement of beta-endorphin as an index of CNS response to nociceptor input. Plasma beta-endorphin levels increased significantly from baseline to the end of surgery in the saline group in comparison to the bupivacaine group (P < 0.05), indicating effective blockade of nociceptor input into the CNS by the local anesthetic. Pain intensity was not significantly different between groups at 24 h. Pain at 48 h was decreased in the bupivacaine group as measured by category scale and graphic rating scales for pain and unpleasantness (P < 0.05). Additionally, subjects in the bupivacaine group self-administered fewer codeine tablets for unrelieved pain over 24-48 h postoperatively (P < 0.05). These data support previous animal studies demonstrating that blockade of peripheral nociceptive barrage during and immediately after tissue injury results in decreased pain at later time points. The results suggest that blockade of nociceptive input by administration of a long-acting local anesthetic decreases the development of central hyperexcitability, resulting in less pain and analgesic intake.",eng,0

Vaz,2011.0,Effect of optimal regional analgesia on arterial tone after total hip arthroplasty,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AAP.0b013e318228df0c,"Introduction: Pain causes activation of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to vasoconstriction, hypertension and tachycardia. For older patients with significant cardiac history, any increase in vascular tone and thus cardiac afterload could potentially cause serious complications. Thus, the goal of the optimal analgesic is to not only decrease pain, but also prevent potentially adverse hemodynamic consequences. Methods: This double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to study the effect of optimal regional analgesia on arterial tone after total hip replacement (THR) on patients ages 60-100. Patients undergoing THR were randomized to receive either combined spinal epidural alone (CSE) or CSE with lumbar plexus block (LPB). The Pulsecor monitor was used to measure the augmentation index (AI), which has been validated as a measure of arterial tone and can be obtained non-invasively from a regular blood pressure cuff. Arterial tone was recorded at the following times: 1) before surgery in the holding area, 2) in the operating room before the start of surgery, 3) in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) after recovery of the spinal block, 4) in the PACU, 2 hours after the initial assessment, 5)on post operative day(POD) 1, and 6) on POD2. Our study was powered to detect a 30% difference in AI between the two groups. Secondary outcomes were: 1) pain scores in the PACU and on POD1 and POD2 while patients were at rest, after pain was controlled, 2) Use of anti-emetic medication (or number of occurrences), 3) Incidence of nausea/vomiting, 4) temperature and leukocyte count as markers of immune activation, and 5) total opioid use (including epidural patient controlled analgesia and oral opioid consumption). Results: After obtaining written, informed consent, 92 patients were enrolled. 2 patients were excluded due to equipment failure shortly after enrollment. Of the remaining patients, 44 patients received CSE alone and 46 patients received CSE and LPB. Patient demographics were similar in both groups. Although the LPB group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of VAS scores in the PACU (P<0.05), overall, the addition of a LPB did not significantly reduce the AI when compared to the control group. Other outcomes were similar in both groups (P>0.05). No adverse events attributable to the LPB occurred. Comments: The addition of a LPB provided better pain control in the PACU, but did not reduce the AI, as measured by the Pulsecor, compared to the control group. We conclude that the addition of a LPB may have limited ability to affect arterial tone in the presence of a continuous infusion of epidural analgesics. Given the known sympatholytic effects of regional anesthesia, it is possible that beneficial effects on AI may be appreciated when comparing regional analgesic to intravenous or oral techniques. However, the use of CSE and LPB represent the standard of care at our institution and further evaluation is not possible at this point in time. (Figure presented).",English,0

A considerable proportion (25-40%) of patients experience severe pain, despite a comprehensive multimodal analgesic regimen. We hypothesized that adductor canal block (ACB) would reduce pain in this patient category compared with placebo. METHODS: Fifty patients with severe pain, defined as having a visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score of >60 during active flexion of the knee on the first or the second postoperative day after TKA, were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All the patients had received a comprehensive multimodal analgesic regimen. Group A received an ACB with ropivacaine 0.75%, 30 ml at time 0 and isotonic saline after 45 min. Group B received an ACB with isotonic saline at time 0 and ropivacaine 0.75%, 30 ml after 45 min. RESULTS: A 32-mm difference in VAS pain score, during active flexion of the knee (primary endpoint), was observed in favour of Group A, 95% confidence interval (CI): 23-42, P<0.0001. At rest, the difference in VAS pain score was 15 mm in favour of Group A, 95% CI: 8-23 mm, P=0.0001. Individual patient analysis revealed that 25% of the patients had no effect during active flexion. At rest, however, only 8% had more than mild pain after ACB compared with 57% at inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: ACB reduced VAS with 32 mm, during active flexion of the knee, in patients with severe pain after TKA, but a large proportion (78%) still had at least moderate, movement-related pain.

Methods: Following IRB approval, 75 consecutive patients presenting for thoracotomy were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial. Patients entered one of four groups: epidural bupivacaine + opioid (Epi B+O); epidural bupivacaine alone (Epi B); OnQ intercostal catheter with bupivacaine (OnQ); and epidural plus OnQ catheters both with bupivacaine (E+OnQ). Epidural catheters were placed preoperatively at approximately the T6 level. Patients who randomized to a non-epidural group received a sham epidural catheter: their skin was anesthetized and an epidural catheter secured externally to the skin with a sterile dressing. At the conclusion of surgery, all subjects had an extra-pleural intercostal nerve OnQ infusion catheter placed at the level of incision. In addition, prior to chest closure all subjects also received intercostal nerve blocks above and below the surgical incision with single injections of 0.25% bupivacaine. The OnQ and epidural catheter infusions were begun immediately upon entry to the PACU. Epidural analgesics (basal 2 ml/hr with 1 ml q10 min PCA) were 0.25% bupivacaine alone, or 0.25% bupivacaine with 0.01mg/ml hydromorphone; while OnQ intercostal infusions were 0.25% bupivacaine at 8 ml per hour. All patients could receive IV opioid PCA should the catheter system fail to provide adequate analgesia. Visual analog pain scores (VAS) were obtained in PACU, and each morning of post-operative day (POD) one -four. Incentive spirometry results and pain scores during spirometry were also obtained on each POD for the duration of therapy. VAS results were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test. Incentive spirometry values as a measure of postoperative pulmonary function were compared using the student's t-test. Results: There were no significant differences for sex, age, weight, or ASA classification between groups. Pain scores on arrival in PACU were similar between all groups. There was no difference in mean +/- SD pain scores over POD 1-3 between the OnQ (3.3+/-2.2) and Epi B (3.1+/-2.8) local anesthetic groups, however Epi B+O provided superior analgesia (2.6+/-1.9; p<.05) compared with local anesthetic alone groups. Five patients in the OnQ group required supplementation with IV PCA, while 3 patients in the Epi B+O group required IV PCA. Of the 3 subjects in the Epi B+O group requiring IV PCA, 2 of these resulted from catheter dislodgement (analgesia prior to catheter loss was adequate). Postoperative incentive spirometry of >2L was best in the Epi B+O group (87%), compared (p<.05) with OnQ (78%), E+OnQ (78%), or Epi B (61%). The combination of thoracic epidural bupivacaine with intercostal bupivacaine (E+OnQ) did not provide significantly greater analgesia (3.5+/-1.3; n=9) than either catheter alone. Conclusions: 1) Intercostal nerve block with continuous bupivacaine using the OnQ catheter system provided excellent postoperative analgesia for thoracotomy. 2) Thoracic epidural bupivacaine with hydromorphone provided superior analgesia and pulmonary function compared with intercostal continuous nerve block following thoracotomy. 3) Intercostal nerve analgesia with the OnQ system was equal to thoracic epidural analgesia when bupivacaine alone was utilized.",English,0

The efficacy of local anaesthetic infiltration into incision sites has only been shown in patients undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy. However, in one meta-analysis of the literature, intraperitoneal LA have been shown to be effective for pain relief following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The present review of the literature was done to summarise current knowledge on the effects of LA following LC. The Medline database was searched via PubMed to identify relevant randomised clinical trials in patients undergoing LC and where LA was used for pain management. The literature was restricted to adults (> 19 years) and humans. Abstracts of all articles were searched to determine if the trial was a comparison between LA and placebo injected intraperitoneally or infiltrated locally, with relevant postoperative data on pain scores, analgesic consumption and side effects. A total of 31 relevant studies were identified from which data could be extracted. Postoperative pain, in general, was mild to moderate after LC, worst at the incision site or intra-abdominally. Five of six studies in which LA were injected locally found beneficial effects on postoperative pain but not analgesic consumption for up to 24 hours postoperatively. When injected intraperitoneally, 14 of 23 studies found a reduction in pain scores in the LA group but only 9 of 21 found a reduction in analgesic consumption. A meta-analysis of only three studies with extractable data found no difference in abdominal pain during 0-24 hours between the LA and placebo groups. Side effects were few but some studies reported toxic plasma concentrations of LA in some patients, although no symptoms of LA toxicity were seen in these patients. In conclusion, LA have some beneficial effects when infiltrated locally and intraperitoneally. Although side effects are rare, the dose of LA should be monitored closely to avoid toxicity. Future studies should be directed towards determining whether the analgesic effects of LA are via peripheral mechanisms or systemic absorption. The explanation for the wide interindividual variation in pain following LC should also be better investigated.",eng,1

The safety and effectiveness of different pharmacological interventions such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and anticonvulsant analgesics in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is unknown., Objectives, To assess the benefits and harms of different analgesics in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy., Search methods, We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform portal (WHO ICTRP) to March 2013 to identify randomised clinical trials of relevance to this review., Selection criteria, We considered only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing different pharmacological interventions with no intervention or inactive controls for outcomes related to benefit in this review. We considered comparative non-randomised studies with regards to treatment-related harms. We also considered trials that compared one class of drug with another class of drug for this review., Data collection and analysis, Two review authors collected the data independently. We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis. For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)., Main results, We included 25 trials with 2505 participants randomised to the different pharmacological agents and inactive controls. All the trials were at unclear risk of bias. Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Participants were allowed to take additional analgesics as required in 24 of the trials. The pharmacological interventions in all the included trials were aimed at preventing pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There were considerable differences in the pharmacological agents used and the methods of administration. The estimated effects of the intervention on the proportion of participants who were discharged as day-surgery, the length of hospital stay, or the time taken to return to work were imprecise in all the comparisons in which these outcomes were reported (very low quality evidence). There was no mortality in any of the groups in the two trials that reported mortality (183 participants, very low quality evidence). Differences in serious morbidity outcomes between the groups were imprecise across all the comparisons (very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported patient quality of life or time taken to return to normal activity. The pain at 4 to 8 hours was generally reduced by about 1 to 2 cm on the visual analogue scale of 1 to 10 cm in the comparisons involving the different pharmacological agents and inactive controls (low or very low quality evidence). The pain at 9 to 24 hours was generally reduced by about 0.5 cm (a modest reduction) on the visual analogue scale of 1 to 10 cm in the comparisons involving the different pharmacological agents and inactive controls (low or very low quality evidence)., Authors' conclusions, There is evidence of very low quality that different pharmacological agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioid analgesics, and anticonvulsant analgesics reduce pain scores in people at low anaesthetic risk undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the decision to use these drugs has to weigh the clinically small reduction in pain against uncertain evidence of serious adverse events associated with many of these agents. Further randomised clinical trials of low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary. Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their as",English.,1

METHODS: Trials were identified by a systematic search of MEDLINE, review articles, and references of relevant trials from the period 1966-1999, including only English-language articles. Included trials involved a control group, any intervention, and reported phantom pain as an outcome. RESULTS: Twelve trials were identified, including 375 patients whose follow-ups ranged in duration from 1 week to 2 years. Only three randomized, controlled studies with parallel groups and three randomized crossover trials were identified. Eight trials examined treatment of acute phantom pain, including epidural treatments (three trials), regional nerve blocks (three trials), treatment with calcitonin (one trial), and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (one trial). Three trials demonstrated a positive impact of the intervention on phantom limb pain, but the remainder demonstrated no difference between the intervention and control groups. Four trials examined late postoperative interventions, including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (two trials) and the use of Farabloc (a metal threaded sock) and ketamine (one trial each). With regard to late postoperative interventions, three of the four trials showed modest short-term reduction of phantom limb pain. There was no relation between the quality of the trial and a positive result of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Although up to 70% of patients have phantom limb pain after amputation, there is little evidence from randomized trials to guide clinicians with treatment. Evidence on preemptive epidurals, early regional nerve blocks, and mechanical vibratory stimulation provides inconsistent support for these treatments. There is currently a gap between research and practice in the area of phantom limb pain.",eng,1

In Group A (n = 10) patients received bupivacaine intermittently into the wound and continuously into the coeliac plexus following an initial bolus. A total of 862.5 mg of bupivacaine was used over 12 h with no observed toxicity. Group B (n = 10) received equal volumes of saline. Although pain relief was poor in both groups, the bupivacaine group used less morphine postoperatively and had lower pain scores than the saline group 4 h after operation (P less than 0.05). Pulmonary function was significantly reduced in both groups with no statistical difference between the two. Significant reductions in serum glucose and cortisol were achieved (P less than 0.05), suggesting that afferent neural blockade was partially effective in attenuating the neuroendocrine response. However, the postoperative rise in interleukin-6 was not affected by this technique. It is concluded that total afferent neural blockade cannot be achieved with peripheral wound and coeliac plexus administration of relatively large doses of local anaesthetic during upper abdominal surgery.",eng,0

Bilateral superficial cervical plexus block by administration of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:200000 epinephrine at the end of surgery has been shown to improve postoperative analgesia. The objective of this study was to assess the analgesic efficacy in the first 36 postoperative hours after total thyroidectomy of bilateral superficial cervical plexus block with 0.75% ropivacaine administered before the incision or on completion of the surgical procedure. METHODS: We performed a prospective double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that compared 3 parallel groups: the CONT group did not receive any block, the PRE group received bilateral superficial cervical plexus block before surgery while under general anesthesia, and the POST group received bilateral superficial cervical plexus block after surgery while under general anesthesia. The study included 111 patients (37 in each group). Postoperative pain was assessed every 4 hours by use of a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale. All patients received paracetamol every 6 hours. Morphine was administered following a standardized protocol if the numeric rating scale was 4 or higher. The main outcome variables were the proportion of patients given morphine during the 36 hours period, pain intensity scores, and morphine consumption. RESULTS: No intergroup differences were observed in terms of percentage of patients who required morphine, morphine delivery, pain scores, and intraoperative opioid consumption.

Ilfeld,2011.0,Continuous peripheral nerve blocks: a review of the published evidence,10.1213/ANE.0b013e3182285e01,"A continuous peripheral nerve block, also termed perineural local anesthetic infusion,"" involves the percutaneous insertion of a catheter adjacent to a peripheral nerve, followed by local anesthetic administration via the catheter, providing anesthesia/analgesia for multiple days or even months. Continuous peripheral nerve blocks may be provided in the hospital setting, but the use of lightweight, portable pumps permits ambulatory infusion as well. This technique's most common application is providing analgesia after surgical procedures. However, additional indications include treating intractable hiccups; inducing a sympathectomy and vasodilation to increase blood flow after a vascular accident, digit transfer/replantation, or limb salvage; alleviating vasospasm of Raynaud disease; and treating peripheral embolism and chronic pain such as complex regional pain syndrome, phantom limb pain, trigeminal neuralgia, and cancer-induced pain. After trauma, perineural infusion can provide analgesia during transportation to a distant treatment center, or while simply awaiting surgical repair. Catheter insertion may be accomplished using many possible modalities, including nerve stimulation, ultrasound guidance, paresthesia induction, fluoroscopic imaging, and simple tactile perceptions (""facial click""). Either a nonstimulating epidural-type catheter may be used, or a ""stimulating catheter"" that delivers electrical current to its tip. Administered infusate generally includes exclusively long-acting, dilute, local anesthetic delivered as a bolus only, basal only, or basal-bolus combination. Documented benefits appear to be dependent on successfully improving analgesia, and include decreasing baseline/breakthrough/dynamic pain, supplemental analgesic requirements, opioid-related side effects, and sleep disturbances. In some cases, patient satisfaction and ambulation/functioning may be improved; an accelerated resumption of passive joint range-of-motion realized; and the time until discharge readiness as well as actual discharge from the hospital or rehabilitation center achieved. Lastly, postoperative joint inflammation and inflammatory markers may be decreased. Nearly all benefits occur during the infusion itself, but several randomized controlled trials suggest that in some situations there are prolonged benefits after catheter removal as well. Easily rectified minor complications occur somewhat frequently, but major risks including clinically relevant infection and nerve injury are relatively rare. This article is an evidence-based review of the published literature involving continuous peripheral nerve blocks.""",eng,1

Ball,2011.0,"Continuous femoral versus posterior lumbar plexus nerve blocks for analgesia after hip arthroplasty: a randomized, controlled study",10.1213/ANE.0b013e318212495b,"BACKGROUND: Hip arthroplasty frequently requires potent postoperative analgesia, often provided with an epidural or posterior lumbar plexus local anesthetic infusion. However, American Society of Regional Anesthesia guidelines now recommend against epidural and continuous posterior lumbar plexus blocks during administration of various perioperative anticoagulants often administered after hip arthroplasty. A continuous femoral nerve block is a possible analgesic alternative, but whether it provides comparable analgesia to a continuous posterior lumbar plexus block after hip arthroplasty remains unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that differing the catheter insertion site (femoral versus posterior lumbar plexus) after hip arthroplasty has no impact on postoperative analgesia. METHODS: Preoperatively, subjects undergoing hip arthroplasty were randomly assigned to receive either a femoral or a posterior lumbar plexus stimulating catheter inserted 5 to 15 cm or 0 to 1 cm past the needle tip, respectively. Postoperatively, patients received perineural ropivacaine, 0.2% (basal 6 mL/hr, bolus 4 mL, 30-minute lockout) for at least 2 days. The primary end point was the average daily pain scores as measured with a numeric rating scale (0-10) recorded in the 24-hour period beginning at 07:30 the morning after surgery, excluding twice-daily physical therapy sessions. Secondary end points included pain during physical therapy, ambulatory distance, and supplemental analgesic requirements during the same 24-hour period, as well as satisfaction with analgesia during hospitalization. RESULTS: The mean (SD) pain scores for subjects receiving a femoral infusion (n = 25) were 3.6 (1.8) versus 3.5 (1.8) for patients receiving a posterior lumbar plexus infusion (n = 22), resulting in a group difference of 0.1 (95% confidence interval -0.9 to 1.2; P = 0.78). Because the confidence interval was within a prespecified -1.6 to 1.6 range, we conclude that the effect of the 2 analgesic techniques on postoperative pain was equivalent. Similarly, we detected no differences between the 2 treatments with respect to the secondary end points, with one exception: subjects with a femoral catheter ambulated a median (10th-90th percentiles) 2 (0-17) m the morning after surgery, in comparison with 11 (0-31) m for subjects with a posterior lumbar plexus catheter (data nonparametric; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: After hip arthroplasty, a continuous femoral nerve block is an acceptable analgesic alternative to a continuous posterior lumbar plexus block when using a stimulating perineural catheter. However, early ambulatory ability suffers with a femoral infusion.",eng,1

We hypothesised that the adductor-canal-blockade would reduce pain during flexion of the knee (primary end point) and at rest, as well as reducing morphine consumption and morphine-related side effects (secondary outcomes) compared with placebo. METHODS: We enrolled patients scheduled for elective TKA into this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study. During general anaesthesia, we placed a catheter in the adductor canal, and after obtaining pre-block pain scores 30 min post-operatively, we injected 30 ml of ropivacaine 0.75% (n = 21) or saline (n = 20) according to randomisation. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01261897. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were randomised, and 41 were analysed. Mean (standard deviation) pain scores during flexion of the knee at 1 h post-operatively were 58 (22) mm and 67 (29) mm, ropivacaine and placebo group, respectively (P = 0.23) but was significantly reduced in the ropivacaine group when calculated as area under the curve for the interval 1-6 h (P = 0.02). There were no statistically significant differences regarding pain at rest (P = 0.08), morphine consumption (P = 0.06), nor morphine-related side effects, apart from nausea (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study shows promising results regarding the analgesic efficacy of adductor-canal-blockade in post-operative pain treatment after TKA, with a significant reduction in pain during flexion of the knee in the early post-operative period compared with placebo.

Other secondary endpoints were adductor strength and ability to ambulate. Methods: The authors enrolled healthy young men into this double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study. On two separate study days, subjects received either ACB or FNB with ropivacaine, and placebo in the opposite limb. Strength was assessed as maximum voluntary isometric contraction for quadriceps and adductor muscles. In addition, subjects performed three standardized ambulation tests. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01449097. Results: Twelve subjects were randomized, 11 analyzed. Quadriceps strength (area under the curve, 0.5-6 h) was significantly reduced when comparing ACB with placebo (5.0 + 1.0 vs. 5.9 + 0.6, P = 0.02, CI:-1.5 to-0.2), FNB with placebo (P = 0.0004), and when comparing FNB with ACB (P = 0.002). The mean reduction from baseline was 8% with ACB and 49% with FNB. The only statistically significant difference in adductor strength was between placebo and FNB (P = 0.007). Performance in all mobilization tests was reduced after an FNB compared with an ACB (P < 0.05). Conclusions: As compared with placebo ACB statistically significantly reduced quadriceps strength, but the reduction was only 8% from baseline. ACB preserved quadriceps strength and ability to ambulate better than FNB did. Future studies are needed to compare the analgesic effect of the ACB with the FNB in a clinical setting. 2013, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.

In contrast, the adductor canal block (ACB) is predominately a sensory nerve block. In this study we hypothesized that the ACB preserves quadriceps muscle strength compared with FNB (primary endpoint), in patients following TK A. Secondary endpoints were effect on morphine consumption, pain, adductor strength, morphine-related side effects, and mobilization ability. Methods: We performed a double blind, randomized controlled study, including patients scheduled for TK A in spinal anesthesia. The trial was approved by the local Regional Ethics Committee (H-3-2011-090) and registered at www. clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01470391). According to randomization the patients received either a continuous ACB or a continuous FNB via a catheter with a bolus of 30 ml 0.5% ropivacaine given initially, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine, 8ml/h. Additional analgesics consisted of paracetamol, ibuprofen, and patient controlled analgesia with intravenous morphine. Muscle strength was assessed with a hand-held dynamometer preoperatively and 24 h postoperatively. Pain, morphine consumption and morphine related side effects were assessed at 2, 4, 8 and 24 h postoperatively. Mobilization ability was assessed at 24 h postoperatively. Results: Fifty-three patients were randomized and 48 patients analyzed. Quadriceps strength was significantly lower in the FNB group compared with the ACB group (median [range] percent of baseline, 18% [4-48] versus 52% [31-71], respectively, P=0.004). There was no difference between the groups regarding morphine consumption (mean + SD, 22 mg + 21 vs. 22 mg + 9, respectively, P=0.94), pain at rest (AUC 2-24 h, P=0.21), pain during flexion of the knee (AUC 2-24 h, P=0.16), or adductor muscle strength (mean +SD, 74% + 29 vs. 85 % +54, respectively, P=0.39). There was no difference between the groups regarding morphine-related side effects or mobilization ability (P>0.05). Conclusion: TKA in itself has influence on quadriceps muscle performance and causes functional limitations. In this study, the ACB preserved quadriceps muscle strength better than the FNB, without any difference in pain relief. The ACB may therefore be considered an alternative to the FNB for postoperative pain treatment following TK A.",English,0

The aim of this study is to develop evidence-based, consensus recommendations for the effective management of pain after hernia repair, developed from a procedurespecific systematic review, transferable evidence from relevant procedures, and clinical practice observations. Methods : Systematic literature review using the Cochrane protocol was performed. Randomized studies in English, assessing analgesic or anesthetic interventions in hernia repair surgery in adults, and reporting pain on a linear analogue, verbal or numerical rating scale published between 1966 and March 2009 were included. Primary outcome measures were postoperative pain scores and secondary outcome measures were supplemental analgesic requirements and other recovery outcomes (e.g., adverse effects, functional recovery). Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed where appropriate. Challenging Case Report (only complete if your submission falls into the Challenging Case Report"" category. If you select the ""Challenging Case Report"" category on the next step, this section must be completed.): N/A Results : Of the 335 randomised studies identified, 81 studies were included. The reasons for exclusion included pain scores not reported, alternative non-pharmacologic interventions evaluated, surgical interventions assessed, and laparoscopic approach used. Discussion : Although SA provides excellent surgical anaesthesia and early postoperative analgesia, potential limitations (e.g., delayed ambulation and increased incidence of urinary retention) could impact discharge after ambulatory surgery. Field block (ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric/genitofemoral nerve blocks) with or without wound infiltration, either as a sole anaesthetic/ analgesic technique or as adjunct to GA, is recommended to reduce postoperative pain. Continuous local anaesthetic infusion of surgical wound provides longer duration of analgesia. Conventional NSAIDs or COX-2-selective inhibitors in combination with paracetamol, administered in time to provide sufficient analgesia in the early recovery period, are recommended. In addition, weak opioids are recommended for moderate pain, and strong opioids for severe pain on request. There is a need to evaluate optimal multimodal analgesia strategies. The role of TAP block in comparison with traditional field block needs to be evaluated. Intra-wound capsaicin has been shown to provide excellent analgesia, and requires further evaluation. Furthermore, the role of ketamine and alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin/pregabalin), particularly in patients at high risk of persistent postoperative pain, need evaluation.""",English,0

The provision of excellent pain relief with minimal side effects is important in order to facilitate patient mobilisation and rehabilitation.Spinal opioids provide excellent analgesia but are associated with adverse effects. The fascia-iliaca block is an alternative technique which provides analgesia to the nerves innervating the hip. The success of fascia iliaca blocks has been demonstrated to be superior when using ultrasound compared to landmark techniques. However, the clinical benefit of this improvement has yet to be investigated.The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ultrasound guided fascia iliaca block with spinal morphine for hip replacement surgery. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial. Patients scheduled to undergo unilateral primary hip arthroplasty will receive a study information sheet and consent will be obtained in keeping with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients will be randomised to receive either; (i) Ultrasound guided fascia iliaca block using levobupivacaine, plus spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine containing no morphine, or (ii) sham ultrasound guided fascia iliaca block performed with sterile saline, and spinal anaesthesia containing hyperbaric bupivacaine and 0.1 mg of spinal morphine.A total of 108 patients will be recruited. Primary outcome is post-operative morphine consumption in a 24 hour period. Secondary outcomes include; pain scores at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours, episodes of respiratory depression, hypotension, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, sedation, time to first mobilisation and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: There are no studies to date comparing ultrasound guided fascia iliaca block with spinal morphine for pain control after hip arthroplasty. If the ultrasound guided fascia iliaca block provides pain relief which is not inferior to spinal morphine, then morphine could be removed from the spinal injection. This could reduce side effects and improve patient safety.

The following study examines the impact of continuous psoas compartment block on surgical stress response and postoperative pain comparing to intravenous opioids in patients who underwent hip replacement surgery. Materials and Methods: After approval of the local ethics committee, two groups of patients were included in this prospective randomised study. The Psoas Compartment Group (PC) of 32 patients aged of 59,2+6,8 (ASA IIIII) and the Morphine group (M) of 30 patients aged 61,5+7,2 (ASA II-III). In all patients, general anasthesia was induced with 2.5 mg/kg propofol, 5 mg/ kg fentanil and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. Following intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with 1.5-2% sevoflurane in a N2O/O2 (2:1) mix ture. Preoperatively, in the PC group catheter was inserted into psoas compartment using Contiplex Tuohy set (BBraun, Meslungen Germany) and 20 ml bolus of Levobupivacane 0.25% was given. Postoperatively, analgesia was maintained by continuous infusion of Levobupivacane 0.25% 7+1.8ml/h.

The aim of this study was to compare postoperative pain levels following intermittent regional administration of bupivacaine via a catheter placed in the rectus sheath or subcutaneously at abdominal surgery through midline incisions. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing elective midline laparotomy were assigned randomly to a group with two catheters placed over the fascia (suprafascial group) before surgical wound closure or to a group with catheters placed between the two sheaths of each rectus muscle (interfascial group). Pain levels were determined every 12 h, both at rest and with movement, by means of a standard visual analogue scale (VAS) for 72 h after surgery. The amounts of administered opioid were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled in the study (30 patients in each group).The median VAS score 36 h after surgery, both at rest and with movement, was significantly lower in the interfascial group than in the suprafascial group (P<0.050). Repeated-measures ANOVA also showed a significant difference in the postoperative VAS scores (P<0.007). The amount of self-administered morphine was significantly lower in the interfascial group, overall (P = 0.001) as well as on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.001) and day 2 (P = 0.016). Bowel sounds returned more quickly in the interfascial group (P = 0.040). CONCLUSION: Locoregional catheter administration of bupivacaine following midline laparotomy is more effective when the catheter is placed in the rectus sheath compared with suprafascial delivery.

Several studies have noted that femoral nerve blocks (FNB) provide superior pain control and shortened hospital stay, in comparison with epidural or intravenous PCA alone (ref 1-2). However, in recent years, studies have reported a small (2% incidence), but significant risk of falls after prolonged motor blockade from FNB's (ref 3). An anatomical study of the adductor canal (AC) has demonstrated that the resulting sensory changes are not limited to the distribution of the saphenos nerve (ref 4). They noted that medial, anterior, and lateral aspects of the knee showed sensory loss extending from the superior pole of the patella to the proximal tibia, without any noticeable motor effect in the quadriceps muscles. The AC may serve as a conduit for more than just the saphenous nerve, possibly including the medial femoral cutaneous nerve, articular branches from the obturator nerve, as well as the medial retinacular nerve. Using anatomical landmarks and an ultrasound device, the nerve can be easily identified and blocked within the AC (ref 5-7). The question our study attempts to answer is: does the saphenous nerve block provide equivalent analgesia to the femoral nerve block, while avoiding significant motor blockade?"" Methods: This was a prospective, double-blinded (patient and data collector), randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating either a FNB or SNB's effect on quadriceps strength and analgesia after total knee arthroplasty. A dynamometer was used to assess quadriceps strength. Patients were instructed to raise their legs three times. After each leg raise, a NRS pain score was recorded. Both operative and nonoperative legs were assessed preoperatively, and 6-8 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours post-anesthesia administration. A pinprick sensory exam was also performed to confirm successful blockade. Results: 38 patients received FNB, 41 patients received SNB. No significant difference was found in demographics (Table 1). While there was no significant difference in dynamometer readings prior to surgery, patients with a FNB had significantly lower dynamometer readings in the recovery room (6-8 hours) versus the SNB treatment group. For postoperative days (POD) 1 and 2, there was no statistical difference in dynamometer results between the two groups. Analysis of NRS pain scores revealed no difference preoperatively, nor 6-8 hours postoperatively. While the NRS pain scores equalized on POD 2, the difference in pain scores were higher in patients with the SNB on POD 1 (P = 0.0034). Comments: This comparison study shows that while there was no difference in pain control 6-8 hours post-anesthesia administration, quadriceps strength was spared more with use of saphenous nerve blockade at the level of the adductor canal. While our study verified adequate analgesia in the recovery room, duration has yet to be optimized.(Table Presented).""",English,0

The authors hypothesized that ACB, compared with FNB, would exhibit less quadriceps weakness and demonstrate noninferior pain score and opioid consumption at 6 to 8 h postanesthesia. METHODS: Patients received an ACB or FNB as a component of a multimodal analgesic. Quadriceps strength, pain score, and opioid consumption were assessed on both legs preoperatively and at 6 to 8, 24, and 48 h postanesthesia administration. In a joint hypothesis test, noninferiority was first evaluated on the primary outcomes of strength, pain score, and opioid consumption at 6 to 8 h; superiority on each outcome at 6 to 8 h was then assessed only if noninferiority was established. RESULTS: Forty-six patients received ACB; 47 patients received FNB. At 6 to 8 h postanesthesia, ACB patients had significantly higher median dynamometer readings versus FNB patients (median [interquartile range], 6.1 kgf [3.5, 10.9] (ACB) vs. 0 kgf [0.0, 3.9] (FNB); P < 0.0001), but was not inferior to FNB with regard to Numeric Rating Scale pain scores (1.0 [0.0, 3.5] ACB vs. 0.0 [0.0, 1.0] FNB; P = 0.019), or to opioid consumption (32.2 [22.4, 47.5] ACB vs. 26.6 [19.6, 49.0]; P = 0.0115). At 24 and 48 h postanesthesia, there was no significant statistical difference in dynamometer results, pain scores, or opioid use between the two groups.

To investigate whether a continuous incisional fascia iliaca compartment (FIC) block provides more effective postoperative pain relief with fewer side effects than IV morphine, we performed a prospective, double-blind, randomized study to compare both techniques. METHODS: Thirty children (ASA physical status I-II) aged 3 mo to 6 yr undergoing a pelvic osteotomy were included in the study. The children were randomized for either morphine IV and placebo (saline) via a FIC catheter (Group M) or placebo (saline) IV and ropivacaine via a FIC catheter (Group R). All patients received general anesthesia using inhaled sevoflurane and IV fentanyl. Perioperatively, a FIC catheter was placed by the surgeon. All patients received either a bolus dose of morphine IV (Group M) or ropivacaine 0.75% via the FIC catheter (Group R) at the end of surgery. Postoperatively, Group M received morphine IV 20 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) and Group R ropivacaine 0.2% 0.1 mL x kg(-1) x h(-1) via the FIC catheter. In both groups, saline was administered along the other route. All children were assessed for pain, sedation, time until first oral intake, and adverse effects for 48 h postoperatively. During this period, all children had a urinary catheter. RESULTS: The study was completed by 28 children. In the anesthetic recovery room, children in Group M had significantly higher pain scores. These children were also significantly more sedated during the study period. The incidence of vomiting did not differ between the groups; however, children in Group R had first oral intake significantly earlier than Group M. A local retrospective study revealed an incidence of urinary retention of 4.7% in the ropivacaine-treated patients and 39% in the morphine-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous incisional FIC block provides excellent postoperative pain relief, less sedation, and better return of appetite than morphine IV after pelvic osteotomy in children.",eng,1

A study was undertaken to test the effect of intraoperative bupivacaine on postoperative pain in children undergoing outpatient hernia repair. Ninety-nine children aged 1 to 7 years underwent outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia. Each was randomly assigned to receive bupivacaine (group 1) or saline (group 2), infiltrating the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves. Drug administration and patient evaluation were double-blinded. The groups were similar with respect to age, sex, side of procedure, and length of operation. In the immediate postoperative period, 17 group 1 patients required analgesics compared with 39 in group 2 (P less than .01); total codeine dosage was lower in group 1 (4.0 +/- 7.1 mg v 11.8 +/- 10.5 mg, P less than .05). Activity level 45 minutes after surgery (using a standardized scale) was greater in group 1 (P less than .05). Acetaminophen requirements at home were lower in group 1 on the day of surgery (3.1 +/- 4.3 mL v 5.7 +/- 7.4 mL, P less than .05) and over the following 48 hours (1.5 +/- 3.4 mL v 4.9 +/- 10.7 mL, P less than .05). Activity level at home on the day of surgery did not differ significantly between groups, but activity level over the following 48 hours was higher in group 1 (P less than .05). The two groups were similar with respect to all other parameters. We conclude that intraoperative bupivacaine decreases post-operative pain and analgesic use, and promotes early ambulation in children undergoing hernia repair.",eng,1

But pain delays the recovery and it increases the morbidity, including nausea and vomiting, and the maladaptive behavioral changes. This study was conducted to compare the effect of rectally administered paracetamol or diclofenac combined with regional nerve block with the traditional pain control method. METHODS: Two hundred forty one randomly selected pediatric patients were allocated into two groups. The empirical pain relief group (the control group, n = 120) included the patients that received intravenous sulpyrin and/or meperidine postoperatively. The patients in the multimodal preemptive pain relief group (the study group, n = 121) received regional nerve blockade with 0.25% bupivacaine combined with preoperative rectally administered paracetamol 45 mg/kg or diclofenac 1 mg/kg 60 min before surgery for cases that were to undergo lower abdominal surgery. But only paracetamol or diclofenac was rectally administered preoperatively in the other surgical cases. RESULTS: The mean time in the recovery room for the study group was shorter than that for the control group. The postoperative pain was hurts even more in 16.7%, worst in 11.8%, a whole lot in 26.5% and no pain in 27.5% of the control group patients. But the pain was hurts little more only in 11%, a little bit in 10.0% and no pain in 88.9% of the study group patients. The average postoperative VAS score was 0.21 +/- 0.6 in the study group and 8.36 +/- 1.7 in the control group, respectively.

We carried out a prospective, randomised, controlled, single-blind trial to test the hypothesis that multimodal analgesic regimen of pregabalin, paravertebral block and regular analgesics decreases the prevalence of PPSP compared to 'standard' analgesic regimen. Our secondary hypothesis was that associations exist between PPSP and genetic, neurophysiological, psychological and clinical parameters measured perioperatively. Methods: Fifty-one patients undergoing breast surgery were randomly allocated to either the control group, receiving 'as required' oral analgesics and intravenous morphine, or the intervention group, receiving a multimodal analgesic regimen consisting of perioperative pregabalin, paravertebral block and regular acetaminophen and diclofenac sodium. Clinical measurements included visual analogue scale for pain, area of hyperalgesia surrounding the surgical wound and pain catastrophising. Patients were interviewed three months postoperatively to determine the presence of persistent pain. Results: Twenty patients (20/51; 39.2%) developed PPSP. There was no difference in the incidence of PPSP between patients in the control and intervention groups (11/26; 42.3% vs 9/25; 36.0%, p = 0.39). Patients who developed PPSP and those who did not were similar in terms of perioperative clinical measurements. Conclusions: This study confirms the high prevalence (39%) of PPSP after surgery for breast cancer. The most important finding of this study is the failure to identify a benefit of a multimodal analgesic regimen consisting of perioperative pregabalin, paravertebral block and regular acetaminophen and diclofenac sodium in decreasing the incidence of PPSP three months after breast surgery compared to the 'standard' analgesic regimen described.",English Romanian,0

Wu,2007.0,The effect of analgesic technique on postoperative patient-reported outcomes including analgesia: a systematic review,10.1213/01.ane.0000278089.16848.1e,"BACKGROUND: The effect of postoperative analgesia on patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life, quality of recovery, and patient satisfaction, has not been systematically examined. These outcomes are assessed from the patient's perspective and are recognized as valid and important end-points in clinical medicine and research. We performed a systematic review to examine the effect of postoperative analgesia on patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: The National Library of Medicine's Medline and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for the past decade (Jan, 1996 to Jun 1, 2006). Additional Medline searches for specific outcomes (i.e., satisfaction, quality of life, and quality of recovery) were also conducted. RESULTS: Regional analgesic techniques provide statistically superior analgesia compared with systemic opioids. There are insufficient data to determine if the type of analgesic technique, degree of analgesia, and presence of side effects may influence quality of life, quality of recovery, satisfaction, and length of stay, due in part to some significant methodologic issues. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are data suggesting that improved postoperative analgesia leads to better patient outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to support subsequent improvements inpatient-centered outcomes such as quality of life and quality of recovery. Modest reductions in pain scores do not necessarily equate to clinically meaningful improved pain relief for the patient. Further studies are needed to develop validated patient-reported instruments and to assess the effect of analgesic techniques on patient-reported outcomes in the perioperative period.",eng,1

CP repair is associated with the risk of postoperative airway obstruction, which may be increased with administration of opioids, often needed for analgesia. No described regional anesthesia technique can provide adequate pain control following CP repair in infants. The primary aim of this prospective and descriptive study was to observe the effectiveness of bilateral maxillary nerve blocks (BMB) using a suprazygomatic approach on pain relief and consumption of rescue analgesics following CP repair in infants. Analgesic consumption was compared to retrospective data. Complications related to this new technique in infants were also reviewed. Methods: The landmarks and measurements recently defined in a three-dimensional study using computed tomography in infants were used. After general anesthesia, a BMB was performed bilaterally with 0.15 mlkg<sup>-1</sup> 0.2% ropivacaine in infants scheduled for CP repair. Postoperative analgesia, administration of rescue analgesics, adverse effects, and time to feed were recorded in the 48-h period following surgery and compared to retrospective data. Results: Thirty-three children, mean age 5 + 1.8 months and weight 8.3 + 1.2 kg, were studied. Eighteen patients out of 33 (55%) did not require additional opioids intra-operatively, vs two out of 20 (10%) without block. None needed morphine postoperatively, and intravenous nalbuphine was required in only six children (18%), vs 16 (80%) without block. Median time to feed was 8 h (range 2-24 h), vs 13 h (4-25) without block. No technical failure or complication related to the BMB was reported. Conclusion: BMB using a suprazygomatic approach seems to improve pain relief, to decrease peri-operative consumption of opioids, and to favor early feeding resumption after CP repair in infants. 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",English,0

We studied the efficacy of a 0.5% bupivacaine infraorbital nerve block as post-operative analgesia in a random, prospective, double blind manner in children undergoing cleft lip repair. Following the induction of anesthesia with ketamine 2-4 mg/kg im, 60 patients, aged 2-13 years, ASA I and II were equally divided: Group A received 1-1.5 ml bupivacaine, 0.5% with 1:200000 epinephrine; Group B received 1-1.5 ml saline injected into the vicinity of the infraorbital foramina. In every patient, the surgeon infiltrated the lip with 4-7 ml of 1% lidocaine with 1:100000 epinephrine for both anesthesia and hemostasis. Post-operative evaluations were completed after 4, 8, and 12 to 24 hours and were based on a visual analogue scale for pain. Similarly, the nurses and the parents also evaluated post-operative discomfort using specific criteria. All the observers were kept unaware of the solutions used for the block. The results showed that Group A was pain free for a mean duration of l9.4 + 5.06 (SD) hours in contrast to 11.7 + 6.1 9 hours for Group B, (p < 0.001). Group A required no other analgesic whereas a total of 17 patients in Group B required analgesic medication starting at four hours post-operatively, (p < 0.001). Both the nurses and the parents confirmed that those who received infraorbital block were more comfortable than those who did not. One-way analysis of variance indicates that the mean scores for both groups differs significantly at all levels of comparison, (p < 0.001). We concluded that analgesia from lidocaine infiltration in the operative site begins to wane after four hours. Thus, infraorbital nerve block with 0.5% bupivacaine is a simple and effective postoperative pain reliever in children following cheiloplasty.",English,1

Our purpose of this study was to compare the postoperative analgesic effects between psoas compartment block (PCB) and caudal block in small children undergoing open hip reduction/osteotomies. METHODS: Forty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II children aged 1 to 6 years planned to undergo open hip reduction/osteotomies were administered general anesthesia and then randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 regional anesthetics: caudal block (group C, n=20) or PCB (group P, n=20). Ropivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine (5 mug/mL) was used in both blocks. The primary outcome of the study was the total consumption of morphine in the first 24 postoperative hrs. Secondary outcomes included dose of intraoperative fentanyl, occurrence of intraoperative hypotension or bradycardia, postoperative pain scores, time to first morphine analgesia, and occurrence of postoperative vomiting or urine retention. RESULTS: The cumulative dose of morphine administered in the ward in the first postoperative 24 hrs and the time to first rescue morphine dose were higher in group C than in group P (P<0.001). There were no differences between the 2 groups regarding intraoperative and postoperative complications except for the incidence of urine retention, which was higher in group C than in group P (P=0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Use of single-shot PCB is superior to single-shot caudal block regarding length of postoperative analgesia and cumulative dose of morphine in small children undergoing open hip reduction/osteotomies.",eng,0

Ahlen,2014.0,Ropivacaine for Continuous Wound Infusion for Postoperative Pain Management: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,10.1159/000363233,"Background: The use of continuous wound infusion (CWI) of local anaesthetics has been suggested as a safe and effective alternative technique to epidural anaesthesia/analgesia that allows surgeons to provide postoperative pain relief while reducing opioid consumption and associated adverse events. A previous meta-analysis by Liu et al. [Am Coll Surg 2006;203:914-932] reported results mainly from studies of bupivacaine. Subsequently, several new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ropivacaine have been published. This systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy of ropivacaine for CWI. Methods: Systematic literature searches (EMBASE, MEDLINE) were performed to retrieve studies which met the following criteria: double-blind RCT of ropivacaine versus either placebo or an active comparator; use of ropivacaine solution without added active agents, and prohibition of other routine analgesics during the study period except rescue patient-controlled analgesia. For each included study, standardized effect sizes for ropivacaine versus placebo were calculated for opioid rescue use, pain score at rest, and pain score at mobilization. Meta-analyses were conducted for each endpoint. Results: Fourteen RCTs comparing ropivacaine (n = 376) versus placebo (n = 380) were identified. Effect size estimates revealed significantly less opioid rescue use for ropivacaine patients (-1.3; 95% CI -1.5 to -1.1) and significantly less pain for ropivacaine patients both at rest (-1.1; 95% CI -1.3 to -0.9) and on mobilization (-1.5; 95% CI -1.7 to -1.3). The weighted mean reduction in opioid rescue use was 22.4 mg. Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis presents substantial evidence that ropivacaine provides clinically meaningful reductions in opioid use and pain outcomes. Ropivacaine CWI is effective for postoperative pain management in a wide range of surgical procedures. (c) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Eng,0

A randomized, double-blind, prospective study",10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.09.024,"BACKGROUND: Pain control after thoracotomy prevents postsurgical complications and improves respiratory function. The gold standard for post-thoracotomy analgesia is the epidural catheter. The aim of this study was to compare it with a new technique that involves placement of a catheter in the paravertebral space at the end of surgery under a surgeon's direct vision. METHODS: From November 2011 to June 2012, 52 patients were randomized into 2 groups depending on catheter placement: an epidural catheter for group A and a paravertebral catheter for group B. At 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery, the following parameters were recorded: (1) pain control using the patient's completion of a visual analog scale module, (2) respiratory function using forced expiratory volume in 1 second and ambient air saturation, and (3) blood cortisol values as an index of systemic reaction to pain. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P < .05) were found in favor of group B for both cough and rest pain control (P = .002 and .002, respectively) and respiratory function in terms of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and ambient air saturation levels (P = .023 and .001, respectively). No statistically significant differences were found in blood cortisol trends between the 2 groups (P > .05). Collateral effects such as vomiting, nausea, low pressure, or urinary retention were observed only in group A. No collateral effects were recorded in the paravertebral group. CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, drugs administered through a paravertebral catheter are very effective. Moreover, it does not present contraindications to its positioning or collateral effects. More studies are necessary to confirm data we collected.",eng,1

This study has tried to investigate the effects of parasternal single injection of bupivacaine on postoperative pulmonary and pain consequences in patients after open heart surgery. Methods: In a prospective double blind clinical study, 100 consenting patients undergoing elective open heart surgery were randomized into two groups. In case group, bupivacaine was injected at both sides of sternum, immediately before sternal closure. In the control group, no intervention was performed. Then, the patients were investigated regarding intubation period, length of ICU stay, arterial blood gas (ABG) parameters, morphine requirement, and their severity of postoperative pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) device. Results: No differences were found between the two groups regarding to age, sex, pump time, operation time, and body mass index and preoperative cardiac ejection fraction. Mean intubation length in case group was much shorter than that in control group. Mean PaO<sub>2</sub> in case group was lower in different checking times in postoperative period. The patients in the case group needed less morphine compared to those in the control group during the 24-hour observation period in the ICU. Finally, mean VAS scores of pain in case group were significantly lower than those in control group at 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. Conclusions: Patients' pain relief by parasternal single injection of bupivacaine in early postoperative period can facilitate earlier ventilator weaning and tracheal extubation after open heart surgery as well as achieving lower pain scores and narcotic requirements.",English,1

This technique may provide insufficient analgesia for intraoperative management as the inguinal region may receive sensory innervation from genitofemoral nerve. We proposed that addition of a genitofemoral nerve block might improve the quality of analgesia. METHODS: Ninety-eight children undergoing inguinal hernia repair were assigned randomly to receive either IG-IH nerve block (Group I) or IG-IH and genitofemoral nerve blocks (Group II). Systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded before surgery (control), after skin incision, at sac traction and at the end of surgery. Postoperative analgesic requirements and incidence of complications were recorded until discharge. RESULTS: At sac traction, SAP and HR were significantly higher in Group I (P<0.05), and the incidence of episodes of increased HR was also significantly higher in Group II (29 vs 12%, respectively, P<0.05). There were no significant differences in SAP and HR at other time points, postoperative analgesic requirements or incidence of complications between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of the additional genitofemoral nerve block to IG-IH nerve block was limited only to the time of sac traction without any postoperative effect.

In this study, we evaluated the analgesic efficacy and morphine consumption of the two techniques after mastectomy. METHODS: Forty-eight patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection were randomly assigned to either a preoperative PVB with 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.5% (group PVB) or a continuous ropivacaine 0.5% infusion (CRI) at a 2 mL/h rate for each of two multilumen catheters placed subcutaneously at the end of the procedure (group CRI). The catheters were left in place for 24 h postoperatively. A standardized general anesthetic was administered to all patients. Postoperative morphine consumption, pain scores and painful restricted movement of the shoulder for 24 h postoperatively as well as incidence of adverse events, including postoperative nausea and vomiting, were recorded.

However, sciatic n block including the common peroneal component generally results in paresis or paralysis of dorsiflexion (footdrop). Peroneal n injury is a rare but well documented risk after TKA, usually manifesting as a postoperative footdrop with an incidence of 0.3%-10% (2). Since a potential delay in diagnosing peroneal n palsy due to surgery in patients with sciatic n block exists, surgeons may request no pre-operative sciatic n block for analgesia in their TKA patients. This prospective, randomized, observer-blinded study was designed to determine if placing a selective tibial n block in the popliteal fossa will avoid foot drop, but still provide post-operative analgesia comparable to patients who receive sciatic n block. Methods: Patients scheduled for primary TKA gave written consent to participate in this IRB- approved study. Patients with pre-existing valgus deformity, flexion contracture, neuropathy or diabetes were excluded. Patients were randomized by sealed envelopes to receive either a sciatic n block (SN group) or selective tibial n block (TN group). All patients were premedicated as per our multimodal analgesia regimen (Table 1). An ultrasound guided continuous femoral n block was placed with 15ml of ropivacaine 0.5%. Patients randomized to SN group received an ultrasound-guided sciatic n block just proximal to the bifurcation of the sciatic n while patients in the TN group received a tibial n block below the bifurcation and close to the popliteal crease. Sufficient ropivacaine 0.5% was injected to encircle the target nerve, up to 20ml. General anesthesia was supplemented with fentanyl or hydromorphone if needed. In the PACU, sensorimotor function was tested by blinded PACU nurses including dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, and sensation to cold (alcohol swab) on the planter aspect and dorsum of foot using a three point scale (0=normal, 1=decreased and 2=absent). Foot drop was defined as the inability to dorsiflex the foot against gravity. Standard analgesia protocol was continued post surgery(Table 1). Pain scores and narcotic consumption in PACU and 24 hours after PACU discharge were tracked. Results: This data describes the results of 53 patients recruited to this study to date. There were no differences in the demographic variables. A higher volume of ropivacaine (15.2 vs 9.5ml) was injected in the SN group (Table 2). No patient in the TN group, while 80% of patients in SN group demonstrated footdrop(p<0.001)(Figure 1). Pain scores and narcotic consumption after surgery were similar between groups. Discussion: Preliminary results suggests that selective tibial n block provides equivalent analgesia in conjunction with femoral n block without causing footdrop. The ability to monitor peroneal n function after surgery is a distinct advantage of selective tibial n block over sciatic n block. (Table presented).",English,0

Majority of patients are young and healthy, expecting rapid recovery and early mobilization. Optimizing pain control in such patients is quite challenging. We aimed to provide an optimal pain control with focus on procedural anatomy by blocking two relevant nerves using low dose local anesthetic. Materials and Methods:We included 100 patients (ASA I) undergoing arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Ethical committee approval was obtained. Patients were randomized in two groups: group A (n=50) received preoperative blockade (ultrasound-guided) of saphenous and sciatic nerve with the same dose of local anesthetic mixture : 0.375% levobupivacaine and 4 mg dexamethasone, combined with unilateral spinal anesthesia. Group B received only unilateral spinal anesthesia (our standard approach for this procedure), followed by tramadol and metamizole intravenously for postoperative analgesia. We measured intraoperative and postoperative pain control using visual analogue scale (VAS), as well as postoperative nausea, iv fluid intake, early mobilization and patient satisfaction. Results: Intraoperative VAS was similar in both groups. Postoperative VAS was significantly lower in A group compared to group B. Early mobilization was found to be worse in group B as well as nausea and patient satisfaction scores. Greater iv fluid intake was found in group B, while group A could take fluid orally.

Regional anaesthesia is a valid strategy to improve postoperative pain in the adult surgical population, but the effects of regional anaesthesia on postoperative pain outcomes in paediatric patients are currently not well defined. The main objective of the current review was to systematically evaluate the use of regional anaesthesia techniques to minimize postoperative pain in paediatric patients. A systematic search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of the regional anaesthesia techniques on postoperative pain outcomes in paediatric surgical patients' procedures. Seventy-three studies on 5125 paediatric patients were evaluated. Only few surgical procedures had more than one small randomized controlled trial favouring the use of regional anaesthesia to minimize postoperative pain (ophthalmological surgery, cleft lip repair, inguinal hernia, and urological procedures). Additional evidence is required to support the use of specific regional anaesthesia techniques to improve postoperative pain for several surgical procedures (craniectomy, adenotonsillectomy, appendectomy, cardiac surgery, umbilical hernia repair, upper and lower extremity) in paediatric patients. Currently, only a very limited number of regional anaesthesia techniques have demonstrated significant improvement on postoperative pain outcomes for a restricted number of surgical procedures. More studies are needed in order to establish regional anaesthesia as a valid strategy to improve analgesia in the paediatric surgical population.",Eng,1

The local anaesthetic used was a mixture of 1% lignocaine and 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine. The success rate, time of onset of block, duration of postoperative analgesia, number of missed nerves in each patient and complications were compared. The success rate was highest in the PS group (90%), followed by PNS group (86.67%) and TA group (83.33%) without any statistically significant difference. The onset of motor block was 8.5 minutes and sensory block was 13.5 minutes with postoperative analgesia lasting for 175-250 minutes. The local anaesthetic used by us provides early onset time and long lasting postoperative analgesia without motor paralysis. Total incidence of missed nerve was 27.06%, the musculocutaneous nerve being the commonest missed nerve. Even though the success rate was similar in all the 3 techniques, we recommend the TA technique because it is easy to perform, provides a definite end point, does not require any sophisticated equipment and avoids nerve damage, which may be associated with the PS technique. We conclude that the axillary brachial plexus block is a safe technique for patients undergoing outpatient upper extremity surgery.",English,0

However, data extracted from the Danish Anaesthesia Database showed that a third of these patients needed opioids for PPM. The bilateral dual (BD) - TAP blockade combines the classical TAP block (lower abdomen) and the upper intercostal TAP block (epigastric area). We hypothesized that anaesthesia of the entire anterior abdominal wall (Th6-Th12) resulting from the BD-TAP block would benefit patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery with several port holes and CO2-distention of the abdominal wall. Materials and Methods: Following IRB approval 56 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery due to acute appendicitis were randomized to receive either a BD-TAP blockade with ropivacaine 0.375% or isotonic saline. Blocks were performed after induction of general anaesthesia. Patients were all administered 0.2 mg/kg morphine intravenously and 15 ml carbocaine 2% in the surgical incisions as PPM. Primary outcome measure was pain assessment during mobilization using the numerical rating scale (NRS 0-10). Secondary outcome measures were pain assessment at rest, overall opioid consumption (patient controlled analgesia with morphine), length of stay in recovery and time to first mobilization. Results: A pilot study of ten cases showed a significant reduction in postoperative pain score even in patients with a ruptured appendix. Additional outcome measures will be presented at ESRA. Conclusions: The BD-TAP blockade could be a supplement to standard PPM after laparoscopic surgery thus minimizing pain and opioid consumption. (Figure Presented).",English,0

METHODS: After institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained, 200 children were randomized in this double blind, prospective, randomized controlled trial to receive either a nerve block of the auricular branch of the Vagus (Nerve of Arnold) with 0.2 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine or receive intranasal fentanyl 2 mcg.kg(-1) after induction of general anesthesia. Patients were monitored in the recovery room for analgesia, need for additional analgesia, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and time to discharge from the hospital. Additional analgesics administered in the PACU, surgical short-stay unit as well as at home were also recorded. RESULTS: There was no difference in the pain scores between groups (P = 0.53); there was no difference in the amount of rescue medications between groups (P = 0.86); there was no difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting between groups (P = 0.34); there was no difference in the time to discharge between groups (P = 0.5).

Orlikowski,2008.0,A randomised study of ilio-inguinal nerve blocks following inguinal hernia repair: a stopped randomised controlled trial,10.1016/j.ijsu.2007.10.003,"BACKGROUND: Local anaesthetic use for post-operative pain control is widely used following open inguinal hernia repair but this is not without risk. The aim of this study was to compare ilio-inguinal nerve block and wound irrigation in patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair under general anaesthetic in a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. METHODS: Adult patients admitted for unilateral primary open mesh repair of an inguinal hernia were recruited. The patients received a standard general anaesthetic. Prior to skin incision, an ilio-inguinal injection was performed by the anaesthetist with either ropivicaine or normal saline. Prior to closure of the wound, the wound was irrigated with either ropivicaine or normal saline. Post-operatively, all patients received fentynal patient controlled analgesia and regular oral analgesia. Pain scores and visual analogue scores were recorded until discharge. Patients were then contacted by telephone at 24h, 48h, 2weeks and 4weeks post-operatively and asked a standard series of questions, mainly related to post-operative pain. RESULTS: After 12 patients had been recruited the trial was stopped as 5 of the 8 patients who received an ilio-inguinal nerve block suffered a neurological complication. CONCLUSION: Ilio-inguinal nerve block with ropivicaine should be avoided.",eng,1

Our objective was to assess the effect of dorsal penile nerve block with bupivacaine on urethral catheter-related pain after RARP. METHODS: From 2012-2013, 140 patients with organ-confined prostate cancer were enrolled in an IRB approved double-blinded, randomized control trial comparing a dorsal penile nerve block of bupivacaine versus placebo after RARP performed by a single-surgeon. Patients were asked to complete questionnaires using the Wong-Bakers FACES Pain Rating scale while hospitalized and for 9 days post-operatively, until the catheter was removed. The primary end-points were: catheter-related discomfort, abdominal (incisional) pain, and bladder spasm-related discomfort. Secondary end-points included narcotic and other analgesic usage. RESULTS: 120 patients were randomized to placebo vs. bupivacaine dorsal penile nerve bock. The two arms (n = 56 bupivacaine and n = 60 placebo) did not differ in preoperative, perioperative, or pathological results. There was no difference in narcotic utilization between the two cohorts. Abdominal pain was slightly lower in the bupivacaine arm at 6 hours compared to the placebo arm, but there was no difference in abdominal pain at other time points, and there were no differences in reported catheter-related discomfort or bladder spasm-associated discomfort at any of the measured time points. CONCLUSIONS: The data does not support the routine use of a dorsal penile nerve block with bupivacaine following RARP.",eng,0

Kehlet,2014.0,Neural blockade for persistent pain after breast cancer surgery,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AAP.0000000000000101,"Persistent pain after breast cancer surgery is predominantly a neuropathic pain syndrome affecting 25% to 60% of patients and related to injury of the intercostobrachial nerve, intercostal nerves, and other nerves in the region. Neural blockade can be useful for the identification of nerves involved in neuropathic pain syndromes or to be used as a treatment in its own right. The purpose of this review was to examine the evidence for neural blockade as a potential diagnostic tool or treatment for persistent pain after breast cancer surgery. In this systematic review, we found only 7 studies (n = 135) assessing blocks directed at 3 neural structures - stellate ganglion, paravertebral plexus, and intercostal nerves - but none focusing on the intercostobrachial nerve. The quality of the studies was low and efficacy inconclusive, suggesting a need for well-designed, high-quality studies for this common clinical problem. 2014 American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.",English,0

Results from thoracic and other surgical procedures suggest multiple pathogenic mechanisms that include pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors. This review attempts to analyse the methodology and systematics of the studies on the post-thoracotomy pain syndrome (PTPS) after lung cancer surgery in adults, in order to clarify the relative role of possible pathogenic factors and to define future strategies for prevention. Literature published from 2000 to 2008 together with studies included in previous systematic reviews was searched recursively using PubMed and OVID by combining three categories of search terms. The available data have major inconsistencies in collection of pre-, intra- and postoperative data that may influence PTPS, thereby hindering precise conclusions as well as preventive and treatment strategies. However, intercostal nerve injury seems to be the most important pathogenic factor. Since there is a general agreement on the clinical relevance of PTPS, a proposal for design of future trials is presented. 2009 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.",English,1

Tam,2014.0,Local anesthetic infusion pump for pain management following open inguinal hernia repair: a meta-analysis,10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.01.006,"OBJECTIVES: Open inguinal hernia repair is one of the most painful procedures in day surgery. A continuous ambulatory analgesic is thought to reduce postoperative pain when it is applied to the surgical site. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of local anesthetic infusion pump following open inguinal hernia repair for the reduction of postoperative pain. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have investigated the outcomes of using an infusion pump for delivering a local anesthetic contrasted to a control group for open inguinal hernia repair. Pain was assessed from Day 1 to Day 5 following the surgery. The secondary outcomes included analgesia use and postoperative complications. RESULTS: We reviewed 5 trials that totaled 288 patients. The analgesic effects of bupivacaine (4 trials) and ropivacaine (one trial) were compared with a placebo group. The pooled mean difference in the score measuring the degree of pain diminished significantly at Day 1 to Day 4 in the experimental group. Two studies have reported that the number of analgesics required also decreased in the experimental group. No bupivacaine-related complication was reported. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that applying a local anesthetic infusion pump following inguinal hernia repairs was more efficacious for reducing postoperative pain than a placebo. However, the findings were based on a small body of evidence in which methodological quality was not high. The potential benefits of applying a local anesthetic infusion pump to hernia repair must still be adequately investigated using further RCTs.",eng,1
