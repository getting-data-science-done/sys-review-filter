Studies of Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) on patients aged 18 years or over with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 to 39.9 kg/m2 who have one or more major medical comorbidities (including sleep apnoea, hypertension, diabetes, excessive abdominal weight, lipid abnormalities, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease or liver disease) and have failed first- and second-line treatment options. Looking for comparative studies of Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty plus lifestyle interventions (behavioural therapy, diet and exercise) with or without pharmacotherapy. Including two comparative scenarios. Firstly, patients with a BMI of 30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2 who undergo lifestyle interventions (behavioural therapy, diet and exercise) with or without pharmacotherapy. Secondly patients with a BMI of 35.0 to 39.9 kg/m2 who undergo sleeve gastrectomy or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding plus lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise and behavioural therapy) with or without pharmacotherapy. Include safety outcomes covering the incidence and severity of minor adverse events (for example, abdominal pain and chest, nausea, vomiting, reflux, pneumoperitoneum), serious adverse events (for example, gastric leaks, serous fluid collections, pulmonary embolism and pneumothorax), device-related adverse events, complications (for example, injury to gastrointestinal tract or stomach, bleeding), mortality, blood loss, length of hospital stay, revision rates, conversion rates, rates of sutures reopening and long-term other risks (for example, Barrettâ€™s oesophagus). Include efficacy outcomes covering durable (> 5 years), total body and excess weight loss, impact on metabolic comorbidities (for example, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, cardiovascular disease, steatohepatitis), operative success and unplanned/planned revision, reversal or conversion rates. As well as secondary outcomes: Health-related quality of life, percentage of sleeves intact at follow-up, function of the plicated stomach, nutritional profile, joint health, number of missed days of work/school/activity, hospitalisation (obesity-related) and frequency of obesity-related medication. Include also healthcare cost impacts, cost per quality-adjusted life year, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, Australian Government healthcare costs and patient costs.
